story_reviews_00000,"Scientists have found an unexpected use for virtual reality headsets: to help pinpoint people who may later develop Alzheimer’s disease.

The devices, widely used by computer gamers, display images that can be used to test the navigational skills of people thought to be at risk of dementia. Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s later in life, scientists now believe.

By identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present, researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition.

“It is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in Alzheimer’s,” said project leader Dennis Chan, a neuroscientist based at Cambridge University. “But difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms. This may predate the onset of other symptoms.

“By pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills, we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them.”

The discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with Alzheimer’s disease was made several years ago by Chan and colleagues based at several centres in the UK. These studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks.

But now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate.

Around 300 people, aged between 40 and 60, will be recruited to take part in the study. Some will have a gene that puts them at risk of the condition or will come from a family with a history of Alzheimer’s. Not all will be destined to be affected by the disease, however. Chan’s project aims to find out who will.

Wearing virtual reality headsets, participants will be asked to navigate their way towards, and then remember details of, a series of different environments.

“We will make a note of those who have particular problems and see if these are the ones who are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” explained Chan. “The aim of the study is very simple: can we detect changes in brain function before people are aware that they have them?”

Researchers recently pinpointed the significance of a tiny area of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex, which acts as a hub in a widespread brain network that controls navigation. This now appears to be the first part of the brain that succumbs to Alzheimer’s.

“The entorhinal cortex is the first brain region to show degeneration when you get Alzheimer’s, and that is where we shall be focusing our research,” said Chan, whose work is funded by the Alzheimer’s Society.

The goal of the work is to help people as they develop the disease. “To date, drug trials for Alzheimer’s have been applied when people have already got dementia, by which time considerable damage to the brain has already occurred,” Chan told the Observer.

“If we can develop drugs and administer them earlier, for instance before the disease has spread beyond the entorhinal cortex, then this would have the potential to prevent the onset of dementia.”",Virtual reality to help detect early risk of Alzheimer’s,1,The Guardian
story_reviews_00001,"(Reuters) - Evofem Biosciences Inc said on Monday its birth control gel showed effectiveness in a late-stage study, bringing the first hormone-free contraceptive close to approval and sending its shares up 27 percent before the bell.

Male condoms and oral pills dominate the $5.5 billion contraceptive market in the United States. However, oral pills cause side effects such as bleeding between periods, mood swings and nausea in women.

“These results pave the way for Amphora’s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women’s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said.

The gel works by regulating vaginal pH within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5, creating a hostile environment for sperm and certain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.

Amphora was found to have a 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said.

Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell said he expects Amphora, the company’s lead product, to bring in peak sales of $415 million by 2032.

The company plans to resubmit the marketing application for Amphora in the second quarter next year and if approved, plans to launch the product in January 2020.

story_reviews_00002,"A Chicago couple who previously suffered two miscarriages recently welcomed a healthy baby boy thanks to a breakthrough new fertility test which helps women struggling with achieving a successful pregnancy by examining the mother's DNA.

The test is offering new hope to many family's struggling to conceive.

Carolyn Bilson and Tim O'Brien met three years ago, and say it was love at first sight.

""Literally a month later we knew, we wanted to have children,"" Bilson told ""Good Morning America.""

But after two miscarriages, Bilson, then pushing 40, said the couple sought help from a fertility specialist in Chicago who recommended in vitro fertilization.

Their first attempt at IVF, however, failed too, according to Bilson.

""I think it was just so devastating, because we didn't anticipate that,"" she said. ""We thought the hard part would be getting pregnant, not staying pregnant.""

O'Brien added that the most ""frustrating thing"" was that ""you didn't learn anything from the previous miscarriage. So, there wasn't, 'What could we do differently?'""

The couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the DNA of the mother, using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception, based on that DNA.

ABCNews.com

The Endometrial Receptivity Test uses a tissue sample to look at 238 genes to find out the optimum time for conception, thus increasing the couple's chance to conceive.

For Bilson, that time is two days later than the average woman.

Dr. Ilan Tur-Kaspa, an OB-GYN and the director of Chicago's Institute for Human Reproduction, described the process as ""personalized medicine.""

OB-GYN Dr. Jessica Shepherd told ""GMA"" that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant, when it is something they never thought they could look forward to.

The new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the women's endometrial tissue, which you can get DNA from, and from that DNA you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via IVF, Shepherd added.

Shepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40, but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum.

One risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying, Shepherd said.

After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the 1,048 participants treated with Tremfya showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, compared with 70 percent on Novartis’s Cosentyx, J&J said.

J&J is positioning Tremfya as a better alternative to Cosentyx as it seeks to take market share away from Novartis’s drug, which was launched two years ago and is among the top-selling treatments in the $11 billion global psoriasis market.

That market is expected to double to $21.11 billion by 2022, according to U.S. consultant Grand View Research.

With $2.1 billion in sales in 2017, Cosentyx has become one of the top revenue earners for Novartis and is expected to make up for falling revenue from its blood cancer treatment, Gleevec, whose patent expired two years ago.

On a media briefing following the release of J&J’s trial results, Novartis said it expected the data to have “limited clinical relevance” and no impact on plans to expand the Cosentyx label.

J&J also said Cosentyx demonstrated quicker effectiveness than Tremfya during the study.

“These results imply that Cosentyx remains a good option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients that want to achieve more rapid skin clearance,” brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note following the results.

“We see Cosentyx secure as a mainstay psoriasis therapy.”

Psoriasis is a chronic condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells, resulting in inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful.

About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have moderate-to-severe form of the disease, J&J said.

FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hot flashes, a common curse in menopause, can be especially bothersome after breast cancer. But a new study suggests an existing medication may help.

The drug is oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), long used to treat urinary incontinence.

The study found that women taking the medicine had an average of five fewer hot flashes a week, compared with three fewer among women taking a placebo.

""Oxybutynin is an option that can control these symptoms and improve quality of life,"" said lead researcher Dr. Roberto Leon-Ferre, an assistant professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

There are a couple of reasons for severe hot flashes after breast cancer. Chemotherapy may induce early menopause, and drugs that reduce estrogen levels may make hot flashes worse, the research team noted.

Hormone replacement therapy, which is often recommended for menopausal symptoms, is generally not advised for breast cancer survivors. That's left women who can't take hormones at a disadvantage.

Oxybutynin blocks a substance in the brain, and one of its side effects is decreased sweating, Leon-Ferre noted.

""Because of this, we can take advantage of the 'side effect' and decrease involuntary sweating associated with hot flashes, and decrease the hot flashes as well,"" he explained.

The drug could be game-changing for certain women, said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.

""This is a really important advance in survivorship and compassionate cancer care,"" added Police, who wasn't involved in the study.

Because oxybutynin is already available for other conditions, Leon-Ferre said doctors could prescribe it off-label.

However, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren't known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said.

For example, the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients, studies indicate.

For the new study, Leon-Ferre and his colleagues randomly assigned 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week to oxybutynin or a placebo.

Almost two-thirds were also taking drugs to prevent a return of breast cancer, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.

The women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low-dose oxybutynin twice a day for six weeks; low-dose oxybutynin for one week followed by an increased dose; or a placebo.

Both doses appeared to reduce hot flashes better than the placebo.

And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors.

Most insurance covers oxybutynin, and a month's supply can range from $21 to $42. With insurance, copays would be less, he added.

Side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating, the researchers found.

Women taking oxybutynin also reported improvement in work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep and overall quality of life.

These are vital issues, Police said. ""I will never forget the first time a patient said, 'Thank you for curing my breast cancer, but you ruined my life,' "" she said.

The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. As a result, she was having trouble at work and in all other aspects of her life, Police recalled.

""Her intimate relationship was also suffering, as nighttime had become a battleground between her and her internal temperature control,"" Police said.

The patient said she was willing to stop her hormone therapy and risk the return of breast cancer rather than live with her current symptoms, she said.

""This study makes me hopeful that these patients may have a way out of their dilemma,"" Police said. ""Instead of just telling them they should be happy to be alive, we may be able to offer a reliable treatment for some of the debilitating side effects of our treatments for breast cancer.""

The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.

A study published Monday is pushing back against the notion that up to 40 percent of Americans should be taking statin drugs to reduce the risk of heart disease. The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, argues that current medical guidelines haven't adequately considered the risks from these widely used drugs.

""Some harms are mentioned, but it's entirely unclear how they were considered when coming up with the recommendations,"" says Milo Puhan, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Zurich and senior author of the new study. ""In our approach we very explicitly considered the harms.""

It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. On the other hand, the benefits aren't that great, either. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say.

The most common side effect of these drugs is muscle pain, which usually goes away if patients stop taking the medicines. People taking statins are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is harder to reverse.

Puhan also found that some statins were more effective than others, with atorvastatin (the generic name for Lipitor) being the best of the bunch. He notes that physician guidelines don't generally compare the relative value of these drugs, which are all available as inexpensive generics.

He also finds that benefits fade compared with harms as people get older. ""The elderly do not benefit as much as previous studies might have thought,"" he says.

""One size doesn't fit it all,"" he concludes. ""That's a very important message.""

Puhan says, based on his assessment, perhaps 15 to 20 percent of older adults should be taking statins – far less than the 30 or 40 percent suggested by current medical guidelines.

""I think for me, as a physician,"" says Ilana Richman, an internist at the Yale School of Medicine, ""this kind of data suggests that if we give more weight to the potential for adverse events, then maybe it's reasonable to hold off for lower-risk patients.""

She co-wrote an editorial about the paper and came away from it thinking that doctors need to spend more time talking about the plusses and minuses of statin treatment, personalizing their recommendations more than they do now. She says it's a challenge to convey these sophisticated concepts in the short amount of time doctors have to spend with their patients.

Yet that kind of dialog is increasingly the expectation. In mid-November, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published new guidelines calling for more nuanced conversations around who would most benefit from statins.

Scott Grundy, a physician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who chaired the guidelines committee, says the new recommendations urge people in this gray area to get a special kind of CT scan that looks for calcium deposits in heart arteries, a signal for clogs that could cause trouble.

""If you have no coronary calcium, then your chances of having a heart attack over the next 10 years are very low,"" he says.

And it turns out that perhaps 40 percent of people who are identified as candidates based on their risk factors such as cholesterol levels and age actually have clear heart arteries, Grundy says. ""That means a lot of people are going to be treated unnecessarily if they don't have the calcium scan.""

But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention.

And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease. Statins are routinely prescribed for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke. For those patients (who weren't included in the Swiss analysis), the benefits are so clear ""it's almost mandatory to be on a statin drug,"" Grundy says.

He disagrees with a lot of the particulars in the Swiss study. So does cardiologist Roger Blumenthal, who heads the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins. ""The harms [analyzed in the paper] can be dealt with by a smart clinician,"" he says.

Yet both the new guidelines and the latest study agree on an important point: Doctors and patients should spend more time reviewing the benefits and risks of statins, with attention paid to each person's particular circumstances.

TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) --What if a simple zap to the spine could relieve the debilitating lower back and leg pain brought on by a herniated disk?

Such is the promise of ""pulse radiofrequency"" therapy (pRF), which sends inflammation-reducing pulses of energy to nerve roots in the spine, a new study claims.

The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s.

But recent advances in CT scan technology now enable clinicians to deploy those energy pulses with much more accuracy, experts said. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.

""I was amazed with the results of pRF,"" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. ""Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.""

And as a patient himself, Napoli added that ""from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.""

Napoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.

He and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Lower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.

Standard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.

The problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.

""Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,"" he noted. And though surgery safety has ""largely improved,"" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.

By contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.

""The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,"" he explained. ""Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.""

For the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.

All the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.

By the one-year mark following either treatment, a full ""perceived"" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.

Dr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.

He noted that because ""the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,"" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.

Still, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that ""the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.""

Nevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.

""Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,"" said Park. ""It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.""

story_reviews_00007,"The age-old answer to inventing a cure for cancer hasn't quite happened yet, but science took another large leap forward. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday night it granted accelerated approval to Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker).

This is the second time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker across different types of tumors rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated.

In layman's terms — it means doctors and researchers can attack cancer at the root of biographical markers in a body, rather than focusing on one point where a tumor originated, like the breast, colon or other cancerous organ.

""Today’s approval marks another step in an important shift toward treating cancers based on their tumor genetics rather than their site of origin in the body,"" said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. ""This new site-agnostic oncology therapy isn’t specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ, such as breast or colon cancer. Its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine.

""We now have the ability to make sure that the right patients get the right treatment at the right time. This type of drug development program, which enrolled patients with different tumors but a common gene mutation, wouldn’t have been possible a decade ago because we knew a lot less about such cancer mutations.

The early beginnings of larotrectinib was studied in three clinical trials that included 55 pediatric and adult patients with solid tumors that had an identified NTRK gene fusion without a resistance mutation and were metastatic or where surgical resection was likely to result in severe morbidity, according to the FDA's statement. These patients had no satisfactory alternative treatments or had cancer that progressed following treatment.

Larotrectinib demonstrated a 75 percent overall response rate across different types of solid tumors. These responses were durable, with 73 percent of responses lasting at least six months, and 39 percent lasting a year or more at the time results were analyzed. Examples of tumor types with an NTRK fusion that responded to larotrectinib include soft tissue sarcoma, salivary gland cancer, infantile fibrosarcoma, thyroid cancer and lung cancer.

Vitrakvi received an accelerated approval, which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is thought to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to confirm Vitrakvi’s clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies.

""Using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes, we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients,"" the FDA stated. ""This is especially true when it comes to pediatric cancers. We’re committed to continuing to advance a more modern framework of clinical trial designs that support more targeted innovations across disease types based on our growing understanding of the underlying biology of diseases like cancer.""

Common side effects reported by patients in clinical trials receiving Vitrakvi include fatigue, nausea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting, and increased AST and ALT enzyme blood levels in the liver.

Health care providers are advised to monitor patient ALT and AST liver tests every two weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly and as clinically indicated. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Vitrakvi because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby.

An experimental vaccine that could hold off Alzheimer's disease showed promising results in animal testing, according to researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Testing in mice showed that the vaccine safely prevents the buildup of substances in the brain associated with the fatal disease, the team reported this week in the journal Alzheimer's Research & Therapy.

There has been research in monkeys and rabbits as well, and the researchers hope the vaccine will progress to human trials.

If the vaccine proves safe and effective in humans, it could slice the number of dementia diagnoses in half, the study's senior author told USA TODAY.

More:The hidden side of dementia: Families fight over care, end-of-life decisions, finances, estates

Dementia is a term used to broadly describe symptoms of cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

Doris Lambracht-Washington, a professor of neurology and neurotherapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said researchers believe the vaccine could extend lives by preventing the disease from developing.

“If the onset of the disease could be delayed by even five years, that would be enormous for the patients and their families,” Lambracht-Washington said in a statement. “The number of dementia cases could drop by half.”

Lambracht-Washington said the study marks major progress toward a safe and effective vaccine.

Previous attempts to find an Alzheimer's vaccine either caused harmful side effects, such as brain inflammation, or used less effective approaches, she said.

The vaccine works by prompting the body to produce antibodies inhibiting the buildup of amyloid and tau, two proteins that are hallmarks of the degenerative brain disease.

The vaccine is one of several promising treatments aimed at reducing the buildup of those substances before they become deadly plaques and tangles in the brain.

story_reviews_00009,"(CNN) Sometimes, Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

""I wanted to sit with my good, good friends, but I couldn't,"" the 10-year-old said. ""If you're a kid and you have a food allergy, it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.""

Mom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. ""We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,"" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.

The discovery was ""distressing,"" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in ""severe stomach cramps and vomiting,"" she said. ""Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.""

Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was ""a gift,"" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help ""lots of other children.""

The risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.

Ellis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. ""It's been a huge success,"" her mother said.

The study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.

Not a cure

Dr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that ""it's not a cure.""

""It does not make the allergy to go away,"" Vickery said. ""The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.""

Still, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.

""I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,"" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.

How the study worked

To test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.

The treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is ""treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,"" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.

Ellis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.

""We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,"" Glover said. ""You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. ""

Three-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an ""exit food challenge"": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.

Two-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.

Overall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. ""It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,"" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, such as stomachache.

Ellis experienced stomach cramps and vomiting multiple times during the study, usually on days when her dose was increased to raise her tolerance. ""Having stomach cramps did not feel very good,"" she said. Still, she usually vomited, and the cramps passed quickly.

A little more than 11% of the children dropped out of the study due to severe side effects. Among children receiving the treatment, 10% required rescue epinephrine during the exit challenge, compared with 53% in the placebo group.

""These treatments really have the potential to transform people's lives,"" Vickery said, ""and I have seen it happen firsthand: the sense of relief [families] get when a child becomes desensitized.""

Trying to be 'bite safe'

Dr. Scott Sicherer, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said the study is ""the largest of the phase three studies in pharmaceutical-grade peanut.""

""It's what a lot of families call trying to be 'bite safe.' it's not that you're curing the allergy; it's not that you're going to be able to eat peanut butter sandwiches,"" said Sicherer, who was not involved in the study. ""It's really just to have a better threshold so that if you accidentally ate something that had a little bit of peanut in it, maybe you wouldn't have a reaction or the reaction wouldn't be so bad.""

Though the immunotherapy treatment is simply a matter of gradually increasing your tolerance to peanuts, you could have a severe reaction at home. ""This is not something to try at home,"" Sicherer said.

Aimmune has made peanut into a ""pharmaceutical-grade"" product, he said. ""Most people think of it as medicinalized food."" Doctors and patients both know exactly how much you're getting, he said, ""and that's important because if you're reactive to, say, a 50th of a peanut, you don't want to have a mistake where you're suddenly getting a 10th of peanut.""

Assuming the treatment wins FDA approval, Sicherer said, the conversation between doctors and patients will be, ""Is it better to just avoid the food and ask a lot of questions at restaurants and be real careful, or do something like this and still don't eat the food and ask the questions in the restaurant, but at least know you have a bit of a safety valve?""

There are more than a few caveats when it comes to the treatment regimen. For one, it's ""a commitment,"" he said. You cannot take a dose before exercising, and you can't skip doses, or you might have a severe reaction when you pick it up again.

Glover noted, ""It's somewhat disruptive. You have to do it every day. Generally, we would take it after dinner."" After giving the medicine, she added, parents must carefully monitor their children, preventing them from becoming too active or too hot.

Sicherer said, ""The family that does this really, really, really has to be a rule follower. It's not easy."" It would still be worth it to many, he said.

If this ends up being the first approved treatment, if it is covered by insurance and if details of whom it works for best were all worked out and the risks and benefits were clear, ""that would be so amazing, because we haven't really had anything like that before,"" he said.

""It's not everything we would hope for, but it's still fantastic to be able to raise someone's threshold from a teeny tiny amount of peanut to a couple of peanuts or more,"" said Sicherer, who believes that other allergy products will be developed in time: ""I can tell my patients that this might be the right thing for them, but if not, we're looking at things that might be easier and better down the road.""

Glover acknowledges that ""it's not a perfect solution. I would say it's been some work to go through this study, just in terms of a time commitment."" Still, if it had taken twice the amount of time, she would have done it: ""It's peace of mind.""

Even though she dislikes the medicine's taste, Ellis also believes it is worth it. ""It's definitely better,"" she would say to another kid with peanut allergy: ""You know you can be around your friends when they have peanut butter on them.""","Peanut allergy experimental treatment helps 2 out of 3 sufferers, study finds",5,CNN

While the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy, it has proven successful in building up patients’ tolerance to peanuts over time, lessening the potential for life-threatening complications.

“We’re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,” said allergist Stephen Tilles, MD, ACAAI former president, study co-author and consulting advisor for Aimmune Therapeutics, according to EurekAlert. “Our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. We were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment, and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts.”

The results, which were presented Sunday at the College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old. All participants, who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17, had a peanut allergy, but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time.

Participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC).

“Reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment,” Tilles said, according to EurekAlert. “On average, the participants were able to tolerate a 100-fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning. In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”

EXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA

With FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.

“This is not a quick fix, and it doesn’t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,” Jay Lieberman, MD, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee and study co-author, said, according to EurekAlert. “But it is definitely a breakthrough. The hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures.","Potential life-saving peanut allergy drug on horizon, scientists say",2,Fox News

(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s blockbuster drug Keytruda met the main goal of a late-stage trial testing the treatment in patients with cancers of the digestive tract, the U.S. drugmaker said on Wednesday.

Keytruda, among a class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors, is Merck’s top selling drug and has already been approved to treat several forms of cancer including skin and lung cancer.

PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors work by blocking a mechanism of tumors that allows them to evade detection by cancer-fighting cells.

Keytruda, when compared to chemotherapy, enabled certain patients with esophageal cancer to live longer, helping the drug meet the main goal of the late-stage study, Merck said.

“This marks the sixth tumor type where Keytruda has demonstrated a survival benefit, and represents the first time an anti-PD-1 therapy has achieved overall survival for this patient population,” said Roy Baynes, chief medical officer of Merck Research Laboratories.

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, the company said.

Merck said trial results would be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.",Merck drug Keytruda succeeds in late-stage esophageal cancer trial,1,Reuters
story_reviews_00013,"(CNN) A five-minute neck scan could predict a person's risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge, researchers have said.

The test, which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck, could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline, according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL), who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.

A group of almost 3,200 patients, aged 58-74, had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002, before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years, from 2002 to 2016.

People with the most intense pulses, which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow, were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions, the research found, because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain's network of blood vessels.

Pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down -- usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use -- and can no longer ""cushion"" the blood flow coming from the heart.

""If you can detect [the risk] in people in mid-life, it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle,"" said Dr. Scott Chiesa, post-doctoral researcher at UCL.

""What's good for the arteries is good for the brain,"" he added in summary of his findings. ""Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.""

If the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.

And the scans would be ""well set up for routine testing,"" according to Chiesa. ""It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.""

When healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.

But damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.

""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,"" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.

Vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.

Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.

Around 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization , with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050.

In the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.

'Promising findings'

The study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.

""Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,"" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.

But he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: ""The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.""

There is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.

""Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.""

Previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level , but its effects remain largely incurable.

More research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.

""While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,"" said Routledge.

Routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.",Dementia: Five-minute neck scan can spot symptoms earlier,2,CNN
story_reviews_00014,"Artificial intelligence can be used to spot Alzheimer's six years before a patient would normally be diagnosed, a study shows.

Doctors used the self-learning computer to detect changes in brain scans too subtle for humans to see.

The system was able to identify dementia in 40 patients an average of six years before they were formally diagnosed.

British AI expert Prof Noel Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield, said of the findings: ""This is exactly the sort of task that deep learning is cut out for - finding high-level patterns in data.

""Although the sample sizes and test sets were relatively small, the results are so promising that a much larger study would be worthwhile.""

Boffins from the University of California trained the computer using more than 2,100 scans from 1,002 patients.

The scans measure brain activity by tracking the uptake of a radioactive liquid injected into the blood.

Research has linked the development of Alzheimer's to particular changes in certain brain regions but these can be difficult to spot.

The Alzheimer's algorithm was able to teach itself to recognize patterns in brain scans that indicated disease.

As a final test, it was given a set of 40 scans from 40 patients it had never studied before.

It proved to be 100 percent accurate at detecting Alzheimer's disease many years before the patient was later diagnosed.

Dr Jae Ho Sohn, who worked on the project, said: ""We were very pleased with the algorithm's performance.

""It was able to predict every single case that advanced to Alzheimer's disease.""

Early detection of Alzheimer's could open the door to new ways of slowing down or even halting the progression of the disease.

Dr Carol Routledge, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The diseases that cause dementia begin in the brain up to 20 years before any symptoms start to show, presenting a vital window of opportunity for us to intervene before widespread damage occurs.

""This study highlights the potential of machine learning to assist with the early detection of diseases like Alzheimer's, but the findings will need to be confirmed in much larger groups of people before we can properly assess the power of this approach.""

CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.

Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their “unique” doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.

Chicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.

The price tag so far is about $3,000, but “it’s worth every dime and penny,” said the 36-year-old.

Pestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.

For now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.

Ketamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn’t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn’t as addictive and doesn’t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.

Its potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.

Conventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.

Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.

“We don’t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,” she said.

The strongest studies suggest it’s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.

“It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.

But to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.

Last year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said “major gaps” remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.

When delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.

“There are some very real concerns,” Sanacora said. “We do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.”

Dr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine’s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.

“He said, ‘Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,’” Khare recalled.

Khare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses.

There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley.

Khare said the burgeoning field “is like a new frontier” where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They’re typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said.

Typical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare’s office visit cost. Patients can receive “booster” treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved.

At a recent session, Pestikas’s seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK.

“No questions, just grateful,” Pestikas replied, smiling.

Pestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like “a controlled acid trip” with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks.

Studies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so.

Exactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health.

A small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain’s opioid receptors.

Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September.

Meanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there’s a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit.

Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed.

Interested in Flu Season? Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The medication, called XOFLUZA, was designed to make the flu shorter if taken within 48 hours of onset and can be prescribed to patients 12 and older once they've been diagnosed with the illness, according to the FDA.

The new medication is designed to significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms by more than one day, when compared to a placebo in clinical trials, the FDA said.

Researchers believe the medication will prevent patients from spreading the flu, which could help reign in contagion rates following the 2017-2018 flu season, which saw 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 deaths -- the deadliest season in four decades, according to the FDA. The medication was approved under a priority review.

The medication is the first in a new class of antiviral medications that blocks an enzyme within the flu virus, which stops viral replication early in the influenza cycle, the FDA announced.

XOFLUZA is similar to Oseltamivir, also known under the brand name Tamiflu, but ""decreases viral shedding faster"" and is associated with less side effects, Dr. Todd Ellerin, the infectious disease specialist at South Shore Hospital in Massachusetts, told ABC News.

""Like Tamiflu, it seems to work better the quicker it gets into the patient,"" Ellerin said.

In clinical trials, XOFLUZA demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of influenza, including Tamiflu-resistant strains, and has also proved effective against some strains of Asian bird flu, such as H5N1, according to the FDA.

The medication is the ""first new flu medicine"" of its kind -- with a novel proposed mechanism -- in nearly 20 years, said Dr. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Genentech, the company selling the pill in the U.S., in a statement to ABC News.

""If patients see their doctors within 48 hours of symptom onset, one dose of XOFLUZA can significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms,"" Horning said.

Since it was tested in healthy, adult patients, it is unclear how effective it will be in the most severe cases or for the most vulnerable patients, Ellerin said.

The Swiss drugmaker’s BYL719, a so-called PI3K inhibitor also known as alpelisib, combined with hormone therapy fulvestrant boosted median progression-free survival (PFS) to 11 months, up from 5.7 months for patients who got only hormone therapy, the company said on Saturday.

BYL719 plus fulvestrant cut risk of death or progression in those patients by an estimated 35 percent, Novartis said.

Novartis said earlier this year that this study, called SOLAR-1, of hormone receptor positive, HER2- breast cancer with mutations of the PIK3CA gene showed that YL719 helped patients.

But this specific benefit data is being released on Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology’s annual conference in Munich.

Even though PIK3CA mutations are the most common genetic change in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, trials of agents seeking to put a brake on this pathway to tumor growth have largely disappointed including on safety issues.

Other drugmakers including Roche have seen similar investigational medicines stumble, making Novartis’s progress here hopeful news, doctors involved in the trial said.

“The results of SOLAR-1 are the most encouraging observed to date from a trial evaluating a PI3K inhibitor” for patients with this kind of breast cancer, said Fabrice Andre, a professor at France’s Institut Gustave Roussy.

“These data have the potential to allow physicians to address an unmet need in this patient population by using a biomarker-driven treatment to inform their sequencing decisions,” Andre added.

Like other companies, Novartis is seeking to personalize treatment for cancer patients by using biomarkers like those showing PIK3CA gene mutations to help guide treatment.

TALKS WITH REGULATORS

This week, Novartis signed a deal to have Roche unit Foundation Medicine provide genomic profiling of patient samples taken from Novartis’ clinical oncology trials. Other cancer drugmakers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck also have Foundation deals.

Samit Hirawat, head of Novartis’s cancer drug development, said in an interview the side-effects profile of alpelisib held up.

“We don’t see as much diarrhea, we do not have CNS (central nervous system) side effects, we do not have the liver effects,” he said.

Novartis plans to file with regulators for approval of the drug this year, Hirawat said, adding he also has strategies to broaden the indication, including tough-to-treat triple-negative breast cancer.

“PIK3CA mutations are present in many other tumor types,” Hirawat said. “There is a larger program we are putting into place.”",Novartis drug cut death risk by 35 percent in gene mutation breast cancer,2,Reuters

HealthDay Reporter

THURSDAY, Oct. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In what researchers are calling a ""breakthrough,"" two preliminary trials have found that either of two triple-drug regimens could potentially benefit 90 percent of people with cystic fibrosis.

The trials were short-term, finding that the drug combinations improved adult patients' lung function over four weeks. But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.

What's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.

""This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,"" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. ""But it could be game-changing.""

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.

However, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

The most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.

About half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only ""modest,"" Rowe said.

Then there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a ""minimal-function"" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.

Both new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.

Rowe's team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.

Rowe's team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.

After four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a ""pronounced improvement.""

The other trial had nearly identical results.

This is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has ""pushed the needle"" for patients with one F508del mutation.

An editorial published with the studies said they ""represent a major breakthrough.""

Now the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.

""The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,"" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. ""This is very exciting news for our community.""

Rowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens. One is, how well do they work for younger patients?

Patients as young as 12 are included in the larger ongoing trials, Rowe said.

So far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were ""mild to moderate,"" the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.

TUESDAY, Oct. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating a specific set of nerves that are nestled along the spine may deliver relief to those who suffer from chronic back pain and cut the need for opioid painkillers, new research suggests.

The therapy, which targets the root ganglion nerves, is more effective than other spine stimulation procedures because it places tiny leads precisely at the area where pain originates, unlike other devices that provide more generalized stimulation, the researchers said.

""In certain patients who have not gotten relief from other treatments, this therapy may give sustained pain relief and may allow them to reduce opioids for at least 18 months and perhaps longer,"" said lead researcher Robert McCarthy. He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

The dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.

A pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.

The pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.

In addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.

The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.

Before receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.

In addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.

The procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.

McCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.

Also, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.

For uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.

Spine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.

McCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.

One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.

""The results of this study are very significant,"" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.

""In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,"" Patel said.

""I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,"" she said.

The findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

SUNDAY, Sept. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- It's a perfect case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

A potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer, a small, preliminary study reports.

The bacteria, Clostridium novyi-NT, can cause gas gangrene and sepsis if infection is allowed to run amok in a wound.

But when injected into a tumor, Clostridium novyi-NT appears to both attack the cancer directly and encourage the body's immune response against the cancer cells, said lead researcher Dr. Filip Janku. He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.

""Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,"" Janku said.

Clostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.

The strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for ""non-toxic.""

Clostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.

""Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,"" Janku explained. ""Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.""

To test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.

Fifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.

The scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.

First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.

""If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,"" Janku said. ""It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.""

The bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.

Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.

""Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,"" Janku noted.

The bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.

Tumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.

Following bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.

The potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.

""That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,"" Gnjatic said. ""What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.""

Janku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.

""Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,"" Janku explained.

Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.

However, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.

Two patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.

Researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.

""That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,"" Janku said.

Patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.

The trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.

Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Vitamin D is most commonly associated with the development and maintenance of strong bones as the body needs it to absorb calcium. But recently emerging research suggests vitamin D deficiency could also be a contributing factor of obesity.

The World Health Organization describes childhood obesity as one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century, with an estimated 41 million children under the age of five falling into this category. Obesity puts children at greater risk of developing preventable conditions like heart disease and diabetes at a younger age, and suffering poor health later in life.

In what is believed to be the first study to investigate the links between vitamin D supplementation and the weight and health of obese children and adolescents, researchers from University of Athens Medical School and Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, recruited 232 particpants.

The team measured participants' vitamin D levels, body fat percentage, as well as their markers of liver and heart function at the start of the study, and again 12 months later.

The researchers randomly assigned 117 children with supplements containing 50,000 IU vitamin D for six weeks, while the others acted as the control group.

Children who took vitamin D had a significantly lower BMI, the researchers found. They also had lower body fat, as well as healthier cholesterol levels.

Dr. Evangelia, associate professor pediatric and adolescent endocrinology at at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and lead author of the study, said: ""These findings suggest that simple vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of overweight and obese children developing serious heart and metabolic complications in later life.”

The findings are set to be presented at the 57th Annual European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology Meeting, and have therefore not yet been reviewed.

In their next investigation, the team will study whether vitamin D supplements can improve the health of obese children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with disorders linked to obesity, such as high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and high blood pressure.

""Although these initial findings indicate that vitamin D could be used in the treatment of obesity, there remains a lack of evidence on the safety and long-term effects of supplementation, particularly if there is no vitamin D deficiency,” said Charmandari. ""However, if your child is overweight or obese I recommend that you consult your primary care physician for advice, and consider having their vitamin D levels tested.""

Professor Mary Fewtrell, assistant officer for health promotion at the U.K.-based Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, told Newsweek: ""Although the effect sizes are not given, these outcomes are certainly positive. It's encouraging that a simple intervention could have these effects and this certainly merits further investigation to consider its potential impacts on vitamin D supplementation for children with obesity.""

Earlier this year, researchers in the Netherlands published a study indicating higher levels of belly fat are linked to lower vitamin D levels.

According to findings presented at the European Society of Endocrinology annual meeting in Barcelona, individuals with higher levels of total body and abdominal fat appeared to have lower levels of vitamin D.

Rachida Rafiq, the lead author of the study told Newsweek at the time: ""Our results are significant as vitamin D deficiency and obesity are very common problems in our society nowadays,"" she told Newsweek, and argued that it is an important potential relationship to explore.

story_reviews_00027,"(Reuters Health) - People struggling with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might feel better with antidepressants or psychotherapy, a recent study suggests.

People with IBS typically suffer from chronic abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea and constipation. While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn’t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.

For the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or “usual management” in people with IBS.

Rates of “no relief” were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.

“One component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,” said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the current study.

“Since there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,” Camilleri said by email.

Psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Although the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.

One limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms.

Still, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study.

Antidepressants may work better for certain types of IBS, and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter, Kulak-Bejda said by email.

A family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found. But another family of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was better than a placebo for easing symptoms like pain and bloating and improving quality of life.

“The decision to use antidepressants as a form of therapy should be taken individually,” Kulak-Bejda said. “The decision should be made after considering all the pros and cons.”

Lead author Dr. Alexander Ford of the University of Leeds in the U.K. didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A vicious cycle ensues: The heart enlarges, so the mitral valve leaks. The leaky mitral valve makes the heart enlarge even more, as it tries to compensate, and heart failure worsens.

In the new study, a device called the MitraClip was used to repair the mitral valve by clipping its two flaps together in the middle. (The clip is made by Abbott, which funded the study; outside experts reviewed the trial data.)

The result was to convert a valve that barely functioned into one able to regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.

Until today, researchers were not sure that fixing the mitral valve would do much to help these patients. A smaller study in France with similar patients failed to find a benefit for the MitraClip.

But that research included many patients with less severe valve problems, the procedure was not performed as adeptly, and the patients’ medications were not as well optimized as in the new study.

Researchers used a vaccine against the mosquito-borne virus to kill human glioblastoma brain cells which had been implanted into rodents.

Glioblastoma is the most common and fastest growing form of astrocytoma; tumors which start in the glial cells of the brain.

Currently, most people diagnosed with the condition die within two years. Doctors can try to treat glioblastoma with surgery to remove the cancerous cells, and blast them with radiation and chemotherapy. However, as the disease spreads, it becomes difficult to differentiate healthy brain cells from cancerous glioblastoma stem cells, and the condition is therefore almost impossible to completely remove.

“Thus, development of an effective therapy to kill glioblastoma stem cells is urgently needed,” Dr. Pei-Yong Shi, professor of genetics at the University of Texas Medical Branch and author of the study published in the journal mBio told Newsweek.

As both the Zika virus and glioblastoma can affect the brain, the team hypothesized that the former could be harnessed to treat the latter.

In 2015, countries in the Americas, including Brazil, as well as parts of Africa, were hit by a public health crisis following outbreaks of Zika and its link to encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes swollen.

The majority of Zika cases result in a mild fever, rash, aches and pains, conjunctivitis and a headache. But if a pregnant woman becomes infected, the virus can target neural progenitor cells in her fetus, putting the infant at risk of being born with microcephaly. This is where the head develops smaller than normal.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The study showed that a live-attenuated Zika vaccine (containing a weakened version of the virus that does not cause disease in humans) could selectively infect and kill human glioblastoma stem cells, explained Shi. That’s because glioblastoma stem cells have similar properties to neural stem cells.

To investigate whether ZIKV-LAV, a vaccine developed at the University of Texas shown to protect mice and non-human primates against the virus, could kill human glioblastoma stem cells, the scientists injected a combination of glioblastoma stem cells from two human donors and the vaccine into mice.

The animals dosed only with the stem cells developed tumors. But those injected with the combination lived to around 50 days, 20 days longer than the stem cell mice.

When the team sequenced the RNA (a molecule that helps with gene expressions) of glioblastoma stem cells exposed to the vaccine and then those which weren’t, they found the virus prompted an antiviral reaction in the exposed cells in what is known as an oncolytic response.

Before undergoing surgery, cancer patients could be given the Zika vaccine to ""let the viruses hunt down the GSCs [glioblastoma stem cells] and eliminate them,” said virologist Dr. Cheng-Feng Qin of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, who worked on the study.

Shi said: “Scientists may turn the 'bad' side of a devastating pathogen—Zika virus—for potential cancer therapy.”

However, he cautioned any potential treatment which could emerge from the study is far from being rolled out.

“We still need to further improve the specificity of the cancer-killing ability, while retain the safety of the vaccine strain,” Shi explained. “For example, we need to make sure that the therapeutic vaccine virus does not infect and kill normal neurons in humans.”

Dr. Harry Bulstrode, brain tumor expert funded by the charity Cancer Research U.K. who is researching how Zika could be used to treat aggressive brain tumors, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek: ""This study is another interesting piece in the jigsaw, but it is never going to demonstrate what we believe to be the really exciting properties of the virus. These are its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and to selectively infect and concentrate in the brain tumor stem cells left behind after surgery.""",Glioblastoma: Zika Virus Could Destroy Brain Cancer That Killed John McCain,4,Newsweek

Two studies published recently in the journals Frontiers in Pharmacology and Medicine found that patients with health conditions such as chronic pain and insomnia saw ""statistically and clinically significant therapeutic benefits"" when they used medical cannabis, according to a press release from the University of New Mexico.

Researchers from the university studied data obtained through the Releaf App. This app, developed by several of the studies' authors, is ""the largest repository of user-entered information on the consumption and effect of cannabis use in the United States,"" the release states. It has almost 100,000 entries.

The app is designed to record how using marijuana corresponds to changes in the intensity of symptoms and any side effects a person experiences. It helps ""track and learn which types of cannabis, dosing and ingestion methods work best.""

The study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology found that users suffering from 27 different health conditions with symptoms ranging from seizures to depression reported a mean reduction in symptoms of 2.8 to 4.6 points on a zero to 10 point scale after consuming cannabis in various forms, including concentrates and topicals. People using the drug to treat anxiety- and depression-related symptoms reported more relief than people with pain symptoms.

In the second study, researchers examined how cannabis buds treated insomnia. Cannabis users on the Releaf App experienced a reduction of symptom severity of an average 4.5 points on a zero to 10 point scale. According to the study, people who consumed the drug via pipes and vaporizers experienced greater relief of symptoms, and those who vaped experienced fewer negative effects.

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Taking fish oil supplements during pregnancy might translate into healthier growth in children during their first six years of life, a new study suggests.

""This study highlights the fact that in utero exposure can have a profound effect on the fetus that lasts through childhood,"" said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""For the past decade, the importance of fish oil and the omega-3 fatty acids have been stressed to patients,"" explained Wu, who was not involved in the study.

""The use of fish oil in the latter part of the pregnancy has an impact on bone and muscle mass. Though these children are larger, they do not have increased rates of obesity,"" Wu added.

In the study, the researchers followed 736 pregnant women in Denmark who took either fish oil or olive oil supplements daily from week 24 of their pregnancy until one week after they gave birth.

The children were assessed 11 times between birth and the age of 6 years. Those whose mothers took the fish oil supplements during pregnancy sustained a higher body mass index (BMI) from the age of 1 to 6 years.

However, the higher BMI was not due to a higher percentage of fat, but rather to higher percentages of lean muscle and bone mass, the researchers found.

At age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements while pregnant had a 395 grams higher total mass, 281 grams higher lean mass and 10 grams higher bone mineral content than children whose mothers who took olive oil during pregnancy, the findings showed.

""The body composition at age 6 years in children given fish oil supplementation was characterized by a proportional increase in lean, bone and fat mass, suggesting a general growth-stimulating effect,"" the researchers, who were led by Hans Bisgaard, from the University of Copenhagen, wrote in the report.

However, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children.

According to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., ""In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature.""

But Rabin, who was not involved in the study, did add a few caveats about the findings.

The population studied was relatively homogenous, and ""the [body mass] findings were not the object of the study (wheezing or asthma in children was the primary objective), growth was a secondary finding,"" Rabin explained. ""Certainly, however, this solid paper adds to the literature and paves the way for additional research on this interesting topic.""

The report by Bisgaard and colleagues was published online Sept. 4 in the BMJ.

Researchers examined participants who were experiencing psychotic symptoms, but had not yet been diagnosed with psychosis, as well as healthy patients. Some subjects with symptoms were given placebo, while others received a single dose of CBD. All the participants then underwent an MRI scan while performing a memory task that engages regions of the brain related to psychosis, a press release stated.

Results from the MRI scans showed that participants displaying psychotic symptoms had abnormal brain activity compared to healthy participants. However, those that had received cannabidiol showed decreased abnormal activity compared to those who received the placebo. These results suggest that CBD can help re-adjust brain function to normal levels.

The researchers aren't entirely sure how CBD works in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms, but the results show that it has a therapeutic effect, according to the press release.

""The mainstay of current treatment for people with psychosis are drugs that were first discovered in the 1950s and unfortunately do not work for everyone,"" Sagnik Bhattacharyya, co-author of the study said in the release. ""Our results have started unravelling the brain mechanisms of a new drug that works in a completely different way to traditional antipsychotics.""

A previous King's College London study also discovered that the chemical has antipsychotic effects, and in June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first medication made from cannabidiol to treat two rare forms of epilepsy.",Cannabidiol Reduces Symptoms of Psychosis,2,U.S. News & World Report
story_reviews_00037,"“Let’s talk about your test results,” my neurologist said.

She looked as if she had good news. Instead, it was shocking.

The carotid artery on the left side of my neck, one of the brain’s two main sources of blood and oxygen, was clogged with fatty plaque, the doctor said. The artery was almost completely blocked.

There must be a mistake, I thought frantically. I exercise and am healthy and young. Actually, I’m 68, but, you know, a young 68. You are in danger of a major stroke, she said, and need an operation. Immediately.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. As a journalist covering the medical field, I have spent years writing about strokes, most of which are caused by clots blocking blood flow to the brain. Now I faced the unnerving question: Am I going to become a weird punch line? As in: Did you see that the guy who writes all those stories about strokes just had a big one?

A blocked carotid artery didn’t seem possible for an active person like me. I’ve never smoked. I’ve run, lifted weights or done something aerobic like playing tennis pretty much every day of my life. I watch what I eat. I even wrote an article about how I kept my bad cholesterol in check with diet and exercise, not medication.

While I’m addicted to cheese, and my weight has climbed some, I’ve eaten foods like salmon and oatmeal with fervor for more than 20 years. So I figured I was exempt from medical crises.

The diagnosis made me reconsider dilemmas that had once seemed academic. For example, should older Americans be screened for blocked carotid arteries?

Critical Paths The carotid arteries are passageways through which blood and oxygen move to a person's brain and face. When fatty plaque obstructs an artery, the blood supply can be reduced or cut off, sometimes resulting in a stroke.

Clots cause about 700,000 strokes that lead to 130,000 deaths annually in the U.S. and are the primary preventable cause of disability, according to the American Stroke Association. Carotid disease is a main cause of those strokes—nearly 200,000 strokes a year, vascular specialists say. Yet 80% of those patients have no symptoms before the strokes.

In 2014, a U.S. task force concluded that people with no symptoms don’t have to be screened for carotid disease, saying that the risks, such as poor surgery, “outweigh the benefits.” But the task force—a panel of private doctors assigned by law to help set U.S. medical policy—focused on screening in the general population, not older patients.

The task force said there aren’t enough carotid-caused strokes to warrant screening everyone. Of course, not everyone with carotid blockage will get surgery; thousands of people with the condition can benefit from drug therapy.

My experience, along with some evidence from screening of thousands of individuals, raises questions about the task force’s conclusions. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends screening people over 65 with coronary disease, high blood pressure or a history of smoking.

The task force generally supports screening Americans for breast cancer, with 253,000 new cases in women and 41,000 estimated deaths annually, as well as colorectal cancer, with 135,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths a year. Government and private insurance pay to screen for these illnesses, but not for carotid screening of non-symptomatic people, which can cost about $70 a person.

After hearing the jarring news about my dangerously blocked carotid, I faced a big decision. My wife Christa and I live near Washington, D.C. Our daughter, Maddie, was supposed to be married in San Francisco in June, a week after the neurologist told me I needed surgery right away. Suddenly the prospect of being at the wedding seemed iffy.

Conventional wisdom says that among the 65-and-older set, only those with symptoms should be tested. That often means individuals who have had mini-strokes, which tend to be brief periods in which the patient has something wrong on one side of the body, usually for a few minutes. Symptoms often include slurred speech, temporary vision loss, a one-sided facial droop and arm or leg weakness or numbness.

Vascular surgeon George Lavenson Jr. wrote in 2012 in the Journal for Vascular Ultrasound that among 22,146 people screened for carotid disease during four public screening campaigns between 2001 and 2006, about 7.5% were found to have blockage of 60% or more—enough to warrant treatment with medication.

“It is hard to understand how many leaders in the medical profession can object to a one- to two-minute accurate screen of seniors that can find the 7.5% with silent carotid artery disease,” Dr. Lavenson said. Those patients can be “evaluated and managed to prevent them from being one of the 700,000 clot-caused strokes we continue to have annually.”

Most doctors would have put me in the asymptomatic, or less-risky, category. But five years ago, I went out for a run of about 7 miles along the Potomac River. At the end of the run, my right leg started shaking. That seldom happened again until the past few months, when it started recurring more often, along with shaking in the right arm.

My physician, Joel Taubin, recommended a neurologist, Rhanni Herzfeld, of the Neurology Center in Washington. She prescribed tests to discern the cause of the shaking, perhaps a pinched nerve, incipient epilepsy, a neurological disorder or a tumor. The results ruled them all out.

Then an MRI of my head showed a few white spots on the left side. Dr. Herzfeld wondered if I might have had some “silent strokes,” sending tiny bits of artery plaque floating to my brain—and now appearing as white spots on the scan. Fatty plaque accumulates in most people’s arteries, and can form clots that break off and can cause strokes.

Dr. Herzfeld ordered a carotid ultrasound of the arteries on both sides of my neck. It’s a quick, painless and very accurate scan. Moments later, we were talking in her office. My right carotid artery was perfectly clear, she said. The left was almost completely blocked and I needed immediate surgery to clear it.

I asked if we could treat the obstruction with anti-platelet medication, such as Plavix.

“No, your blockage is just too extensive,” Dr. Herzfeld said. She recommended that Bruce A. Perler, a professor of vascular surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, do the procedure.

The effectiveness of carotid-artery surgery in people without symptoms—but major blockage—was established two decades ago by the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health. It showed, in hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, that the risk of stroke or death in surgery patients after a median 2.7 years was 5.1%, less than half that of people treated only with drugs. An international study published in 2010 in the Lancet showed similar benefits from surgery.

I consulted with other doctors, including one who said, “This isn’t quite an emergency, but it’s urgent.”

The operation is serious, with the rates of stroke and death within 30 days after surgery totaling about 2.4% in major studies examined by the task force. The task force noted that this typical measure can be as high as 5% at some low-volume hospitals.

People considering this operation should ask their hospital, surgeon or academic medical center about their rates of stroke and death after surgery. Few hospitals and surgeons in the U.S. publish their individual results. Dr. Perler’s rate was well under 1%. He said my risk of stroke was 10% to 15% over five years, probably in the first year.

A week before Maddie’s wedding, my wife and I met with Dr. Perler at Johns Hopkins. On the drive to Baltimore, we called Maddie. She sounded frightened and I told her maybe I wouldn’t need surgery—or could put it off. We also told her brothers, Jamie and Will, and her sister, Samantha, what was going on.

Dr. Perler’s test confirmed Dr. Herzfeld’s findings: I definitely needed surgery. My artery was almost completely obstructed by “echolucent” plaque—a type that can easily form clots, break off and cause strokes.

We discussed timing. Dr. Perler’s next surgery day was June 18. That would leave me four days to recover before the wedding. He warned that I would be “miserable” doing that. But his next surgery day after that wasn’t until June 27.

“You can safely wait until next week,” he said, “but I wouldn’t wait two months.” Then he added the words I remember most: “We’ll take good care of you.”

My wife and I decided on June 27—and headed to San Francisco for the wedding. It was an untraditional ceremony with no white veil or a parade of bridesmaids. Maddie wore a champagne-colored, beaded dress. I have never seen her so happy—except maybe when she was playing My Little Pony as a 6-year-old. I was simply happy to be there.

On the morning of June 27, Dr. Perler started operating at 7:30. Within two hours, he had cleared the plaque from my carotid artery. Later, he told me it was so clogged—about 99%—he couldn’t even detect a pulse in it.

When I woke up, I was relieved to see that my eyes and fingers all worked. I could think and speak clearly. I was even able to complain to the nurses about how lousy I felt.

I spent two days in intensive care, with my blood pressure surging at times. About two weeks after the operation, I felt pretty normal. I’ve resumed running and weight-lifting. I recently played golf for the first time since the surgery and feel great.

But mostly I feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life.

Getting Screened A national company, Life Line Screening, will do a carotid screen for $70, or with other tests such as for aortic aneurysms, for $149.

Hospitals’ accredited labs will do carotid ultrasound tests typically for $200 to $300, but usually only on a doctor’s order.

Insurers, private and government, generally will pay only if the patient has symptoms, including a mini-stroke.

The Society for Vascular Surgery’s site, vascular.org, can direct people to specialists who can do testing.

The procedure is noninvasive and doesn't require anesthesia, and the pulses are delivered via an electromagnetic device or coil that is placed or worn on the head.

The Food and Drug Administration made the announcement on Friday, expanding the use of a technology that has been around for decades. The FDA first approved TMS devices for major depression in 2008, and in 2013 they were approved to treat pain associated with some types of migraine headaches.

The approval was based on a clinical trial of 100 people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, where roughly half received treatment with TMS and the other half had a sham treatment that didn't deliver the electromagnetic pulses. People who were taking medication for OCD continued to do so for the trial.

Overall, 38% of the people with the real device responded to the treatment compared with 11% of those with the sham device.

story_reviews_00039,"Scientists say they have created a new drug that can attack ovarian and lung cancers in patients for whom other treatments have failed.

The U.K.-based researchers used a new drug along with chemotherapy medication known as paclitaxel on 25 women with high-grade, serous ovarian cancer, and 40 participants with squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The cancers had spread across the bodies of each participant, who did not respond to standard treatment.

Over half of patients with ovarian cancer and over a third with lung cancer saw their tumors shrink, according to the study, which was published in the Annals of Oncology.

The cocktail also stopped the cancer growing for almost six months, which is unexpected for patients with advanced-stage cancers who were unresponsive to currently available treatments, including chemotherapy, the authors said.

The research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, as well as teams in nine institutions across the U.K.

It built on previous research by the ICR that showed ovarian cancer cells resistant to treatment generally have higher levels of a molecule called p-S6K, which aids the growth of the disease. The scientists hypothesized the cancer could use this molecule to render chemotherapy ineffective.

Vistusertib attacks proteins called mTOR1 and 2, which turn on the p-S6K protein. Combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy, the scientists were able to block cancer cells from harnessing p-S6K. That is why the patients’ tumors shrunk, the study suggests.

Dr. Susana Banerjee, consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and team leader in gynecological cancers at ICR, who is leading the phase II trial, commented in a statement: “Effective treatment options for women with relapsed ovarian cancer are limited, so these results are very encouraging.

Commenting on the next stage of the research, she said: “In the larger phase II trial we’ve recruited 140 women with relapsed ovarian cancer across the U.K. to standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or paclitaxel in combination with vistusertib. We need to wait for these results, expected later this year, to see how effective this approach is compared to chemotherapy alone.”

Dr. Dean A. Fennell, professor and consultant in thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek the study presents an “exciting result.”

He was particularly surprised by the magnitude of the response triggered by vistusertib combined with paclitaxel, which is closely related to standard chemotherapy.

However, Fennell said the study tripped up in that there was no predictive link between mutations and response to treatment. “In other words, there was no sign of who might benefit the most with treatment,"" he explained.

He continued: “This combination of vistusertib and paclitaxel appears promising in lung cancer.

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For women with advanced breast cancer who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, an experimental drug could improve survival, a new study suggests.

The BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.

In a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.

""For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

When it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.

PARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.

In addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors ""to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,"" Litton said.

The trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.

Similar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.

In the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.

The drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy.

In addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy.

Oncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. ""Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,"" she said.

This targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.

Normal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said.

""Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,"" she said.

Weiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing.

""In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,"" she said.

The trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The app, Natural Cycles, calculates when a woman is most likely to be fertile using their daily body temperature data and their menstrual cycle information.

The app then tells users what days they are more likely to be fertile and should abstain from sex or use protection if they do not wish to get pregnant.

""Consumers are increasingly using digital health technologies to inform their everyday health decisions, and this new app can provide an effective method of contraception if it’s used carefully and correctly,"" Dr. Terri Cornelison, the assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

""But women should know that no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device,"" she added.

The app had a ""perfect use"" failure rate of 1.8 percent in clinical studies that involved more than 15,500 women, or a ""typical use"" failure rate of 6.5 percent, according to the FDA. The ""typical use"" failure rate took into account women who sometimes did not use the app correctly or may have had unprotected sex on a day when the app flagged that they were fertile.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

Natural Cycles has, however, courted controversy in Europe, as some women have reported unwanted pregnancies while using the app as their main form of birth control.

Sweden's public broadcasting company SVT reported that 37 out of 668 women who received an abortion at a Stockholm hospital from September 2017 to the end of December 2017 were using the app and still had an unwanted pregnancy.

ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton emphasized that no method of contraception is perfect except abstinence, so it's not completely surprising that women have still gotten pregnant while using it.

Ashton added that apps can be useful in that they enourage women to be aware of their bodies' monthly changes. If a woman does decide to use an app for birth control, however, she needs to have a plan for what she would do if she does have an unplanned pregnancy.

Most contraception pills have a ""typical use"" failure rate of approximately 9 percent, according to Ashton, which is actually higher than the rate of the app, the FDA's data showed.

TUESDAY, Aug. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Dialysis patients waiting for kidney transplants might safely accept an organ from a donor infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a new study finds.

Using hepatitis C-infected kidneys would expand the organ pool and save lives, said lead researcher Dr. Peter Reese. He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.

""There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,"" he explained. ""Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.""

But these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.

Of roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.

New, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.

In a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.

""And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,"" Reese said.

The potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Though some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.

The report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Dr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.

Sharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.

""We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,"" he said.

Sharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent ""a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.""

But the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.

Another study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.

Sharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.

""Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,"" he said.

story_reviews_00045,"Young people suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) showed a significant reduction of their symptoms after being administered ketamine injections, according to a study published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology.

Researchers from the University of Minnesota and non-profit The Mayo Clinic found that ketamine caused an average decrease of 42% on the Children’s Depression Rating Scale (CDRS)—the most widely used rating scale in research trials for assessing the severity of depression and change in depressive symptoms among adolescents.

Ketamine is perhaps best known for being a popular recreational drug and a useful medical anesthetic, but an increasing body of research is showing that the compound coulde be an effective treatment for depression. Several recent studies have shown that even a single dose in adults can lead to rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. However, relatively little research has been conducted into ketamine's antidepressant effects in adolescents.

“Adolescence is a key time period for emergence of depression and represents an opportune and critical developmental window for intervention to prevent negative outcomes,” the authors wrote in the study.

“Unfortunately, about 40% of adolescents do not respond to their first intervention and only half of non-responders respond to the second treatment,” they said. “Because standard interventions require prolonged periods (e.g., weeks to months) to assess efficacy, serial treatment failures allow illness progression, which in turn worsens the outcome. Hence, novel treatment strategies to address treatment-resistant depression in adolescents are urgently needed.”

The latest study involved thirteen young people aged between 12 and 18 years of age who had failed two previous trials of anti-depressants. Over two weeks the researchers gave them six ketamine infusions.

They found that the treatment was well tolerated, with the participants showing an average decrease in CDRS scores of 42.5%. Five of the participants met the criteria for clinical response and remission. Of these, three were still in remission after 6-weeks, while the remaining two relapsed within two weeks.

According to the scientists, the results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results.

""The field is excited about a potential new agent for adolescents with treatment resistant depression,” Harold S. Koplewicz, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology said in a statement. “We look forward to additional studies of ketamine to validate this treatment.”

Questions also remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment, so more information will be needed before broader clinical use.

James Stone, a Clinical Senior Lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is ""a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed.""

""Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don’t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing,"" Stone added. ""Further studies are needed to address these questions.""",Ketamine Shows Promise As Treatment for Adolescents With Depression,3,Newsweek
story_reviews_00046,"Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, with more than 300 million people suffering from this mental illness, according to the World Health Organization.

Despite how common depression is, scientists still have a lot to learn about it.

Among what is known is that depression is not a single disease but a variety of feelings and behaviors that may have different underlying causes.

“Depressive disorders can present differently in different people. What is known now is that depression affects not just the brain but the whole organism,”said Natalie Rasgon, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.

But a new study of which Rasgon is a senior author finds evidence of a possible biomarker for major depressive disorder, which could lead to better treatments for this sometimes crippling disease.

The study by a group of researchers from around the U.S. and in Sweden finds that a specific, naturally-occurring chemical, called acetyl-L-carnitine, or LAC, is lower in the blood of people suffering from depression. The research was published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Previous animal studies convincingly showed the role of LAC in models of depression. This study is the first confirmation of the results from animal studies in human subjects with depression,” Rasgon told ABC News.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

Levels of the chemical were lower among people with more severe depression

Researchers measured LAC levels in the blood of 116 participants, and found that those with depression had significantly lower levels of the chemical than healthy individuals. Two groups of people at two different hospitals were examined, with the same results.

LAC levels were especially low among people whose depression was more severe, who began suffering from the disease at an earlier age or who had a history of childhood trauma. Levels were lowest among females whose depression did not get better with medications or therapy, known as “treatment-resistant depression,” and who had suffered childhood trauma or neglect.

The human body naturally produces LAC from a nutrient called carnitine, but researchers found that carnitine levels were the same in people with and without depression. This suggests that differing levels of LAC can be attributed to depression and not to diet.

What do we know about this chemical?

LAC performs a number of important tasks, including regulating how the brain and nervous system use energy. It also can interact with DNA to change how certain genes are expressed.

In previous studies, LAC has been shown to effectively and rapidly improve symptoms of depression in mice.

A review of multiple studies published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Medicine in 2017 showed that acetyl-L-carnitine may be better than a placebo in treating depression and may be as effective as common antidepressants but with fewer side effects. The review authors noted the studies were very small and larger trials are necessary to confirm any benefit.

There is a LAC supplement that has been used for dementia, but a 2003 review from Cochrane found it is unlikely to be of benefit for this purpose. Some studies suggest a benefit for a type of nerve pain called neuropathy.

But it is important to note this study did not test if LAC can be used for the treatment of depression.

“We are at the very beginning of this discovery and can’t recommend people to buy this supplement at the GNC store,” warned Rasgon.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

How further research might lead to possible treatments

LAC has potential to be a biomarker, something measurable in the body that reflects the presence of a disease. As such, it could potentially be used to screen for and diagnose severe or treatment-resistant depression and allow for earlier and more aggressive treatment.

Researchers hope future studies could shed light on whether physical activity, dietary habits, and sleep may affect LAC levels.

This study also found that people on antidepressant drugs still had lower levels of LAC in their blood, suggesting that taking supplements of the chemical might be helpful or possibly even necessary to fully benefit from a medication.

This research, together with prior studies, suggests that correcting a deficiency in LAC could be a step toward more targeted treatments of depression, especially for those who suffered childhood trauma or began having depression at an early age.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

“We are excited with these results and are working on extending them to further understand the role of LAC in patients receiving treatment for depression,”Rasgon said. “It is one of the pieces of a very large puzzle that constitutes depressive disorders as an illness.”

While this study has important implications in understanding depression, Rasgon cautioned that it requires larger studies to confirm the findings. “There are many questions to be answered – who will ultimately benefit from taking this supplement, what is the right dose, what is the appropriate duration of use.”

The study was a collaboration between researchers at Stanford, Rockefeller University, Duke University, Weill Cornell Medical College, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.

story_reviews_00047,"When actress and author Lena Dunham went public about having endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus, she wanted to make something clear: The pain it causes can be completely debilitating, and women desperately need better treatments.

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham who suffer from endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. An effective treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it’s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa) from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.

“This [medication] could really be transformative,” said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN doctor at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug. “I’m very excited to be able to start using it in my patients.”

Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed.

Every month, a woman’s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she’s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus — on the fallopian tubes, even in the nose, the lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can’t go through the vagina since it’s not growing in the uterus) it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.

There’s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don’t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest surgery to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries, and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)

Enter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, involving 1,200 women, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain.

The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were pretty remarkable. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug — and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.

“It’s a major advance,” said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, “and another option women have that’s effective.”

Now, the less good news: The drug won’t cure endometriosis — it’ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Researchers have also found it causes bone loss, and they have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year. It’ll also cost women $850 per month if they don’t have insurance coverage. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here’s why.

Endometriosis is incredibly common — but it can go undiagnosed for years

The three main ways endometriosis manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:

Pain before and during periods

Pain during sex

Infertility

Fatigue

Painful urination during periods

Painful bowel movements during periods

But many women don’t know they have endometriosis. It’s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.

Doctors aren’t sure why some women get it

Adding to the mystery around endometriosis: no one knows exactly what causes endometriosis, but doctors have some theories.

Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.

Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman’s ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis. Environmental factors: There’s some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one’s risk of developing endometriosis.

The treatments available don’t always help — and some have severe side effects

When birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, that can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or a Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth.

The new drug elagolix is not risk free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater decreases in bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn’t entirely surprising.

Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flushes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses — 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily — and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.)

But, DePaolo pointed out, “[Elagolix] doesn’t have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have.” That’s because, he said, it doesn’t drive down estrogen levels as severely.

So women with endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain or menopausal symptoms, including bone loss. “The game changer would be something that really improves the pain permanently,” DePaolo said. “This doesn’t do that — but it is effective while it’s given.” For some women, though, that may be a game changer in and of itself.",Women with endometriosis experience terrible pain. There’s finally a new treatment.,4,Vox

TUESDAY, July 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The active ingredient in pot that gets you high can calm agitation in people with advanced Alzheimer's disease, a small new study suggests.

Canadian researchers found that a form of synthetic THC significantly decreased agitation in a small group of Alzheimer's patients, working even better than the drugs now used.

""This is the first clinical trial to show that a cannabinoid can decrease agitation,"" said lead researcher Krista Lanctot, a senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto.

However, many study patients suffered from sedation due to the drug, noted Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association.

""We would love to see this study done in a larger group of people, to see if it continues to be effective in a larger group, and how worried we need to be about this sedation side effect,"" Fargo said.

Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants.

Agitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others.

""You're going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It's actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they're associated with an increase in mortality.""

The off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer's are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die.

But Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer's enters its advanced stages.

""We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It's also used for pain.""

The synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form.

""It's a milder form of TCH"" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. ""We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects.""

During the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo.

""We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,"" Lanctot said.

Patients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot.

These benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed.

Lanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer's provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering.

""This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It's not THC, and it's certainly not whole-plant marijuana,"" Fargo said. ""There's virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it's effective or safe in people with Alzheimer's disease.""

A form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said. It's used as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an anti-nausea remedy for chemotherapy patients.

Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol.

""We wouldn't want to change clinical practice based on one study,"" Lanctot added.

The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago. Research presented at medical meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00049,"(CNN) Australian researchers have developed an experimental blood test they say is the first blood test capable of detecting melanoma -- an aggressive form of skin cancer -- in its early stages with a high degree of accuracy.

The test could speed up the diagnosis process, saving thousands of lives.

Scientists at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia tested blood samples for the antibodies typically created by the immune system in response to melanoma and identified them with significant accuracy.

Antibodies ""are easily accessible in the blood, so it provides a fantastic test to identify an early-stage cancer,"" said project lead Professor Mel Ziman, leader of the university's Melanoma Research Group on Monday.

In the study , published Tuesday in the journal Oncotarget, Ziman's team screened 245 blood samples from both melanoma patients and healthy volunteers. The researchers were able to identify people with melanoma with 79% accuracy and people without a melanoma with 84% accuracy.

""In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection,"" she said. ""So we are doing a clinical trial with 1000 participants to refine our test to get to this point.""

If further trials are successful, Ziman estimates the test could be distributed internationally in up to five years.

Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said.

Multiple groups worldwide are working to develop blood tests that detect a range of cancers. A recent study showed promise for a test detecting tumors of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung and breast, while another study claimed to detect 10 cancers, including 90% accuracy for ovarian cancer.

The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma.

'In the wrong place with the wrong skin color'

Melanoma cancers are dangerous, abnormal growths on the surface of the skin caused by sun damage, which can spread throughout the body if left untreated.

A melanoma skin cancer.

The problem is particularly serious in Australia, where melanomas were the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2017 and cause about 1,700 deaths a year, according to the university.

This is in large part due to high levels of UV exposure caused by the region's proximity to the ozone hole over the Antarctic.

""We're in the wrong place with the wrong skin color. We've had a lot of migrants from European nations, so they're fair-skinned ... and we do have a very intense sun here,"" Ziman said.

If detected early, skin cancers have a survival rate as high as 95%, the research team said, but it drops to just 50% if diagnosed late.

Surgery to remove the growth is the most common form of treatment.

Simpler detection

Ziman said current methods of melanoma detection are expensive and invasive, involving a trip to a clinician, who must biopsy the lesion to discover whether it is cancerous.

For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk.

Over three years, the research team identified a combination of 10 types of antibodies that best signal the presence of a melanoma.

Antibodies are the products of the body's immune system, created to battle not only bacteria and viruses but abnormal cancer cells, Ziman said.

Dr. Jodie Moffat, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, agreed that a test which finds melanoma earlier could help reduce deaths from the disease, adding that ""melanoma can be more than skin deep, and it's much harder to treat when diagnosed at a late stage after it has spread.""

However, she stressed the fact this new test has not undergone clinical trials.

""We need to know how accurate it is, if it can save lives, and how it could work in practice. So, although a blood test to find skin cancer earlier is certainly exciting, research in this field still has hurdles to overcome,"" she said.

In the meantime, ""people can help spot skin cancer early by knowing what's normal for their skin,"" said Moffat. In turn people should talk to a health professional about any ""unusual or lasting changes to a mole, freckle or normal patch of skin.""","Experimental blood test could detect melanoma skin cancer early, study finds",4,CNN

Every day, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, 65, takes a pill as part of his effort to help keep his brain healthy and sharp.

The pill is his blood pressure medication. And Koroshetz, who directs the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says controlling high blood pressure helps him reduce his risk of dementia.

He also keeps his blood pressure down by exercising and paying attention to his weight and diet. ""I'm a believer,"" he says.

Koroshetz is urging other people with high blood pressure to follow his lead.

He is responsible for the institute's public health campaign called Mind Your Risks. Its goal is to let people know that there is a link between high blood pressure, stroke and dementia.

When blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says.

""With every pulse of your heart, you are pushing blood into these very small blood vessels in the brain,"" he says. And when the heart pushes too hard, as it does when blood pressure is elevated, it can cause damage that can lead to a stroke.

At least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients, Koroshetz says.

""If you had a stroke, even a small stroke, your risk of dementia within the next two years was greatly magnified,"" he says. ""So there's something about having a stroke that drives a lot of the processes that give rise to dementia.""

The evidence is clearest for a type of dementia called vascular dementia. It occurs when something blocks or reduces the flow of blood to brain cells.

But high blood pressure also appears to increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.

If people knew about the link between dementia and high blood pressure, they might be more inclined to do something about it, Koroshetz says.

""Only about 50 percent of people who have hypertension are actually treated,"" he says. ""So I think there's a lot to be said for trying to get high blood pressure under control.""

Koroshetz's campaign is getting some help from the Alzheimer's Association.

The group will present new research on blood pressure and Alzheimer's at its annual scientific meeting in Chicago, which starts July 22. And the group is encouraging people to control high blood pressure.

""The good news is that we can control blood pressure now,"" says Maria Carrillo, the group's chief science officer. ""We can do that with exercise, with lifestyle, with healthy eating and also with medications.""

Koroshetz is using all of these approaches. And he says other people with high blood pressure should follow his lead.

story_reviews_00051,"A Simple Emergency Room Intervention Can Help Cut Suicide Risk

Enlarge this image toggle caption FangXiaNuo/Getty Images FangXiaNuo/Getty Images

Many people who attempt suicide end up in an emergency room for immediate treatment. But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.

Now, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.

""It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,"" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. ""That's a phenomenal difference.""

The study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.

You Are Not Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting 741741.

""When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,"" says Stanley. ""It's like a ticking time bomb.""

This is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.

""The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,"" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.

Many health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.

The intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.

""If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,"" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, "" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign."" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.

The next step is for the patient — with help from the clinician — to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.

For most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.

The coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.

If people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. ""For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,"" she says.

The provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. ""If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,"" she says.

Safety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient — the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.

That follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.

""People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,"" she says. ""And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.""

To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.

Among the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.

""The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,"" says Goldstein Grumet.

Rick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)

In September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. ""The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,"" Rick says. ""And she'd not shared any of that with us.""

The hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.

""The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,"" he says.

He says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.

Rick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.

He says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.

""It was something that she could follow through with,"" he says. ""It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.""

He says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.

""That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,"" says Ahmedani. ""The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.""

As part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.

While safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.

story_reviews_00052,"During a traumatic divorce, Ronni Shapiro of Westhampton Beach, N.Y., became severely depressed and suicidal. Psychiatrists put her on different antidepressants that only aggravated her situation.

“Within three months, I was on 10 different medications,” Shapiro, 61, said. “It was horrible.”

Eventually, she learned about GeneSight, a new type of genetic testing by Myriad Genetics, meant to help avoid the painful trial-and-error process many depression patients endure in the search for the right medicine. After a simple cheek swab, her results showed that pretty much everything she had previously tried was in the “significant gene interaction” category, meaning that based on her genetic makeup, these medicines would adversely affect her or prove ineffective at normal doses.

Guided by her results, her doctor thought that Wellbutrin would be a more promising option. And though the test is better at saying what won’t work than what will, her doctor’s decision proved the right one.

“I can’t tell you that I am footloose and fancy-free,” Shapiro said. “I still suffer. But when I fall into those dark holes, there’s like a ladder that I can see to climb up, as opposed to feeling helpless.”

As many as two-thirds of people with depression aren’t helped by the first antidepressant they try, leaving many to spend months after they are diagnosed without real help.

>> READ MORE: In despair from major depression, I turned to a last resort: Magnets

In May, Myriad Genetics released the first large-scale test of whether treatment guided by genetics (pharmacogenomics) would improve overall outcomes for patients with major depression. The study found that patients were 30 percent more likely to respond to treatment when their medication selection was guided by the company’s GeneSight test. The test uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze 12 different genes to weigh their combined influence on patient response to more than 55 psychotropic drugs. The patient’s color-coded report would read: “Use as directed” in green, “moderate gene-drug interaction” in yellow, and “significant gene interaction” in red.

Now, another company, Genomind in King of Prussia, is offering free education about its genetic test, Genecept Assay, at Sav-On pharmacies in two Philadelphia-area Acme Markets.

Specially trained pharmacists may decide to counsel patients about the Genecept test if they see a pattern of unsuccessful treatment with medicine for depression, anxiety, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

No magic solution

But while genetic testing offers tools to better guide patients’ treatment, it cannot tell doctors exactly which medicines will work – or necessarily provide the key to enduring remission from depression.

Vincent Sparks of Mullica Hill has benefited from genetic testing, but his mental health issues have persisted. Having battled anxiety and depression most of his life, Sparks, 60, was happy to find a genetic test to help his psychiatrist better direct his treatment. After taking the Genecept test, he discovered that a combination of Prozac and Lamictal was a better genetic fit for him than previous medications. But Sparks continues to struggle.

“I have times where I’m fairly level for a while, but at times it seems like I’m on a roller coaster,” Sparks said. “Sometimes I wish I could just take out my brain and wash it. If I could just put it through the rinse cycle, things would be better.”

Though imperfect, the Genecept test has been shown in peer-reviewed published studies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall medical costs. “In medicine in general, this will be standard of care at some point,” said Dan Dowd, Genomind vice president. “Twenty years from now, everyone will have some kind of pharmacological genetic test as part of their health record.”

GeneSight’s test is covered by Medicare for patients under the care of psychiatrists and who have failed to achieve satisfactory results with at least one antidepressant. The company has coverage with some commercial payers and is working to widen that coverage, said Myriad Genetics spokesman Ron Rogers. The Genomind Genecept Assay is covered by Medicare and Medicaid. If the out-of-pocket cost for people with commercial plans is more than $300, Genomind will contact the client before processing the test. The company also has a financial assistance program for uninsured patients.

“This is the beginning of personalized precision treatment,” said John Greden of the University of Michigan, primary investigator of the GeneSight study. “One-size treatment will never fit all, and we’re finally getting the tools, not just to say that but to act on it.”

‘Knowledge is a good thing’

Michael Thase, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and director of Penn’s Mood and Anxiety program, was another author of the GeneSight study. He stressed that although the test does not tell you exactly what will work, it can indicate a host of medications that will be ineffective.

“I think knowledge is a good thing, and having knowledge in improving the care of your patient is a good thing,” Thase said.

John O’Reardon, a Voorhees psychiatrist who treats patients with treatment-resistant depression and employs a form of neuromodulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), said that based on the results of the GeneSight study, he may start using this genetic test in his practice.

“The absolute numbers for response [26 percent] and remission [15.3 percent] don’t seem that high, but unfortunately that is what you get with increasing treatment resistance,” O’Reardon said about the GeneSight study. He was more impressed with the results patients experienced a half- year out. “By six months, the response rate was up to 50 percent and the remission rate was about 40 percent, which are excellent results,” he said.

For Marina Goldman, a Jenkintown psychiatrist in private practice, the GeneSight study was “interesting but really beside the point.”

Generally, she thinks that TMS and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), with their high success rates – approximately 75 percent to 83 percent for ECT and approximately 65 percent for TMS – offer more effective solutions for patients who have failed to respond to three or more antidepressants. At the same time, Goldman presents genetic testing as an option to patients with treatment-resistant depression who are wary about trying TMS or ECT.

“There’s a big debate right now in the psychiatric literature, and what they’re writing editorials about is that we’re waiting too long to refer patients out for neuromodulation,” Goldman said. “With the genetic testing, the chance of getting a response is about 20 percent. Why not move to ECT, where the chance is about 50 percent for treatment-resistant patients?”",Which antidepressant is right for you? This genetic test could help,3,Depression

story_reviews_00054,"(Reuters Health) - Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study.

The results suggest that vision fixes, like a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts, can go a long way toward helping older people stay mentally sharp, said lead author D. Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

“Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview.

Poor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.

To investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.

Over the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.

While the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn’t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.

She recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.

“This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research.

“If you’re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,” she said in a phone interview.

The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration “are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they’re detected early.”

story_reviews_00056,"Doctors Try Genetically Modified Poliovirus As Experimental Brain Cancer Treatment

A genetically modified poliovirus may help some patients fight a deadly form of brain cancer, researchers report.

The experimental treatment seems to have extended survival in a small group of patients with glioblastoma who faced a grim prognosis because standard treatments had failed, Duke University researchers say.

""I've been doing this for 50 years and I've never seen results like this,"" says Dr. Darell Bigner, the director emeritus of the The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at the Duke Cancer Institute, who is helping develop the treatment.

But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. In the study, only 21 percent of patients experienced a prolonged survival. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say.

""We have to be careful,"" says Annick Desjardins, a Duke neuro-oncologist who helped conduct the study. ""But we have long-term survivors. We are seeing something we don't normally see with patients with glioblastoma.""

Dr. David Reardon, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says the Duke group's results may represent ""a good, solid, important step forward"" for patients with no alternatives.

""Unfortunately, for most patients this is not going to be the answer yet,"" says Reardon, who used to work at Duke but wasn't involved in the new research. ""My fear is that every patient and family dealing with the devastating disease of glioblastoma is going to think the poliovirus is the cure. Unfortunately, the patients who are benefiting do reflect a relatively small percentage of the population.""

The Duke results were published online Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at the 22nd International Conference on Brain Tumor Research in Norway.

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It's the cancer that killed former Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is fighting glioblastoma.

The Duke researchers decided to try to use a genetically modified version of the poliovirus, which can cause a devastating form of paralysis, because of the virus's ability to infect nervous system cells.

The scientists removed one of the virus's genes to prevent it from causing polio and replaced that gene with one from a harmless virus known as a rhinovirus, which ordinarily causes the common cold.

The engineered virus was then infused directly into tumors in patients' brains with a tube inserted through a hole in the skull. The modified virus retains the ability to infect and kill brain tumor cells, and also appears to trigger the patient's own immune system cells to attack the tumors, the researchers say.

Between 2012 and 2017, the researchers treated 61 patients, trying various doses of the modified virus to determine which was safest and most effective.

There are substantial risks. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. One patient suffered a life-threatening blood clot in the brain that required surgery.

But overall, the median length of survival was 12.5 months for patients treated with poliovirus, compared with 11.3 months for a similar group of patients treated in the past, the researchers report. And starting at two years after treatment, the two groups' survival rate began to diverge, the researchers reported.

After 24 months, 21 percent of the patients treated with the virus had survived compared with 14 percent of the historical comparison group. After three years, 21 percent of the poliovirus treated patients survived, compared with 4 percent of the other group, according to the researchers.

Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. One has survived more than five years.

""You just don't see this percentage of long-term survivors with this disease,"" Bigner says. ""Those that have survived more than two years are in remission, and we expect them to continue to be long-term survivors.""

Some other researchers praised the results.

""We're extraordinarily encouraged by what we see with this data,"" says Mitchel Berger, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its center for brain tumors. ""It's phenomenal.""

But some cancer doctors caution that comparing the outcomes for patients receiving the virus treatment to what would have happened to similar patients in the past could produce misleading conclusions.

The Duke researchers have started a follow-up study combining the treatment with a chemotherapy drug to try to improve the results. They also plan to combine the treatment with other drugs, including some called checkpoint inhibitors, to harness the immune system to fight cancer.

In addition, the researchers are planning to try the approach on children with brain cancer, as well as other types of cancer, including melanoma and breast cancer.

AD

The disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.

AD

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was “a reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.” The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.

Gottlieb noted that the action was “not an approval of marijuana or all of its components” but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.

AD

The agency, he added, remains concerned about “the proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.”

In April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.

The FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances — meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.

AD

AD

Now that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn’t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.

For those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, “a recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,” Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. “We are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.”

The medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals. The drugmaker is testing other CBD treatments for glioblastoma and schizophrenia.

Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society and a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, has said the drug will be “a very valuable addition” to the limited options for treating severe childhood-onset epilepsy. Shinnar said he will welcome approval of a medicine that had undergone stringent FDA review for safety and effectiveness.

Many parents already are giving children unregulated CBD formulations that are available in medical marijuana dispensaries in the many states where such operations are legal. Some have said that they have no intention of switching to the new prescription CBD drug because the products they're using are helping their children. Others said they are anxious to try an FDA-approved product.

story_reviews_00059,"An experimental therapy for type 1 diabetes, widely derided by mainstream diabetes researchers, lowered blood sugar levels to near normal, a small, ongoing trial found. Patients in the trial, whose blood sugar levels have remained near normal for five to eight years, take about one-third less insulin than they did before, reducing their risk of hypoglycemia, in which insulin lowers blood sugar to dangerously low levels.

The experimental treatment, a decades-old generic vaccine for tuberculosis called bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), seems to alter both cellular metabolism and the immune system, said Dr. Denise Faustman of Massachusetts General Hospital, senior author of the study published Thursday in npj Vaccines. “This cheap, old vaccine is lowering blood sugar to levels never achieved before,” she said.

While the results, from only nine patients, must be replicated in a larger study, said Dr. Joseph Bellanti of Georgetown University Medical Center, “if what they found is true, they really have something here.” Bellanti, who was not involved in the research, said the study’s eight-year follow-up and use of a placebo control arm made him “cautiously optimistic” that two doses of the BCG vaccine “can decrease levels of A1c,” a measure of blood glucose that predicts the likelihood of serious complications such as stroke and kidney failure.

advertisement

JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation), the Joslin Diabetes Center, and several university diabetes centers all declined to speak about Faustman’s results. She has been a voice in the diabetes wilderness for nearly two decades, angering the establishment diabetes community by pursuing low-tech research very different from more popular approaches, such as embryonic stem cells and immunosupression.

Critics have gone so far as to send letters to newspapers that covered her work apologizing to patients “on behalf of Dr. Faustman” for “having their expectations cruelly raised.” She has also struggled for funding, receiving much of her research support from the private Iacocca Family Foundation, rather than in federal grants.

In Faustman’s Phase 1 clinical trial, three participants with type 1 diabetes received two doses of BCG vaccine, a month apart. After the vaccine showed signs of effectiveness, an additional six patients were vaccinated five years ago, and 111 more recently. The new paper and a presentation scheduled for a meeting of the American Diabetes Association this weekend focus on the patients who have been followed for more than five years.

All of those patients who received BCG had a statistically significant change in hemoglobin A1c. A normal level is below 6. In the vaccinated patients, A1c levels fell from an average of 7.36 before the first dose to 6.18 after five years, holding almost steady at 6.65 in the eighth year. In patients receiving a sham injection, levels showed almost no change from their initial levels of 7.10: 7.07 in the fifth year and 7.22 in the eighth.

“We wanted it to be good, but we didn’t know it would be this good,” Faustman said.

All of the patients remain on insulin, she said, but less of it. They are also able to monitor their blood sugar less frequently, which can be several times an hour. (The standard of care is a continuous glucose monitor, in which a probe is inserted into the abdomen, plus an insulin pump.) “If we can gradually move people to where they can control their blood sugar, their minute-to-minute lifestyle can improve dramatically,” Faustman said.

The A1c reductions could also bring significant health benefits. Every 10 percent drop, research shows, reduces complications such as stroke and heart attack by about one-third. The BCG vaccine lowered A1c levels 9 percent to 16 percent.

The new paper describes how the BCG vaccine, which has been used for nearly 100 years against tuberculosis and is considered extremely safe, might affect diabetes. According to studies in mice, it has two effects. It alters the immune system so as to increase levels of T regulatory cells; T regs keep other immune cells in check, including those that attack the pancreas’s insulin-making cells — the root cause of type 1 diabetes. In addition, BCG alters metabolism so cells consume higher levels of glucose, drawing more of it out of the blood, in a process called aerobic glycolysis.

“The clinical effects and the proposed mechanism demonstrated are exciting and add to the emerging consensus that the BCG vaccine can have a lasting and valuable impact on the immune system,” said Dr. Mihai Netea of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study.

A Phase 2 clinical trial of BCG is currently underway at Mass. General. It is testing multiple BCG doses in 150 patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes.

Although many studies of BCG are underway around the world in diabetes and other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, there has been little interest among U.S. researchers outside Faustman’s lab.

“There is not a lot of enthusiasm because we’re all rewarded for discovering for-profit drugs,” she said. “Potential funders come [to my lab] and ask, ‘How can we make money off this?’”

BCG, whose one licensed manufacturer in the U.S. is Merck subsidiary Organon Teknika, costs less than a dollar a dose. (Faustman used a strain made by Sanofi (SNY).) The U.S. market for insulin meters and insulin pumps is $20 billion. “With everyone thinking they need a pump and a meter, if you come along with an inexpensive vaccine that can change this standard of care, of course there will be pushback,” Faustman said.",Experimental type 1 diabetes vaccine causes improvement in small study,4,STAT

TUESDAY, June 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that a single blood test could confirm type 2 diabetes, saving patients time and health care costs.

Currently, it's recommended that a blood test focused on elevated fasting levels of blood sugar (glucose) or a blood component called glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) be confirmed with a second blood test at a follow-up visit.

But taking the test twice takes up time and money and could still result in missed diagnoses, said a team from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

In the new study, researchers led by Hopkins epidemiologist Elizabeth Selvin looked at data on more than 13,000 people in a long-running U.S. heart disease study. The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data.

Selvin's group analyzed that data, and reported that a positive result for glucose and HbA1c from just a single blood sample can confirm type 2 diabetes.

This could change care, ""potentially allowing a major simplification of current clinical practice guidelines,"" Selvin said in a university news release. ""Doctors are already doing these [glucose and HbA1c] tests together -- if a patient is obese, for example, and has other risk factors for diabetes, the physician is likely to order tests for both glucose and HbA1c from a single blood sample.

""It's just that the guidelines don't clearly let you use the tests from that one blood sample to make the initial diabetes diagnosis,"" she explained.

Diabetes is treatable, but about 3 million Americans with the disease don't know they have it.

""I'm hoping that these results will lead to a change in the clinical guidelines when they are revised in early 2019, which could make identifying diabetes a lot more efficient in many cases,"" Selvin said.

Diabetes experts welcomed the findings.

""Diabetes moves fast, and the cost of diabetes has increased more than 20 percent since 2012,"" noted Dr. Robert Courgi. The new study ""helps us move quicker to treat diabetes,"" he said.

""By diagnosing diabetes quicker, we can improve outcomes,"" said Courgi, an endocrinologist at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. ""The current standard is to delay diagnosis with repeat office visits and blood work. Now we can educate the patient sooner and start treatment earlier to prevent complications of diabetes such as heart attack, dialysis and amputations.""

Dr. Gerald Bernstein coordinates the Friedman Diabetes Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He agreed that quicker diagnosis could mean better treatment and outcomes for patients.

""The CDC reports that greater than 52 percent of the U.S. population has either clinical diabetes or prediabetes,"" Bernstein noted. ""Given these numbers, any abnormality of glucose should be regarded as sufficient reason to start preventative treatment with an education program, lifestyle change and first-line medication such as metformin.""

According to Bernstein, if only one diagnostic test were needed, ""this would mean that a follow-up visit would be a look at the treatment benefits -- rather than a confirmation of an abnormal glucose.""

The study was published June 19 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

story_reviews_00061,"Fasting diets have gained popularity in the past few years, but the scientific evidence proving that they keep us healthy while they help us lose weight is sparse. Now, researchers have shed light on what one type of time-restricted eating does to the body.

In a small, preliminary study, researchers put 23 obese volunteers on the 16:8 diet, a form of intermittent fasting. Followers of the popular regime eat during an eight-hour window, in this case between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. And for the 16 hours in between, they consume only calorie-free drinks, such as water.

For 12 weeks, the scientists measured various factors, including the participants' fat mass, blood pressure and cholesterol and glucose levels. The researchers compared the results to existing data from a separate weight loss trial carried out between 2011 and 2015.

Individuals who ate between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. consumed around 350 fewer calories, resulting in a loss of 3 percent body weight, and their blood pressure dropped by around 7mm Hg. However, their fat mass, insulin resistance and cholesterol levels were similar to the control group's.

Krista Varady, one of the study's authors and associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago's School of Applied Health Sciences, said in a statement that the take-home message from the study is that cutting out certain foods or counting calories aren’t the only effective methods for losing weight.

The authors noted that the results mirror those from previous studies of other forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate day fasting, where an individual eats normally every other day.

""But one of the benefits of the 16:8 diet may be that it is easier for people to maintain. We observed that fewer participants dropped out of this study when compared to studies on other fasting diets,” said Varady.

Further research is now needed to uncover whether 16:8 works better than other fasting diets in terms of weight loss and health benefits.

The study's authors acknowledged that their preliminary data offers ""promise for the use of time-restricted feeding as a weight loss technique in obese adults, but longer-term, large-scale randomized controlled trials [are needed].""

Varady stressed that ""when it comes to weight loss, people need to find what works for them, because even small amounts of success can lead to improvements in metabolic health.""

Commenting broadly on fast-style diets, James Catterson of the Institute of Healthy Ageing at University College London, who was not involved in the study, previously told Newsweek the jury is still out on fasting diets.

He said that the data on the effects of fasting in animals are more convincing, probably because animals can be investigated in large sample sizes and in a highly controlled environment that is almost impossible to replicate in humans.

""There are also many studies that either report no overall effect or sometimes the opposite. And this is where it gets a bit murky, as it is very difficult to put proper controls in place when performing studies to do with nutrition,"" Catterson said.

He concluded, ""So far, the consensus seems to be ‘let’s wait until more rigorous studies, with larger sample sizes that adjust for confounding lifestyle behaviors, have been performed before we conclude anything prematurely.'""",16:8 Fasting Diet Linked to Weight Loss and Health Benefits in Study,3,Newsweek

By testing a man’s DNA, researchers can look for genes linked to the disease, which one in seven men in the Western world will be diagnosed with in their lifetime.

Scientists in the U.K. and U.S. who helped piece together the study, published in Nature Genetics, found 63 new gene variants linked to prostate cancer. This was achieved by assessing the DNA of 80,000 prostate cancer patients and 61,000 men without the disease.

The resulting test hones in on these and the existing 100 known markers to pinpoint the 1 percent of men who are at six times greater risk of developing the condition, and the 10 percent of men who have a threefold greater risk of developing the disease, a study author told The Guardian.

The new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctor surgeries across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News.

If it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose.

Most men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease.

According to the American Cancer Society, over 160,600 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and around 29,400 people die of the disease. The condition is rare in those below the age of 40; older men and African-Americans are most at risk. The majority of cases are caught at around 66.

Rosalind Eeles, an author of the study at the U.K.-based Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) who specializes in finding genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, told The Guardian the team is “excited by the test” because it can be used by doctors to offer patients targeted screenings.

Carl Alexander, a spokesman from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: “This study is an exciting example of how research can find clues in our genes to help us uncover those more likely to develop the disease. The next steps should be to understand how this research can be developed into tests that could identify men who might be more likely to develop aggressive cancers, and how this could be rolled out to patients.”

Dr. Iain Frame, the director of research at the charity Prostate Cancer UK, highlighted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are two-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease compared to a man with no family history.

story_reviews_00063,"Premature labor is a serious and hard-to-predict problem. This test might help.

""Those molecules will circulate in the blood for some time, they can be measured, and you can see the contributions from essentially every tissue in the body,"" senior investigator Stephen Quake told BuzzFeed News. ""When you are pregnant you can see the contribution from the placenta and the fetus,"" said Quake, a professor of bioengineering and applied physics at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.

Both tests use cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which are snippets of genetic material released by cells when genes are active. They float around in the mother's bloodstream and can be picked up by blood tests.

However, a new blood test — which is still experimental and not yet available outside of a research lab — can pick up on gene activity in the body that suggests a pregnancy is at risk for preterm delivery, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science . The researchers also found a similar type of blood test could determine gestational age, which is used to calculate the due date of the baby. Currently, gestational age is calculated in the first trimester using ultrasound, and it's not that accurate if used later in pregnancy.

Pregnancies are usually about 40 weeks, and a premature birth is when a baby arrives three or more weeks early. This happens in about 9% of all deliveries and it can be seriously risky for the infant ; they can have all kinds of complications, including lung problems, brain hemorrhages, and infections.

The scientists analyzed 20,000 genes to find the ones that were active during pregnancy and labor.

They identified seven cfRNAs that seemed to be associated with premature birth, and in a test of 38 women, they found that they could predict premature birth up to two months in advance.

All the women were at risk for premature labor because they had early contractions or a previous preterm delivery, and 13 did indeed go on to have a premature baby.

In a subgroup of women, the test accurately classified 4 of 5 preterm deliveries as being at-risk, and incorrectly suggested that 3 of 18 women who had a full-term pregnancy were at risk for early labor.

In a test of 31 healthy pregnant women, testing for nine cfRNAs seemed roughly as accurate as an ultrasound at measuring gestational age. An ultrasound has a 48% accuracy rate at predicting a due date that's within two weeks of a baby's actual birth, while the blood test was 45% accurate. The test, if it does turn out to work in clinical trials, would be cheaper than ultrasound, said Quake.

""It might be tens or hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands,"" he said.

There's a lot more work to be done before these tests becomes available, including clinical trials. The studies were small and included only black or white women, but not other ethnicities. But the findings are promising, particularly because premature delivery is such a serious problem.

""Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death, it’s a huge problem,"" Quake said. If doctors know someone is at risk for premature labor earlier in pregnancy, they might start efforts to help delay labor, such as recommending bed rest.

Quake became interested in the problem in part because his first child was born almost a month premature. She's now a healthy 16-year-old. ""You realize, holy cow, that was a pretty risky thing that we had no control over and no sense that it was coming,"" he said.

""We’d like to see a bunch of lives saved, that’s really the goal here,"" Quake said. ""There’s a lot of work left to do before we get to that point, but we are pretty energized and excited at this point.""

The feasibility study was designed to see if texting could relieve some of the anxiety that comes with the fatigue, hair loss and other body changes that can accompany anticancer drugs.

Compared to 52 women who only received an American Cancer Society pamphlet on chemotherapy, the 48 women in the texting group reported an overall lower level of distress and a higher quality of life during their therapy. They also felt they had better communication with their doctors.

The text messages were most effective at reducing distress at the 2- and 4-month marks, according to the data presented by chief author Kuang-Yi Wen, an assistant professor in the Cancer Prevention and Control program at Fox Chase. At the fourth month mark, “the gap was huge” between the texting and control groups, she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

Texting also played a role in helping patients feel like they were in control of their treatment, particularly during the first month.

Texting did not affect the odds of developing symptoms of depression.

Surprisingly, the older the patient, the greater the likelihood that she would text back, seeking more information.

One of the patients texted the program 1,217 times. “That’s what’s good about this program. Everyone has different information-seeking behavior” and the system can respond to that, Dr. Wen said.

For six years now, life has been really good for James. He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.

And it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.

Before ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.

Ketamine ""helped me get my life back,"" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.

Ketamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.

But ketamine's story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine ""off label"" to thousands of depressed patients who don't respond to other drugs.

And pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.

Meanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.

""I think it's actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,"" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.

Ketamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.

James had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. ""I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,"" he says.

He spent much of his childhood terrified of ""an unknown, an ambiguous force out there."" The fear was ""overwhelming,"" he says. ""I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.""

And there was something else about James: his body temperature.

""I overheated constantly,"" he says. ""I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.""

In his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.

At first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn't, no matter how many he took.

He'd done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn't going well.

""ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,"" he says. ""So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.""

James had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.

""My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,"" he says. ""She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I'd call her just screaming, 'Please come home. I can't get through another minute.' ""

Eventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

""He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,"" Papolos says. ""He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.""

Papolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the ""fear of harm phenotype."" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn't respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.

But Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. ""It's been transformational,"" he says.

In January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.

Scientists still aren't sure why ketamine works, but there's evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.

""I think it's having multiple effects, and that means it's probably useful for multiple different disorders,"" Teicher says.

One of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.

James started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.

""One day I turn to my wife and I'm like, 'I feel calm today. I don't know if it's the sun coming in, I don't know if it's just the way we're sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.' ""

The next day, James did sit down at his computer. A month later, he was back at work.",From Chaos To Calm: A Life Changed By Ketamine,1,NPR
story_reviews_00066,"A blood test for 10 different types of cancers could one day help doctors screen for the disease before patients show symptoms, researchers at the world’s largest gathering of oncologists have said.

The test, called a liquid biopsy, screens for cancer by detecting tiny bits of DNA released by cancer cells into blood. The test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, though the number of cancers detected was small.

Researchers hope the test will become part of a “universal screening” tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients.

“This is potentially the holy grail of cancer research, to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure,” said Dr Eric Klein, lead author of the research from Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute. “We hope this test could save many lives.”

The study, by a research team that also included scientists from Stanford University, was presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists in Chicago.

Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said “new techniques” such as cancer blood tests could “unlock enormous survival gains, as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine”.

“Now, as the NHS marks its 70th anniversary, we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases,” said Stevens.

The research scrutinised the cases of more than 1,600 people, 749 of whom were cancer-free at the time of the study, with no diagnosis, and 878 of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease.

The test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic, ovarian, liver and gallbladder cancers, correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients.

The blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy, at 77% and 73%, and bowel cancer in two out of three patients. Lung cancer was detected in 59% of patients. Head and neck cancer was detected in 56% of patients.

Researchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer, but noted further “clinical development” was needed.

The number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small. For example, although the test detected ovarian cancer with 90% accuracy, only 10 ovarian cancers in total were detected.

Nevertheless, researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history. “Potentially this test could be used for everybody,” said Klein.

Prof Nicholas Turner from the Institute of Cancer Research in London described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool. “Far too many cancers are picked up too late, when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim,” he said. “The goal is to develop a blood test, such as this one, that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages.”

Klein added: “It is several steps away and more research is needed, but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age, such as those over 40, to see if they have early signs of cancer.”",'Holy grail of cancer research': doctors positive about early detection blood test,2,The Guardian
story_reviews_00067,"A surprising (but welcome) side effect of a therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder may pave the way for a new approach to treating type 2 diabetes — and offer new insights into the links between obesity and the metabolic disease that afflicts close to 1 in 10 American adults.

The therapy in question is deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens, a structure best known for its role in motivation, reward and addiction. It now appears that deep brain stimulation also increases the liver’s and muscles’ ability to take up and use insulin, researchers reported this week.

That’s important because the ability to use insulin effectively is compromised in most people with obesity and seriously impaired in those with type 2 diabetes.

This curious side effect of deep brain stimulation became clear after an obese man with diabetes who had suffered the repetitive thoughts and behaviors of OCD was treated for the psychiatric condition with a device that delivers electrical impulses into the brain.

Once the device was implanted and turned on, it prompted the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine throughout the ventral striatum, in which the nucleus accumbens sits. In short order, the patient noticed that his blood sugar control improved, and his daily need for insulin injections decreased by roughly 80%.

The new study appeared this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

The research is likely to generate renewed interest in understanding the addictive powers of food for some people and whether the brain processes behind that addiction also make people with obesity more vulnerable to diabetes, depression, heart disease and even some cancers.

“The connection between brain and metabolism is only partially understood,” said Dr. Miguel Alonso-Alonso, who directs Harvard University’s Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative. Most research to date has focused on the hormonal influence of the hypothalamus, a structure adjoining the ventral striatum, on basic bodily functions, he added.

“This is a new and exciting direction with the involvement of the striatum, a key reward center,” Alonso-Alonso said. At the same time, he cautioned that “we first need to establish the nature of this association, understand its magnitude and its clinical relevance” before these early findings could be considered the basis for treatment.

That a single patient’s metabolic function improved after he got a pacemaker in the brain might have met with a shrug anywhere else. But to the Dutch authors of the new research, it was a clue that warranted further investigation.

To explore the brain’s role in metabolism more rigorously, the researchers, led by Kasper W. ter Horst of the University of Amsterdam’s Academic Medical Center, recruited 14 patients who also had had a brain stimulator implanted at the edge of the nucleus accumbens as treatment for OCD.

None of the 14 subjects recruited had type 2 diabetes. But even healthy people vary daily and hourly in the ability of fat, liver and muscles to take up insulin from the bloodstream and use it to convert food to energy.

This measure of metabolic health is called “insulin sensitivity,” and it is one of many metabolic functions that goes awry in people with obesity. In those who develop type 2 diabetes, sensitivity to insulin becomes so impaired that the body is tricked into believing less insulin is needed, and it pares back its production. The insulin-producing cells in the pancreas will often atrophy and die in response. As a person’s insulin production declines, an external supply of insulin is needed to control blood sugar and deliver fuel to muscles and organs.

As the researchers turned the 12 subjects’ brain stimulators on and off, they could see the subjects’ insulin sensitivity rise and fall. Metabolic function was better when their brain stimulators were turned on than when the devices were silenced.

The Dutch team ruled out that the performance improvement came from changes in other hormones that can affect metabolism, such as cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens appeared to be effecting the changes.

The researchers also gleaned a potentially important insight about how obesity may lead to worsening metabolic function: The effect of the deep brain stimulation appeared to be greater in the seven research subjects who were lean than it was in the seven who were either overweight or obese. Since long-term obesity is linked to changes in the striatal dopamine system, the differing responses of lean and overweight subjects suggest that those changes may start the ball rolling toward development of type 2 diabetes..

In a further experimental group of 10 healthy humans, the researchers found that using drugs to reduce dopamine levels across the body generated the opposite response, decreasing insulin sensitivity.

In mice, too, the researchers explored the role of the dopamine-fueled neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Using a technique called optogenetics, they bred mice with certain brain cells that could be activated when light of a particular frequency is shined on them.

Light stimulation of the dopamine-expressing neurons in the brains of mice “was sufficient to improve glucose tolerance” and improve insulin sensitivity, the authors reported. That suggests “a key role for striatal neuronal activity in the central regulation of metabolism,” they added.

The emerging data “suggest that the brain may play a much more active and complex role in the regulation of metabolism than we usually believe,” said Alonso-Alonso, who has explored the brain’s role in metabolism by using a less invasive means of activation called transcranial magnetic stimulation.

“This makes sense, because at the end, metabolic needs should align well with the overall state of the individual,” he said. It stands to reason that there’s cross-talk among key physiological functions; an individual’s cognitive, mental and social states; and situational circumstances, he added.

“I think there are real good opportunities here for this integrative research; we need to learn more about this connection,” Alonso-Alonso said.

story_reviews_00068,"THURSDAY, May 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Because vertigo can have many causes, treating it can be difficult, but researchers have identified a new type that may be effectively treated with medication.

""These conditions can be difficult to diagnose and quite debilitating for people, so it's exciting to be able to discover this new diagnosis of a condition that may respond to treatment,"" said Dr. Ji-Soo Kim, a researcher at Seoul National University in South Korea.

Vertigo -- episodes of dizziness that can last for minutes or days -- may be triggered by a number of health issues, ranging from an inner ear disorder to tumors. In some cases, the cause is unclear. Patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms, including vomiting, headaches and motion sickness.

For the study, researchers recruited 338 people who had vertigo with an unknown cause. Some had attacks rarely, maybe once a year. Others had them two to three times a week. Participants also developed nausea, headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks.

To diagnose the new vertigo, the researchers had patients sit in a dark room. They then moved each patient's head forward and shook it from side to side for about 15 seconds.

Afterwards, a video recorded the patients' eye movements. The researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements, called nystagmus, lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo.

The findings were published online May 23 in Neurology.

""It's possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person's body or in their environment,"" Kim said in a journal news release.

This new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head-shaking nystagmus. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo.

They were compared to 35 others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions, including the inner ear disorder Meniere's disease. Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere's and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis.

Those with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed.

Preventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely.

The researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of 12 years. Five had no more attacks, 14 had an improvement in their condition, and only one person had a worsening of symptoms. The others' outcomes were not revealed.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday expanded the use of Novartis AG’s relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Gilenya to treat children and adolescents.

MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults.

Gilenya is the first FDA-approved drug to treat pediatric patients suffering from relapsing MS, the U.S. health regulator said.

In a clinical trial 86 percent of patients receiving Gilenya remained relapse-free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 46 percent of those who were administered another MS drug.

story_reviews_00073,"Updated | An existing drug used to treat a common bone disorder could hold the key to the cure for baldness, according to a new study.

Current treatments for hair loss are limited to two FDA-approved drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, which have mixed results. The other option is minimally invasive hair transplant surgery. In the U.S., there are around 50 million men and 30 million women affected by hair loss, which U.K.-based researchers said could be the source of “psychological distress.”

In a study conducted on human hair follicles, researchers investigated a drug called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been prescribed to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection since the 1980s. Side effects including shaking, headaches, vomiting and swollen gums—as well as unwanted hair growth.

The research team, lead by Dr. Nathan Hawkshaw at the University of Manchester, investigated whether CsA could provide some clues for treating baldness.

After treating hair with CsA, the scientists analyzed the gene expressions of isolated human scalp hair follicles. They found that CsA changed how the follicles expressed a protein called SFRP1, which stunts the development and growth of hair follicles and other tissues in the body.

The scientists were then able to identify that WAY-316606, a compound used to treat osteoporosis, has a similar effect on how SFRP1 is expressed.

The compound WAY-316606 could therefore be used to treat baldness, without patients suffering the same side effects as they would on CsA. The study was published in the journal PLOS Biology.

Dr. Hawkshaw said in a statement: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair-loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.”

“Clearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair-loss patients.”

A British Association of Dermatologists spokesperson said in a statement the results were interesting.

“For individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss, there isn’t one which is universally effective. For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.

“This research has been tested on human tissue, which is promising, but not on humans themselves, so there is still some way to go.

“It is also important to realise that this is being proposed as a treatment for hair loss, not a cure as such.”

When treating a patient suffering from depression, Brent Forester considers which anti-depressant to prescribe—ideally, one that will ease psychic pain without side effects.

It can be a tough call.

Deciding “becomes somewhat of an art—and a lot of it is educated guesswork,” says Dr. Forester, chief of geriatric psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He worries that sometimes psychiatrists “may think we are better than we really are” at making these choices.

That may change as Dr. Forester and others enlist genomics, a form of precision medicine and an intriguing new frontier for the elusive science of the human psyche. Other branches of medicine, such as oncology, have embraced gene-based testing to help determine which cancer patients need chemotherapy or surgery. But psychiatrists typically haven’t let genomics guide treatment decisions, Dr. Forester says.

One test, called GeneSight, uses a genetic analysis of DNA samples from a cheek swab to help doctors figure out which drugs are likely to combat a patient’s depression. The test examines a dozen genes to determine how well the patient will metabolize certain drugs and how his or her brain will respond to them.

The test predicts the effects of more than 50 anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Based on a patient’s results, drugs are categorized as ones to be avoided, ones that have some drawbacks and ones that can be used “as directed.”

Barbara Dellovade, a retired real estate broker in Acton, Mass., became depressed last year. Ms. Dellovade, who is 78 years old, was taking an anti-depressant, but “I wasn’t reacting well to it and it wasn’t helping me at all.” She consulted Ipsit Vahia, a geriatric psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

More The Food That Helps Battle Depression

Dr. Vahia told Ms. Dellovade about the genomics test, which retails for $1,500 and is covered by Medicare and some health plans. After receiving an analysis of Ms. Dellovade’s results, he switched her to a different anti-depressant and she began to respond in about six weeks, he says. Ms. Dellovade has been feeling better, she says, though “I am still not there.”

Dr. Vahia has been using the gene test more with his older depressed patients but says clinical judgment remains paramount in prescribing. “The brain...is the most complex organ in the body,” he says. “This is a small step, but it is an important step. We are adding a degree of precision” to treating depression.

McLean Hospital is one of 60 sites across the country that took part in a randomized trial of GeneSight. The results, which will be unveiled this week at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed that patients fared better when physicians chose a medication with the help of the test, rather than relying solely on their judgment.

Among the 1,167 patients in the trial, half took the GeneSight test and half were prescribed drugs based purely on their doctors’ clinical assessments. Genetics helps you “marry” a patient with the appropriate medication, says Bryan Dechairo, executive vice president for clinical development at Myriad Genetics, which funded the trial. Assurex Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, developed the GeneSight test.

The results were striking, according to doctors at several medical centers who participated in the trial. Patients were more likely to respond to anti-depressants when the gene test was used to determine which drug they should be on; researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied. Every patient in the trial had been on at least one anti-depressant that failed to work, and some had been on several that failed.

The study shows that genetic tests can lead to better prescribing decisions, says John Greden, the principal investigator in the trial. Dr. Greden, a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, says that until now, many doctors took the following approach: “My favorite anti-depressant is this one, so I will try it. Oh, that didn’t work, so I will try this one.”

Unfortunately, he says, under that hit-or-miss method—albeit informed by training and experience—“fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission.” Every year, 16 million Americans suffer an episode of depression, he says, making pinpointed diagnoses essential.

Some doctors took a while to come around to the GeneSight test. Charles DeBattista, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, says initially he was “somewhat skeptical.”

“Prior to the study I used it very rarely,” says Dr. DeBattista, who specializes in patients with treatment-resistant depression. He has been using the test more on patients who “have had problems tolerating medicine in the past,” he says. “There is nothing magical about it; it is not a substitute for clinical judgment.” But it does inform him what drug to try on a patient with serious depression.

His Stanford colleague Alan Schatzberg isn’t persuaded. The test “has some value,” says Dr. Schatzberg, a psychiatrist and a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. “It has some use but what it doesn’t do is tell you which specific drug to use.” He adds, “What the field really wants is a test that tells me which specific drug I should put my patient on.”

That is precisely what Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, likes about it. The test “provides recommendations,” Dr. Conway says. “It doesn’t say: ‘Give this drug only.’ It says: ‘You have a range of choices, which you will [make] based on your clinical judgment.’ ”",Which Anti-Depressant Is Right for You?

THURSDAY, May 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Much of the debate over when to start having mammograms has focused on lives saved, but new research suggests that early screening might also translate into smaller tumors and less aggressive breast cancer treatments.

""There are multiple benefits of mammography in terms of early detection. Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,"" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.

Currently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.

Port noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.

""But isn't there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it's safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,"" she said.

Port's study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.

The women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis. The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram.

Women in the second group were 50 percent more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.

Port also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also more likely to have larger tumors (by 10 millimeters, on average) and to need a mastectomy than those in the 24 months or less group. But only 29 women fell into the ""never had a mammogram"" group.

However, the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between earlier mammograms and smaller tumors and less aggressive treatment.

And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution.

Still, ""the observations are consistent with what we have seen with the value of early detection. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required. But this study doesn't tell us about long-term outcomes or what transpired over a long period of time,"" he said.

Also, because of the nature of the study and the small sample size in the young age group sub-analysis, Lichtenfeld said that ""this cannot be interpreted as a study telling us what age to start mammograms.""

The study is to be presented Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons meeting, in Orlando, Fla. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

In follow-up psychotherapy, patients process emotions and insights brought up during the MDMA session. The current protocol calls for patients to take MDMA two or three times, each a month apart, interspersed with psychotherapy.

“The MDMA alone or the therapy alone don’t appear to be as effective,” Dr. Mithoefer said. “The MDMA seems to act as a catalyst that allows the healing to happen.”

“I was actually able to forgive myself,” said Nigel McCourry, 36 a Marine veteran who was deployed in 2004 to Falluja, Iraq, whose experiences mirrored those of three other patients interviewed.

Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts.



Partial replacements are also cheaper, say researchers from Oxford University. The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.

Knees, stretching and heel-striking: three running myths debunked Read more

Partial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.



Researchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.

The main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.

“The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,” said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.

“This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.”

Whether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer.

“This is an important finding,” said co-lead researcher Prof David Murray. “If surgeons aim to use partial knees in a quarter or more of their knee replacements this will substantially improve the results of knee replacement and will save money. In addition, more partial knee replacements will be done and more patients will benefit from this procedure.”

Ed Burn, first author of the paper, said they needed to get surgeons on board. “For patients and the NHS to see the benefits of partial replacements, we need the buy-in of surgeons, who would need to feel comfortable performing a greater proportion of their knee replacements as partials,” he said.

“If we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.”",Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report,2,The Guardian

THURSDAY, April 26, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- After a stroke, many patients are given the clot-busting intravenous drug alteplase, but another drug may be more effective, Australian researchers report.

Among more than 200 stroke victims, TNKase (tenecteplase) was about twice as effective as alteplase in restoring blood flow to the brain, and it also resulted in less disability, the scientists found.

""Tenecteplase is likely to become the preferred medication for clot-dissolving in stroke patients,"" said lead researcher Dr. Bruce Campbell, head of the stroke department at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Parkville. ""It is likely to change stroke treatment guidelines and clinical practice.""

Campbell said tenecteplase is more effective than alteplase because of differences in the enzymes in each drug.

Although both drugs work in the same way, tenecteplase is better at attacking and dissolving clots, and more resistant to factors that inhibit the breakdown of clots, he said.

For either drug to be most effective, it needs to be given as soon as possible after a stroke occurs. In this study, patients were given the drugs within 4.5 hours after the onset of a stroke, Campbell said.

Although tenecteplase appears to be more effective for stroke patients, it's not approved for that use in the United States, according to Dr. Rohan Arora, director of stroke at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Forest Hills, N.Y.

In 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved tenecteplase for use after a heart attack, Arora said.

""Tenecteplase is being widely used in developing countries, such as India,"" he said. ""One reason is it's cheaper than alteplase.""

In the United States, tenecteplase costs about $5,800, versus alteplase, which costs $8,000, Arora said.

In addition, tenecteplase is easier to give, requiring only a single injection, while alteplase requires an injection and an IV drip, he added.

Arora explained that tenecteplase is not widely used in the United States for heart attack patients because these patients are typically treated with angioplasty or heart bypass surgery.

For the new study, which did not receive drug company funding, Campbell and his colleagues randomly assigned 202 stroke patients to either alteplase or tenecteplase before surgery to remove clots.

The researchers specifically looked to see which drug was better at restoring blood flow to clot-blocked blood vessels in the brain, and which drug resulted in patients having better outcomes.

The investigators found that 22 percent of the patients treated with tenecteplase had more than 50 percent of blood flow return to the brain, compared with 10 percent of those treated with alteplase.

Patients treated with tenecteplase also had better functional outcomes after 90 days than those given alteplase, the findings showed.

Bleeding into the brain, the most serious side effect of either drug, occurred in 1 percent of patients, regardless of which drug they received, Campbell said.

The report was published April 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

story_reviews_00079,"Scientists have announced the development of a highly accurate and reliable technique for diagnosing prostate cancer. The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.

Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition.

“Current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,” said the Dundee University team’s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. “Our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.”

The prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.

Each carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive.

The new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour.

“We have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,” added Nabi. “The technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.”

The trial tests involved around 200 patients. “Now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,” Nabi said.

SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team.

“The technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,” said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation).

“With an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.”

In the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour.

“This breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,” said Fry. “It is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.

story_reviews_00080,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A late-stage trial of Amgen Inc’s experimental drug Aimovig found that it reduced episodic migraines by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments, while 14 percent of placebo patients achieved that goal, the company said on Tuesday.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California October 21, 2013. The biopharmaceutical company reports earnings on Tuesday. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

The 12-week trial, presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, involved 246 patients suffering four to 14 migraine headaches a month who had tried two to four preventive treatments that either did not work for them or had intolerable side effects.

“This is a trial in really difficult to treat patients,” professor Uwe Reuter, trial investigator and managing medical director at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments.

Reuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies.

Aimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17.

Amgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial.

Similar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.

Aimovig has the “potential to help fill treatment gaps in more difficult patient populations whose migraine has not been adequately managed with current therapies,” Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement.

Amgen said Aimovig trial patients also had statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in secondary trial goals including fewer monthly migraine days and better physical function.

Researchers said no Aimovig patients stopped treatment due to side effects, while around 1 percent of placebo patients discontinued because of side effects.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, April 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic back pain often try painkillers and other treatments without success. Now, a new study suggests a program of education and exercise may provide relief.

Helping patients think differently about pain and encouraging them to move in ways they previously feared appears to ease pain and improve function, researchers say.

""People with chronic neck and/or back pain should be educated about their pain, [and] should be reassured,"" said lead researcher Anneleen Malfliet.

They should ""learn to put pain into the right perspective, should remain active or increase their activity levels gradually, and should avoid fear of moving,"" said Malfliet, of Vrije University Brussels in Belgium.

Physical therapists and doctors can guide patients in this process, she added.

""They should also avoid the use of scary, unreassuring labels or diagnoses,"" and not limit movement in therapy, she said.

To test the experimental approach, Malfliet and her colleagues randomly assigned 22 men and 38 women to the program. They assigned another 25 men and 35 women to standard care -- exercise, and back and neck education.

""The experimental therapy, focusing on functionality, not using pain as a reliable symptom, and not as a guideline to adapt movements or activities, leads to better treatment outcomes,"" Malfliet said.

The program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said.

Patients in the program reported 50 percent less pain after the treatment. They also reported paying less attention to pain.

In general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.

""These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,"" Malfliet said.

The program involves ""pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,"" she said.

What does that mean?

Pain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.

Besides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching. Participants also learned the value of strength, endurance and fitness training.

Many back patients are afraid certain movements will cause them pain, so they avoid them. The new exercises are designed to help overcome that fear, Malfliet said.

The regimen included the best known exercises for back pain and general exercises, she said. It also included group classes, online activities and personalized training sessions.

""Be active, and move without fear of pain or reinjury,"" Malfliet said. ""Your level of activity or way of moving before the chronic pain began should be used as a guideline target.""

Whereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain's gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said.

Dr. Kiran Patel is director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

Patel said the dual mental and exercise approach is used to treat phantom pain in patients after a limb amputation. It's rarely used for back pain, she said.

But this study suggests these methods also can help reduce spinal pain, she said.

""The program, however, is quite time-intensive and is not covered by insurance,"" Patel said.

""Although it's promising, we really have to see the benefit long-term to justify the cost,"" she added.

The report was published online April 16 in JAMA Neurology.

story_reviews_00082,"The reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.

AD

“Immunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,” said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. “Instead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.”

AD

Lung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.

Most patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer — disease that has spread beyond its original site — initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don’t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.

AD

The trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer — a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.

AD

After a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.

“For the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,” she said.

AD

Scientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”

Roy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.

AD

Last May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn’t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.

AD

Experts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.

Last week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.

AD

In a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications — Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb — to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.

AD

The patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.

He said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high “tumor mutational burden,” but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.

AD

Another study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way — for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo — the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation — to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.

AD

Nine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a “major pathologic response” — a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.

Drew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.

story_reviews_00083,"Researchers report some of the most encouraging results yet for treating lung cancer with the latest immune-based treatments, most of which have been approved to treat other types of tumors.

In three papers presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, lung cancer experts found innovative ways to weaken lung tumors to improve people’s chances of surviving the disease.

“There is definitely a high unmet need,” says Patrick Forde, assistant professor of oncology and associate member of the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins, of the lack of effective treatments for lung cancer. Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people’s chances of living five years — but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.

The studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body’s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.

In one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.

What’s more, say the study’s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.

Currently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person’s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person’s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person’s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, “more than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,” says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, “a year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.”

The results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.

There may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced NSCLC. In another study, researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune-based checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy. People getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51% less likely to die after 10.5 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone. “The magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see,” says Dr. Leena Gandhi, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-author of the study. Pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25% to 30% of people with advanced NSCLC who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug, but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy.

The results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. In a third, small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease, researchers led by a team at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse, thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer. When the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out, they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab, the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells, meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system’s killer cells to attack them. And when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy, they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells, suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer.

“We expected to see some response, but I don’t think we expected to see a 45% significant response,” says Forde. “To give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.”

Forde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time — possibly even a lifetime. “The Holy Grail is to have a relatively non-toxic therapy that could potentially use the body’s own immune system to prevent recurrence,” he says. “And while our study is only with 21 patients, the early indications from this study are very positive.”

Taken together, the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated, significantly improving people’s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time, as well as live longer with the disease.

story_reviews_00084,"Government and other scientists are proposing a new way to define Alzheimer's disease — basing it on biological signs, such as brain changes, rather than memory loss and other symptoms of dementia that are used today.

The move is aimed at improving research, by using more objective criteria like brain scans to pick patients for studies and enroll them sooner in the course of their illness, when treatments may have more chance to help.

But it's too soon to use these scans and other tests in routine care, because they haven't been validated for that yet, experts stress. For now, doctors will still rely on the tools they've long used to evaluate thinking skills to diagnose most cases.

Regardless of what tests are used to make the diagnosis, the new definition will have a startling effect: Many more people will be considered to have Alzheimer's, because the biological signs can show up 15 to 20 years before symptoms do.

""The numbers will increase dramatically,"" said Dr. Clifford R. Jack Jr., a Mayo Clinic brain imaging specialist. ""There are a lot more cognitively normal people who have the pathology in the brain who will now be counted as having Alzheimer's disease.""

He led a panel of experts, working with the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging, that updated guidelines on the disease, published Tuesday in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association.

ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S

About 50 million people worldwide have dementia, and Alzheimer's is the most common form. In the U.S., about 5.7 million have Alzheimer's under its current definition, which is based on memory problems and other symptoms. About one-third of people over 70 who show no thinking problems actually have brain signs that suggest Alzheimer's, Jack said.

There is no cure — current medicines such as Aricept and Namenda just temporarily ease symptoms. Dozens of hoped-for treatments have failed, and doctors think one reason may be that the studies enrolled patients after too much brain damage had already occurred.

""By the time that you have the diagnosis of the disease, it's very late,"" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah, neuroscience chief at the Institute on Aging.

""What we've realized is that you have to go earlier and earlier and earlier,"" just as doctors found with treating cancer, he said.

Another problem: as many as 30 percent of people enrolled in Alzheimer's studies based on symptoms didn't actually have the disease — they had other forms of dementia or even other medical conditions. That doesn't give an accurate picture of whether a potential treatment might help, and the new definition aims to improve patient selection by using brain scans and other tests.

BETTER TESTS

Many other diseases, such as diabetes, already are defined by measuring a biomarker, an objective indicator such as blood sugar. That wasn't possible for Alzheimer's disease until a few years ago, when brain scans and spinal fluid tests were developed to do this.

They measure certain forms of two proteins — amyloid and tau — that form plaques and tangles in the brain — and signs of nerve injury, degeneration and brain shrinkage.

The guidelines spell out use of these biomarkers over a spectrum of mental decline, starting with early brain changes, through mild impairment and Alzheimer's dementia.

WHAT TO DO?

People may be worried and want these tests for themselves or a family member now, but Jack advises: ""Don't bother. There's no proven treatment yet.""

You might find a doctor willing to order them, but spinal fluid tests are somewhat invasive, and brain scans can cost up to $6,000. Insurance usually does not pay because they're considered experimental outside of research. A large study is underway now to see whether Medicare should cover them and when.

Anyone with symptoms or family history of dementia, or even healthy people concerned about the risk can consider enrolling in one of the many studies underway.

""We need more people in this pre-symptomatic stage"" to see if treatments can help stave off decline, Masliah said.

story_reviews_00085,"I love my local YMCA for many reasons beyond my daily swim. Top of the list: the friendships and conversations in the locker room that are frequent sources of valuable information, connections and motivation. For example, I recently overheard a discussion about Y members and friends of members who had experienced devastating attacks of shingles, including one woman who nearly lost an eye and another who was left with unrelenting nerve pain.

That was the push I needed to end my procrastination about getting the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October after studies involving 16,600 people showed it to be far more effective at preventing this disease than the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, which I had had a decade earlier. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 50 and older, including those previously immunized with Zostavax, should now get the Shingrix vaccine.

The process was surprisingly simple and less costly than I had anticipated (list price is $280 for the two-part shot without insurance). All I needed was a prescription from my doctor. I took it to my local pharmacy, where a staff pharmacist administered the vaccine. I’ll get the second part the same way in May. My Medicare Part D insurance covered it with a $40 co-pay for each part. (The cost may be higher if the vaccine is administered in a doctor’s office, so check first.)

Many millions of Americans, especially those older than 40, are susceptible to an eventual attack of shingles, caused by the very same virus that causes chickenpox. Once this virus, varicella zoster, infects a person, it lies dormant for decades in nerve roots, ready to pounce when the immune system is weakened, say, by stress, medication, trauma or disease. One-third of Americans eventually get shingles, but the risk rises with age, and by age 85 half of adults will have had at least one outbreak of shingles.",Why You Should Get the New Shingles Vaccine,3,New York Times

(CNN) Experts have proposed using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction. Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.

The studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.

The researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.

""This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,"" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.

""And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.""

Medicare Part D, the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in Medicare, covers more than 42 million Americans, including those 65 or older. Medicaid provides health coverage to more than 73 million low-income individuals in the US, according to the program's website

""Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,"" Bradford said. ""But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.""

'This crisis is very real'

The new research comes as the United States remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen. Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II

""As somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders, this crisis is very real. These patients die every day, and it's quite shocking in many ways,"" said Dr. Kevin Hill , an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new studies.

""We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,"" he added. ""I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.""

Like opioids, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain, including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance, dependence and addiction.

""All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,"" Hill said. ""So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.""

But unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.

""No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,"" Bradford said. ""And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.""

Comparing states with and without medical marijuana laws

In order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.

Both teams, in fact, did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws. The team that looked at Medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions, according to Hefei Wen , assistant professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky and a lead author on the Medicaid study.

""We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,"" Wen said. ""And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.""

The first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.

The details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.

The method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.

""We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,"" Bradford said. ""So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.""

The impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.

Fentanyl prescriptions under Medicare Part D also dropped by 8.5% in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws, though the difference was not statistically significant, Bradford said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, like heroin, that can be prescribed legally by physicians. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and even a small amount can be fatal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse

""I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,"" Bradford said. ""But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.""

'A call to action'

This is not the first time researchers have found a link between marijuana legalization and decreased opioid use. A 2014 study showed that states with medical cannabis laws had 24.8% fewer opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010. A study in 2017 also found that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado in 2012 reversed the state's upward trend in opioid-related deaths.

""There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that legal access to marijuana can reduce the use of opioids as well as opioid-related overdose deaths,"" said Melissa Moore , New York deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance. ""In states with medical marijuana laws, we have already seen decreased admissions for opioid-related treatment and dramatically reduced rates of opioid overdoses.""

Some skeptics, though, argue that marijuana legalization could actually worsen the opioid epidemic. Another 2017 study , for example, showed a positive association between illicit cannabis use and opioid use disorders in the United States. But there may be an important difference between illicit cannabis use and legalized cannabis use, according to Hill.

""As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it's imperative that we do more research,"" Hill said. ""We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven't done it to the degree that we should.""

The two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.

But both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.

""There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,"" Moore said. ""I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.""

Hill called the new research ""a call to action"" and added, ""we should be studying these policies. But unfortunately, the policies have far outpaced the science at this point.""",Legal marijuana could help offset opioid epidemic,3,CNN
story_reviews_00087,"“We thought we’d be young forever,” said Francis, who co-anchors a radio news program in Washington, D.C. “The big wake-up call is when our bodies wear down.”

Take Elliott Francis, 64, who had his second hip replacement surgery in February. Growing up, he was “a jumper and a rebounder,” he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.

For a generation that pounded its joints doing aerobics, running marathons, and carving up the ski slopes, it’s time to roll out the spare parts.

Baby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.

Advertisement

Hip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 — from 160,282 to 371,605 a year — according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.

The procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.

With millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.

“They’re aging, they’ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,” said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation’s top orthopedics centers.

The surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations — something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don’t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.

Winthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. “My goal is to get back to an hour — 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,” he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough “to be ready for golf season.”

For those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.

“I’m up and down the scaffolding all day,” said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. “My first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, ‘OK, let’s get this done.’ ”

Smith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing — on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, “I will get on the skates again.”

Like Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner.

West Newbury’s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. “I had a coupon,” he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.

Susan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston’s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.

The vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.

New England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. “Most of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,” Mattingly said.

Last year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.

Because of improvements in materials and the way they’re treated and sterilized, implants — which include polyethylene and titanium alloys — don’t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.

While physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.

But boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn’t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.

“Nobody will return to playing football,” Mattingly said. “The person who struggles is the one who’s done long-distance running for years and just doesn’t want to give it up.”

Technology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year — still a small share of the market — and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.

“The baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,” said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. “Technology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.”

Stephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was “carrying a dead tree trunk” before the surgery.

Now, she said, “I’m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day. I can run in the snow and ride my bike. I have complete range of motion . . . We want to keep going till we’re in our 80s or 90s. We don’t want to give up all the things we’re doing.”

story_reviews_00089,"""If we can keep patients engaged, we can keep them in treatment longer,"" said lead researcher Dr. Judith Tsui of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

The next phase of her research will compare a group of patients who use the monitoring app called emocha (ee-MOH-kuh) with those who don't to see if there's a difference.

At one Tennessee treatment center, some patients with opioid addiction are already using the app to upload selfies of their daily dose and answer questions about how they're doing.

""Every time they sign on, it allows us to capture data. Are they having cravings? Suicidal tendencies?"" said Scott Olson, CEO of Dallas-based Pathway Healthcare, which is trying the app at its Jackson, Tennessee, site. ""Maybe a phone call from a counselor might make the difference between staying clean and a relapse.""

Olson thinks insurers will pay for the service with more evidence. For monitoring tuberculosis patients, health departments pay roughly $35 to $50 per patient each month for systems that include encrypted data storage. A small health department might pay as little as $500 a month.

The idea of watching someone take their medicine — called directly observed therapy or DOT — has roots in tuberculosis where one person's forgetfulness can be serious for everyone. If patients don't take all their antibiotics, their infectious TB germs can get stronger, developing drug resistance and endangering the broader community.

But taking a handful of pills daily for up to a year is difficult, so public health departments traditionally sent workers to people's homes and workplaces to watch them take their doses. Today, many TB patients prefer remote monitoring. Nurses like it too.

The new uploaded selfies don't need an appointment. They are a daily routine for many tuberculosis patients in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston, where savings on mileage and worker time amounted to $100,000 in a recent year.

In Boston, Albuquerque and five other cities, researchers are studying whether the technology works for hepatitis C, a blood-borne virus that's surging among a new generation of injection drug users. New drugs for hepatitis C can cure, but they're expensive — $75,000 for a 12-week course of treatment — so insurers want to make sure patients take them.

""I think it holds a lot of promise,"" said researcher Dr. Alain Litwin of University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who's testing whether patients do better when someone watches them take their pills.

What's next? An insurer in Maryland plans to use the technology in diabetes and high blood pressure to make sure Medicare and Medicaid patients take their medicine. Startups selling the apps say they could be used by faraway adult children monitoring an elderly parent's daily pill-taking.

Experts worry about privacy, data security and penalties for poor pill-taking.

""That's the biggest ick factor,"" said Carolyn Neuhaus, a medical ethicist at the Hastings Center in New York. ""You can imagine a program where benefits are tied to compliance and the insurer says, 'We won't pay for medication anymore unless you're taking it correctly.'""

Globally, the rapid spread of smartphones creates an opportunity to eradicate TB, say the app developers.

But eliminating TB may take simpler, cheaper technologies that can be scaled for millions of cases, said Dr. Daniel Chin, who leads TB efforts for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The group supports research in China and India on two homegrown technologies. China's tool, about the size of a child's shoebox, reminds patients to take their pills and saves data for review. In India, the government favors a blister pill pack printed with phone numbers; a patient punches out a daily pill, then calls the revealed number.

Worldwide, TB kills more than 1.6 million people annually, even though most deaths are preventable with treatment.

Mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies.

The latest trial success follows Roche’s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

The Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail.

While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.

“We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.

She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers.

The world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals’ cheaper copies.

Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer.

“We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said.

“Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”",Roche's Tecentriq cocktail adds to lung cancer survival success,2,Reuters
story_reviews_00091,"The Pap test has already reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by more than 60%. Now it may become a key step in the early detection of two other gynecological malignancies — ovarian and endometrial cancers — that have been notorious killers because they’re typically caught so late.

A new study has found that by genetically analyzing the harvest of cells from a Pap smear, doctors could identify 81% of endometrial cancers and 33% of ovarian cancers. Some of those cancers were in their earliest stages, when they’re more likely to respond to treatment.

When the Johns Hopkins University researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells — a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus — they positively identified endometrial cancer in 93% of cases and ovarian cancer in 45% of cases.

And when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen, they were able to detect that deadly cancer in 63% of patients who had it.

Advertisement

“Having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting,” said Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos, a coauthor of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

It’s the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer.

While such “liquid biopsies” have not yet made their way into widespread use, they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening.

In January, the same research team presented promising findings in the journal Science on a blood test called CancerSEEK that’s capable of detecting malignancies of the liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon, lung and breast. Earlier this week, they published findings in the journal eLife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder.

As a screening test for cervical cancer, the Pap smear has been a staple of gynecological checkups for more than six decades. It’s named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection.

The Pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer, which used to be one of the most common cancers in women. However, the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer, which together kills about 25,000 women in the United States each year.

Women thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called CA-125, or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus’ endometrial wall. But those tests fail to detect many cancers, and also send up a lot of false alarms. So they’re frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms.

The result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage, when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful.

Tumor cells from ovarian and endometrial cancers shed and are carried into the uterine cavity and endocervical canal, where they can be collected with the Tao brush or the Pap brush. (Y. Wang et al. / Science Translational Medicine )

In the new study, the researchers measured the accuracy of their PapSeek test on 1,658 women. They already knew that 1,002 of the women were free of either cancer and 656 of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer.

Researchers collected cervical fluid samples with a Pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a Tao brush, which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus, nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold. Then they used the PapSeek test to sequence the samples, focusing on 18 genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers. The test also checked the samples for aneuploidy, the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells.

When the researchers used the longer Tao brush, they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but 7% of the women who had the disease, and close to half of the ovarian cancers. Combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall, these measures of “sensitivity” — the ability to detect cancers that are actually there — represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available.

When they supplemented the analysis of Pap and Tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women’s blood, they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it.

When endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages, they are easier to find with existing screening methods. But an important measure of a test’s usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized.

By that measure too, the PapSeek test looked promising. When it was used to scan the Tao brush samples, it identified 89% of the high-grade endometrial cancers in patients while their malignancy was still confined to the endometrium. It was also able to identify 80% of those with high-grade ovarian cancers before they had spread.

Just as important, the tests were remarkably good at avoiding false-positive signals, which would needlessly alarm women and lead to riskier and more-invasive tests to confirm a diagnosis. For both types of cancer, the PapSeek test’s “specificity” — its ability to accurately recognize the absence of disease — approached 100%.

Papadopoulos said he was surprised and heartened that the Pap test — or a close variant of it — could be repurposed to look for gynecological cancers that are typically caught way too late.

While the team hopes to improve the test’s sensitivity, he said that even this early version would likely boost women’s chances of earlier detection by a considerable margin.

“It doesn’t have to be perfect to help at least some women” who might otherwise die of these stealthy cancers, Papadopoulos said. “Women are already used to having Pap smears, and everyone can give a vial of blood.”

More attractive to many men than a long-acting injection or topical gel—both of which are in development—the prototype pill offers a “major step forward” in male contraception, Stephanie Page, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and senior investigator on the study, said in a statement.

The once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you'd expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives, results from an ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in Chicago, abstract show.

The prototype pill—dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU)—is somewhat similar to the combined female pill, which contains estrogen and a steroid hormone. Rather than estrogen, DMAU uses a male hormone like testosterone.

Currently available forms of testosterone can exit the body too quickly for use in a once-daily pill. The “undecanoate” in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug’s journey out of the body, Page said.

Eighty-three men took various doses of DMAU or a placebo for a month. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. They found testosterone and two hormones needed for the production of sperm were notably suppressed in men who took the highest dose of DMAU.

While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain, DMAU appeared safe. All participants passed safety tests including liver and kidney health checks.

“Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. There were no significant changes in mood or sexual function, but a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.

Page has high hopes for the results, calling them “unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.” Longer-term studies are the next step toward a once-daily male contraceptive pill, she said.",DMAU: Male Birth Control Pill Offers 'Unprecedented' Study Results,3,Newsweek

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, March 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tiny pellets could treat arthritic knee pain, delaying the need for knee replacement surgery, a small study has found.

Microparticles inserted into small blood vessels around the knee helped reduce the pain and improve function in eight arthritis sufferers, according to clinical trial results. The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.

""Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.

Bagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.

Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.

To treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.

The microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.

""It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,"" he said.

The small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.

Those eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.

Physical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.

Overall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.

Bagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.

""You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,"" he said.

Final results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.

They think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.

""Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,"" Bagla said.

Dr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure ""very promising,"" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.

""This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,"" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study. He's a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis.

Research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00095,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a fresh step on Thursday towards setting a maximum nicotine level for tobacco products in a bid to lower tobacco-related deaths across the country, saying it would collect public comment and scientific research over the next three months.

The move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. That plan marked a major shift designed to give adult smokers a wider range of alternatives, including potentially less harmful e-cigarettes.

The agency is seeking to determine a level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products that would be minimally addictive or nonaddictive, according to a draft proposal.

It hopes setting such a standard would also help prevent teenagers who experiment with tobacco from becoming addicted.

The FDA estimates that setting such a standard would help 5 million smokers quit within a year and prevent more than 33 million teens and young adults from becoming regular smokers by the year 2100.

“There is no other single action our country can take that would prevent more young people from smoking or save more lives,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

Major tobacco players such as Altria Group and British American Tobacco are grappling with sales declines in the U.S. market and hoping to recoup revenue through novel tobacco and nicotine products such as e-cigarettes.

Altria Group has partnered with Philip Morris International to sell a novel device called iQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco. The FDA is currently reviewing the iQOS application.

The FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually.

The comment period will be open through mid-June, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.

The FDA will continue to take enforcement actions against companies that inappropriately target children, including through the promotion of e-cigarettes, Gottlieb said.

James Figlar, executive vice president of research and development for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, part of British American Tobacco, said the company would work with the agency to create a path for alternative, less harmful tobacco products to reach the market.

The FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.

“We’ll also advance key parts of our tobacco plan very soon,” he said.",FDA takes fresh step towards curbing U.S. nicotine addiction,3,Reuters

TUESDAY, March 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A pill that combines three blood pressure-lowering drugs improves people's chances of lowering their high blood pressure, researchers report.

The pill contains low doses of the three medications -- telmisartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone.

The finding stems from a study of 700 people, who averaged 56 years old. All had high blood pressure.

Among those who took the so-called ""triple pill"" for six months, 70 percent had achieved their blood pressure targets, compared with 55 percent of those who received their usual care. Usual care meant taking whatever blood pressure medicine their doctor prescribed.

The rate of side effects was no greater among those who took the three-in-one pill than among the usual care group.

""Based on our findings, we conclude that this new method of using blood pressure-lowering drugs was more effective and just as safe as current approaches,"" lead author Ruth Webster said in a news release from the American College of Cardiology. She's a researcher with the George Institute for Global Health at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Orlando, Fla. The findings should be considered preliminary because research presented at meetings has not undergone the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.

""The most urgent need for innovative strategies to control blood pressure is in low- and middle-income countries,"" Webster said. ""The triple pill approach is an opportunity to 'leapfrog' over traditional approaches to care and adopt an innovative approach that has been shown to be effective.""

High blood pressure increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and kidney problems.

""A control rate of 70 percent would be a considerable improvement, even in high-income settings,"" Webster said. ""Most hypertension guidelines in these countries do not recommend combination blood-pressure-lowering therapy for initial treatment in all people.""

The findings, she said, ""should prompt reconsideration of recommendations around the use of combination therapy.""

story_reviews_00097,"A new class of drugs could be life-changing for millions of women in menopause who suffer with hot flashes.

A medication being tested in the U.K. and here in the U.S. may be the key to alleviating several of the uncomfortable menopause side effects -- and hopefully without the need for hormone replacement therapy, according to an analysis published in the journal Menopause.

""The potential for this drug class to really improve many of the symptoms of the menopause, such as hot [flashes], difficulty sleeping, weight gain, and poor concentration, is huge,"" lead author Dr. Julia Prague of the Imperial College London. ""To see the lives of our participants change so dramatically and so quickly was so exciting, and suggests great promise for the future of this new type of treatment.""

About 70 percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms -— the familiar hot flashes -- which, in some cases, last for years. This new drug, labeled MLE4901 for research, is being tested in clinical trials and offers hope for curtailing postmenopausal symptoms.

The previous ""go to"" therapy was supplemental estrogen, which proved to have side effects like blood clots or even breast cancer.

MLE4901 is taken orally and works by blocking one brain chemical called neurokinin B from binding to its receptor. The interaction between these two has been linked to the regulation of temperature in the brain when someone is deficient in estrogen—like in menopause.

""We were able to identify this new therapeutic use for the compound -- which had previously been sitting on the shelf unused -- and within three years show this type of drug may make a tangible difference to the lives of millions of women,"" Professor Waljit Dhillo, an NIHR Research Professor from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London said.

Previous studies showed that giving women an extra amount of the brain chemical neurokinin B resulted in hot flashes -- and genetic differences between people could be the reason why some have more of the chemical, or more severe postmenopausal symptoms, than others.

This small study done at the Imperial College of London involved 37 women between the ages of 40 and 62 years who did not have a period for at least 12 months, the definition of menopause, and who suffered at least seven hot flashes per day. The groups received either MLE4901 twice a day for 4 weeks, or a placebo pill on the same schedule. Two weeks later the groups swapped their treatments.

At the end of the study, those who took MLE4901 had the frequency of their hot flashes reduced by 72 percent and the severity of hot flashes decreased by 38 percent. This improvement started as early as three days after first taking the drug and relief continued for the whole month of treatment.

""We already knew this compound could be a game-changer for menopausal women, and get rid of three-quarters of their hot flushes in four weeks,"" Dhillo added. ""But this new analysis confirms the beneficial effect is obtained very quickly -- within just three days.""

Sleep and concentration improved after three days, too, which was an added bonus. The researchers noted that those improvements could have been related to the reduction in hot flashes.

All this is promising, but more research is needed and possibly a variation in the drug. A previous study on MLE4901 was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants, which resolved when they stopped taking it. They hope slightly modifying the drug may improve that side effect.

Larger studies on MLE4901 are underway in the U.S. and U.K. that will help gain an understanding of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. Like any new drug, safety and effectiveness have to be proven to the FDA before the drug can be offered in the U.S.

story_reviews_00098,"(CNN) Corey Thomas admitted to his pharmacist that he hated the blood pressure medications a previous doctor had prescribed for him. They came with ""horrible"" side effects, he said, and so he rarely took them.

As a blood pressure monitor squeezed snugly around his arm, the pharmacist counseled Thomas, 49, on his diet and stress level while checking his blood pressure. She then helped Thomas find a medication better suited for his body.

Thomas was not at a health clinic or pharmacy or a primary care physician's office.

He was at the barbershop where he works in Inglewood, California. As part of a study, these health services were provided at his barbershop and others across Los Angeles County.

The study, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine , tested whether pharmacist-led programs in barbershops could significantly lower high blood pressure in black men in the United States.

Results from six months after the study, published in March , showed that when the guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure level of less than 130/80 was achieved among 63.6% of men who participated in the study's program, versus 11.7% of those who didn't.

Results from 12 months after the study show that when guidance was coupled with medication, a blood pressure measurement of less than 130/80 was achieved by 68% of men who participated in the study program, versus 11% of those who didn't.

JUST WATCHED Check, change, and control your blood pressure Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Check, change, and control your blood pressure 02:36

""To a certain extent, I was surprised by the magnitude of the effect of the intervention,"" said Ciantel Blyler, a clinical pharmacist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles who was a co-author of the study.

""Especially once we sat down and looked at the blood pressure control rates and we were comparing the intervention group and the control group, I was sort of taken aback,"" she said.

Normal blood pressure levels for adults are 120/80 or less, and high blood pressure levels are 140/90 or higher, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Levels in between are considered at risk.

""The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats,"" the CDC says. ""The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart rests between beats.""

Many older black men tend to avoid seeing the doctor until they have a serious health problem, and then they ""use the emergency room as a doctor,"" Thomas said.

""If it wasn't for the program, a lot of guys wouldn't have known they had high blood pressure,"" he said of the study. ""Unfortunately, I wish we had other programs to come in, too.""

On the other hand, the barbershop represents a safe haven in the black community -- a no-judgment zone -- where conversations about health and other personal topics are commonplace.

As a barber, ""we know more about our customers than their spouses do,"" Thomas said.

Shape your hair and your blood pressure

The prevalence of high blood pressure among black adults in the United States is among the highest in the world, according to the American Heart Association . More than 40% of non-Hispanic black men and women have high blood pressure.

Black Americans also develop high blood pressure more often and at an earlier age than whites and Hispanics, according to the CDC.

High blood pressure, which increases risk of heart disease and stroke, affects 1.13 billion people globally , according to the World Health Organization . More than one in five adults worldwide have high blood pressure, which causes about half of all deaths from heart disease and stroke.

Barber Eric Mohammad and Mark Sims, seated, checking Sims' blood pressure for the new study.

The new study included 319 black men across 52 black-owned barbershops in California's Los Angeles County. The men, 35 to 79 years old, had systolic blood pressure of 140 or more.

The researchers randomly assigned the men, based on their barbershop, to participate in the pharmacist-led program or to a control group between February 2015 and July 2017.

In the program group, barbers encouraged the men to meet with specially trained pharmacists at the barbershop to help monitor their blood pressure. The pharmacists could prescribe drug therapy under a collaborative agreement with the men's doctors.

At his barbershop, Thomas said, many customers were hesitant to open up to the pharmacists and doctors and to meet with them for health consultations.

""No one wanted to do it,"" he said. ""But by them being there -- they were in there every day -- and then we got used to them, and they warmed up to everybody. ... Then a lot of guys eventually were like, 'I'll go. Let me make sure I'm OK.' ""

Blyler said it didn't take long for the customers to warm up to her and her colleagues.

""They understood that we were there with good intentions. It was a very comfortable environment, and folks were very welcoming, and it really worked,"" she said.

In the control group, barbers encouraged the men to make lifestyle changes and doctor appointments, but not much else changed in their usual barbershop visits.

By the end of the study, the researchers found that the barbers' role in encouraging the men to monitor and improve their health resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure, when coupled with medication from the pharmacists.

In participants assigned to the pharmacist-led program, the average reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 21.6 and 14.9 greater, respectively, than in those assigned to the control group at six months, the researchers found.

At 12 months, the average reductions were ""statistically indistinguishable"" from the six-month data, according to the researchers.

'Medical mistrust has been an important barrier'

The study had some limitations, including that it was not blind, because both participants and researchers knew who was assigned to the pharmacist-led program and who was in the control group.

Additionally, more research is needed to determine whether similar study results would occur on a national level, since the study was conducted only in the Los Angeles area.

Also, pharmacists aimed to lower blood pressure in the program participants to less than 130/80, whereas the primary care providers of those in the control group probably targeted a blood pressure of less than 140/90.

The blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 is consonant with new clinical practice guidelines that were released last year, Blyler said.

The study appears to fall in line with previous research exploring the role barbershops could have in preventing death and disease in the black community, said Dr. Joseph Ravenell, an internist at NYU Langone Health and associate professor of Population Health and Medicine at NYU School of Medicine in New York.

Ravenell was not involved in the study, but he was among the first to research how interventions in barbershops could help black men access basic health care and improve various outcomes, such as high blood pressure or even colon cancer.

In a study published in the American Journal of Public Health in August, Ravenell and his colleagues found that helping black men in barbershops through the process of registering for a colorectal cancer screening led to those men being significantly more likely to get screened over six months.

The researchers found that 17.5% of men who received help were screened, compared with 8.4% of those who didn't receive the screening help.

""Medical mistrust has been an important barrier to African-Americans seeking health care, and so the barbershop -- where men go on a monthly basis and have an opportunity to develop a rapport with a trusted key opinion leader in the community -- that rapport is a perfect foundation for talking about health,"" Ravenell said.

""We know that when it comes to people being receptive to health messages, the setting and the mood that people are in can have an impact on how open they are to receiving those messages,"" he said. ""Since the barbershop is a place where men want to be, it's a place that's known for open collegial conversation, it really is a perfect place to relay health messages that are important for black men.""

Breast cancer test kits by genetic testing company 23andMe just received Food and Drug Administration approval.

The prescription-free test is the first to report on three specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer gene mutations, according to the FDA.

By analyzing DNA collected through a saliva sample, the test detects increased risk of developing breast, ovarian or prostate cancer.

But “it has a lot of caveats,” warned Donald St. Pierre, acting director of the FDA's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. The test detects only three out of more than 1,000 known BRCA mutations. That accounts for a small percentage of people. Those most at risk of developing such cancers are of Eastern European Jewish descent.

“The test should not be used as a substitute for seeing your doctor for cancer screenings or counseling on genetic and lifestyle factors that can increase or decrease cancer risk,” he said.

These tests might help with prevention, but cannot diagnose cancer and cannot rule out your chances of getting cancer, 23andMe said.

Still, the company, which already tests DNA for other health risks as well as ancestry, said this cancer test is ""a step in the right direction.""

story_reviews_00100,"For the past several decades, Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12 steps have dominated addiction treatment in America — boasting millions of adherents and turning into the standard option within most addiction treatment programs in the US.

A new study has found, however, that AA, the original 12-step program, and others like it don’t have to be the only answer for people seeking out mutual help groups to deal with alcohol addiction.

The study, in short, looked at how people’s self-reported outcomes with AA and 12-step programs compare with the three biggest alternative mutual help groups — Women for Sobriety, SMART Recovery, and LifeRing. It concluded that these other groups perform about as well as 12-step programs.

“This study suggests that these alternatives really are viable options for people who are looking for recovery support and don’t like AA for whatever reason,” Sarah Zemore, lead author of the study, told me.

The research is by no means the last word on this question — Zemore characterized the study as the beginning of a deeper evaluation into AA alternatives.

But this is important. There has been a good amount of research into AA and the 12 steps over the years, broadly finding that about a third of people maintain recovery from alcohol addiction due to 12-step treatment, another third get something out of the treatment but not enough for full recovery, and another third get nothing at all.

Researchers have long suspected, though, that the benefits found in 12-step treatment programs are not exclusive to the 12 steps. As Zemore told me, “The benefits of 12-step groups are not driven by the 12 steps’ specific philosophy or adherence to the 12 steps. It’s really more about general mechanisms like abstinence motivation and social support for abstinence. Presumably, you could get those by participating in alternatives to AA.”

In other words, these alternatives could help the one-third to two-thirds of people who don’t get anything or much out of AA. That would help deal with a big public health issue: Based on federal data, more than 20 million people in the US have a substance use disorder, and within that group, more than 15 million have an alcohol use disorder. Excessive drinking alone is linked to 88,000 deaths each year. So finding the right solutions for this problem is literally a matter of life or death.

What the study found

The study, conducted by the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California and published last month in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, surveyed more than 600 people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), who were divided by which mutual help group they primarily participated in. Researchers followed up at six months then 12 months, measuring involvement in the groups and various substance use outcomes, including abstinence from drinking and alcohol-related problems.

After controlling for several factors, the researchers concluded that “[Women for Sobriety], LifeRing, and SMART are as effective as 12-step groups for those with AUDs.”

“Essentially, that’s the story,” Zemore said. “We were really interested in whether the effects of involvement on recovery outcomes depended on which group [participants] were in. And we found that they did not.”

There were some differences in the data. People who reported SMART as their primary group seemed to have worse substance use outcomes, and there were lower odds of total abstinence among LifeRing members.

That might have something to do with differences in recovery goals. For example, AA really emphasizes total abstinence from drinking as the solution to alcohol addiction. Groups like SMART and LifeRing, meanwhile, can be friendlier to the idea of members moderating their drinking but not quitting altogether. That could affect substance use outcomes — and especially abstinence outcomes.

The study’s survey data suggests this is in fact what was going on: When researchers controlled for people’s recovery goals — meaning, whether they wanted to commit to lifetime total abstinence or not — the differences between the 12-step groups, SMART, and LifeRing went away.

“That suggests that people with less commitment to lifetime total abstinence are more likely to participate in SMART and LifeRing than they are to participate in 12-step groups,” Zemore said. “That’s why you’re seeing these associations between SMART and LifeRing affiliation at baseline and worse recovery outcomes when you control for involvement.” She added, “But I want to emphasize that these go away when you control for recovery goals.”

Again, the study is not the final word. John Kelly, an addiction researcher at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study, told me that the study is “good news, in general,” but pointed out that it’s limited by its methodology: It’s based on an online survey, not the kind of randomized trial that’s typically the gold standard in research. That may have led to some potentially biased results — perhaps participants in specific groups were less likely to report bad outcomes, for instance.

And since it’s only one study, it’s possible that the results were biased in some other way. So it’s up to future research to verify the findings.

One tricky thing with this line of research is you can’t really force people to participate in certain groups — so studies that randomly assign participants to AA, SMART, LifeRing, or Women for Sobriety may not be easy to do. But there are ways that researchers could get around these problems, such as only using participants who are willing to try different groups and actively following up with them to make sure they are actually participating.

Another big research question: figuring out why, exactly, these groups might work to help people stay alcohol- or drug-free. There’s good research into how AA works, but it’d be good to figure out if SMART, LifeRing, and Women for Sobriety work in a similar way. That, Zemore said, will be one of her goals in future studies.

Why we need alternatives

In discussions about addiction treatment, AA and the 12 steps tend to prompt polarizing reactions — some people swear by the programs, others absolutely hate them.

There’s a good explanation for that: While the research shows that 12-step treatment can be as effective as professional treatment modalities like cognitive behavioral therapy, the research also shows that the 12 steps don’t work for everyone.

As one example, a prominent complaint about 12-step programs is the spiritual aspect. This is a big part of the 12 steps, with the final step even invoking “a spiritual awakening.” For people who aren’t religious or spiritual, this can be a big turn-off; that’s one reason SMART and LifeRing exist to begin with — they’re meant to be secular alternatives to the 12 steps.

The good news is that the research suggests the spiritual aspect doesn’t fully explain why the 12 steps are effective for some people. Instead, it seems other traits are just as, if not more, important — such as the social support that AA meetings provide and the lessons that participants can pick up at meetings.

That’s long led researchers to suspect that alternative mutual help groups could work. If so, that would let some people go to AA meetings if they prefer the 12 steps, while others could find SMART, LifeRing, Women for Sobriety, or something else that works for them. Basically, everyone could find a workable solution.

Providing these alternatives would essentially move addiction treatment closer to other kinds of medical problems. As Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University, previously told me, “We don’t have anything that works for everybody. There’s very few places in medicine where you do.” So there need to be as many alternatives as possible.

The US is far from that at the moment. Most treatment facilities in America are, according to the survey data and research, at least partly based on the 12 steps — making it the only option for many people. While alternatives like SMART or LifeRing do exist, they’re not nearly as available as AA — and they certainly aren’t built into professional treatment programs in the same way as the 12 steps.

As Albert, a pseudonym for an AA member in Georgia, previously told me, “There’s just not a lot of widely advertised options available.” AA and 12-step treatment are “the most well-known and most recommended option, so that’s kind of where you tend to go.”

Zemore’s study begins to peel away at this problem. By showing that there really might be other effective options out there, the research provides hope that there may be a better — or at least more complete — solution out there for alcohol addiction.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR

People who are diagnosed with prediabetes can delay or prevent the disease if they change their lifestyle and lose a significant amount of weight. But here's the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.

""Just telling people to do things doesn't work,"" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn't be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.

Omada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You'll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)

""Week by week we have lessons on different themes, "" Duffy explains. ""They're interactive, and there's little games"" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they're led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. ""We call it the symphony effect,"" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.

Getting started

Sometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He's also the chef at the inn. ""I'm immersed in food all day,"" Speranza says.

Last year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. ""It was like a gut punch, "" Speranza says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Don Speranza Courtesy of Don Speranza

Based on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.

""It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,"" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.

When he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.

""Oh, my coach, "" Speranza says. ""I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive."" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.

He realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. ""Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,"" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.

Speranza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.

Instead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.

""Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, "" Speranza says. ""It was a game changer.""

The weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. ""Now, I'll start the coffee,"" he says, but before he drinks it, ""I'll go outside and walk."" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.

""Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,"" Speranza says with a laugh.

Since last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.

""I feel so much better,"" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. ""Now, when I look at [the sacks] I'm aghast to think that's what I was carrying around.""

Success is not automatic

Not every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult

""I'm still on the journey to get to more optimal, health"" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn't get the personal support he would have liked from the program. ""For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, 'Hey, we noticed you didn't step on the scale,' "" he says. ""For some reason that didn't get escalated to the coach."" So he says that was a disappointment.

Overall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. ""I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,"" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.

There is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That's promising, because there's evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.

""This is one of the most exciting things,"" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.

Omada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a ""health transformation team"" that is data and tech-driven.

Additionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.

Greenwood says he'd like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.

story_reviews_00102,"Chemotherapy is administered to a cancer patient via intravenous drip in Durham, N.C. IVs are one of the most common things in health care.

New research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Using a different intravenous fluid instead of the usual saline greatly reduced the risk of death or kidney damage, two large studies found.

The difference could mean 50,000 to 70,000 fewer deaths and 100,000 fewer cases of kidney failure each year in the U.S., researchers estimate. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.

“We’ve been sounding the alarm for 20 years” about possible harms from saline, said Dr. John Kellum, a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s purely inertia” that prevents a change, he said.

Kellum had no role in the two studies, which were discussed Tuesday at a critical care conference in San Antonio and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants helped pay for the work.

IVs are one of the most common things in health care. They are used to prevent dehydration, maintain blood pressure, or give patients medicines or nutrients if they can’t eat.

Saline — salt dissolved in water — has been the most widely used fluid in the U.S. for more than a century even as evidence has emerged that it can harm kidneys, especially when used a lot.

Other IV solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also contain potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. They’re widely used in Europe and Australia.

The studies involved 28,000 patients at Vanderbilt University who were given IVs of saline or a balanced fluid. For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.

Since there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the U.S. alone each year, “there are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline,” said one study leader, Vanderbilt’s Dr. Matthew Semler.

After seeing the results two months ago, Vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. The University of Pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, Kellum said.

The fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.

IV fluids have been in the news since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by Baxter International (BAX), one of the biggest makers of these fluids. The shortage has eased, but some supply issues remain.

story_reviews_00103,"(Reuters Health) - People who get minimally-invasive surgery to replace damaged heart valves have an easier time completing daily tasks and a better quality of life after the procedure, a research review suggests.

The analysis focused on people with what’s known as aortic stenosis, which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow, forcing it to work much harder to pump blood. The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.

Patients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn’t require cutting open the chest.

Afterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.

In addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.

The results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.

“These symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient’s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,” Cohen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

“By replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her ‘normal’ quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,” Cohen said by email.

Overall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.

Participants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.

The smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.

One limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.

People who don’t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.

Surgeons may also perform what’s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.

Results of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

“Replacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,” Kapadia, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.”

The method—detailed in a paper published on Monday, February 19, in the Nature journal Biomedical Engineering— involves analyzing blood vessels in an area of the eye called the retinal fundus.

The researchers from Verily, formerly known as Google Life Sciences, developed the algorithm in the hope of making accurate assessments of patients’ cardiovascular health more quickly and easily than current methods.

Training deep-learning models on data from more than a quarter of a million patients, the scientists were able to predict the cardiovascular risk factors that were not previously thought to be present in retinal fundus images.

The risk factors include the person’s gender, smoking status, blood pressure and age—estimated to within four years of the patient’s actual age.

“Most cardiovascular risk calculators use some combination of these parameters to identify patients at risk of experiencing either a major cardiovascular event or cardiac-related mortality within a pre-specified time period, such as 10 years,” the paper states.

“However, some of these parameters may be unavailable… We therefore explored whether additional signals for cardiovascular risk can be extracted from retinal images, which can be obtained quickly, cheaply and non-invasively in an outpatient setting.”

More than 300 million people worldwide have depression, according to the World Health Organization, of which less than half recieve effective treatments. In many countries, the rate drops to less than 10 percent.

In the U.S., the National Institute of Mental Health estimates 16.2 million adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2016. Approximately 37 percent of these people received no treatment.

In the U.K, where a number of the study authors are based, at least one million more people could benefit from drugs or psychotherapy, senior author John Geddes said.

Some drugs more effective than others

The researchers analyzed existing studies of 21 different drugs, and found some were much more effective than others.

Drugs ranged from more than one third more effective than a placebo to more than twice as effective. The best performers included amitriptyline and escitalopram, while the worst included fluoxetine—commonly sold under the trade name Prozac—and reboxetine, which is not approved for sale in the U.S.

A complex treatment picture

The results add up to a complex treatment picture for what authors called “one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults.”

Antidepressants do not improve symptoms in about 40 percent of people, study author Andrea Cipriani of Oxford University told a press briefing.

While these results should reassure many people with depression that antidepressants can be effective, “this does not necessarily mean antidepressants should always be the first line of treatment,” he said.

Talking therapies are thought to be about as effective as antidepressant medication, but these are often much more expensive.

Experts not involved in the research agreed the results were significant.

Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the U.K.’s Royal College of GPs, expressed concern about the stigma surrounding antidepressant use.

She said in a statement: “Taking antidepressants is frequently portrayed as a negative thing or something done only when other therapies are not available or have failed, but this in itself can add to the unfortunate stigma that sometimes exists around people with mental health conditions.”

But she also urged caution. “Although antidepressants are of proven benefit—as this study shows,” she said, “no doctor wants their patients to become reliant on medication.”

Putting a long-held controversy to bed

Carmine Pariante, a professor at the UK’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the study ""finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants.""

story_reviews_00106,"Blood and urine test, believed to be first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders

Scientists in Britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children.

Researchers at the University of Warwick said the test, believed to be the first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives.

ASDs mainly affect a person’s social interaction and communication, with symptoms that can include speech disturbances, repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty adapting to new environments.

As there is a wide range of ASD symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain, particularly at the early stages of development. It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.

Scientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).

Genetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.

They also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.

The Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.

The Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.

They said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.

The research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: “Our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.

“With further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles – or ‘fingerprints’ – of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.”

The research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.

• Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: “This is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don’t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism. Still, the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation, which takes into account the many features of autism.”","New test can detect autism in children, scientists say",1,Autism

There are about 2.8 million concussion-related hospital visits every year

(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has, for the first time, approved a blood test to help detect concussion in adults.

The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures two biomarkers: proteins known as UCH-L1 and GFAP that are released upon injury to the brain and pass through the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels of the proteins can be detected within 15 or 20 minutes of injury. The test can be taken within 12 hours of injury, and results can be obtained within three or four hours.

Patients are currently diagnosed with concussion based on a combination of symptoms as well as imaging. However, CT scans don't always detect concussion.

""Over 90% of CT scans (for concussion) are negative. And you get 200 times the radiation of a chest X-ray. It's expensive; it's not terrific,"" said Hank Nordhoff, chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers, maker of the new test. It can help determine whether a patient further needs a CT scan, based on a physician's concerns.

story_reviews_00108,"""Remarkable"" -- that’s how researchers are describing the results of a new study done on mice displaying traits associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The deletion of just a single enzyme saw the near total reversal of the deposition of amyloid plaques found in brains of those with Alzheimer's, improving cognitive functions in the mouse subjects, according to the study from researchers at the Cleveland Clinic, published Feb. 14 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.

These promising research findings center around deleting a gene that produces an enzyme called BACE1, which helps make the beta-amyloid peptides that accumulate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme’s activity dramatically reduces production of beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms -- including memory loss -- associated with Alzheimer's.

By using BACE1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme's levels, researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice, offering hope for human subjects down the line, according to the study.

Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research via Journal of Experimental Medicine

However, researchers urge caution with the results as many Alzheimer’s discoveries seem to hold true in mice, then fail in people.

Cleveland Clinic researcher Riqiang Yan, Ph.D., an author on the study, told ABC News that in the mouse model, the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted, completely stopping the enzyme's production. But in humans, it’s unlikely that BACE1 inhibitors would totally halt the enzyme's production, Yan said.

Nonetheless, five BACE1 inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently, Yan added.

“BACE1 inhibitors are still hopeful for AD patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for long-term use,” Yan said.

Yan added researchers are currently in phase II and, in some cases, phase III clinical trials for the various compounds.

story_reviews_00109,"A Japanese drug company is offering up a big claim: Shionogi & Co. says it has an experimental pill that can kill the flu virus within a single day, according to news reports.

In a clinical trial, a single dose of the drug made by the pharmaceutical company eliminated the virus from people's bodies in a median time of 24 hours, The Wall Street Journal reported. Both Japanese and American flu patients were included in the trial.

The experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug, Tamiflu, the company told the Journal.

The drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications. The flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells. Once inside a cell, it hijacks the cell's machinery, forcing the cell to make copies of the virus. Then, the newly copied viruses break out of the cell, spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process.

This flu season could be worst in a decade

Existing drugs, including Tamiflu, work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell, the Journal reported. The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.

Japanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported. The drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the U.S. this summer; however, the drug likely wouldn't be available here until next year.

story_reviews_00110,"Researchers have developed an ultraviolet (UV) lamp that kills the influenza virus but isn’t harmful to human skin or eyes, according to a new study in Scientific Reports. They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.

“We’ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,” says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization — for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.

But conventional germicidal lamps aren’t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. “So up until now, they’re only really practical when people aren’t around,” say Brenner. “You can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone’s inside.”

About five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can’t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.

“We wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,” says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. “We haven’t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we’ve always seen lots of biological damage,” he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.

Now, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.

“We think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,” says Brenner. “Think about doctor’s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes—any place where there’s a likelihood for airborne viruses.” And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.

Brenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. “The lamp we’re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,” he says. “We don’t see cost as being a limiting factor here.”

UVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well — in the operating room during surgeries, for example. “No matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,” says Brenner. “If you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.”

Brenner can’t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he’s “extremely optimistic” about the technology. “There has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.”

MONDAY, Feb. 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As a particularly nasty flu season rages across the United States, scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes ""light"" work of the virus.

Researchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light -- called far-UVC -- easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people.

It could offer a new, inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, airports and aircraft, said the team from Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.

The disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner.

But he believes ""the use of overhead, low-level far-UVC light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis.""

As the researchers explained, broad-spectrum UVC light kills viruses and bacteria, and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment. But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces.

However, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.

In prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous ""superbug"" -- without harming human or mouse skin.

In this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.

""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research.

However, ""because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,"" he said in a university news release.

Lamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.

""And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,"" he said.

Two flu experts were encouraged by the findings.

""The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,"" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.

""Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,"" Grosso said. ""Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.""

Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.

He noted that the technology's cost ""is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses.""

The findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports.

story_reviews_00112,"Gone With A Shot? Hopeful New Signs Of Relief For Migraine Sufferers

Enlarge this image toggle caption Photographer is my life/Getty Images Photographer is my life/Getty Images

Humans have suffered from migraines for millennia. Yet, despite decades of research, there isn't a drug on the market today that prevents them by targeting the underlying cause. All of that could change in a few months when the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce its decision about new therapies that have the potential to turn migraine treatment on its head.

The new therapies are based on research begun in the 1980s showing that people in the throes of a migraine attack have high levels of a protein called calcitonin gene–related peptide, or CGRP, in their blood.

Step by step, researchers tracked and studied this neurochemical's effects. They found that injecting the peptide into the blood of people prone to migraines triggers migraine-like headaches, whereas people not prone to migraines experienced, at most, mild pain. Blocking transmission of CGRP in mice appeared to prevent migraine-like symptoms. And so a few companies started developing a pill that might do the same in humans.

Clinical trials of the first pills were effective against migraine but halted in 2011 over concerns about potential liver damage. So, four pharmaceutical companies rejiggered their approach. To bypass the liver, all four instead looked to an injectable therapy called monoclonal antibodies — tiny immune molecules most commonly used to treat cancer. Not only do these bypass the liver to block CGRP, but one injection appears to be effective for up to three months with almost no noticeable side effects.

Two manufacturers, Amgen (in collaboration with Novartis) and Teva Pharmaceuticals, have completed clinical trials and expect to hear from the FDA by June whether the therapies have been approved. Two more companies, Eli Lilly and Alder Biopharmaceuticals, plan to file for FDA approval later this year.

Current treatments don't always work

It's been a long time coming. Right now, the only available preventive treatments are accidental discoveries: A number of people prescribed medications for depression, high blood pressure and epilepsy discovered migraine relief, too. Now, many of those drugs, including propranolol and topiramate, have been tested and approved for migraine. But no one drug works for everyone, and side effects can prove intolerable or downright unpleasant.

Migraines are throbbing, one-sided headaches that can be accompanied by nausea as well as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, and movement. At their best, the headaches are an annoyance. At their worst, they can be completely debilitating. So for those of us who get numerous migraines each month, the prospect of a new approach feels almost life-changing.

According to one recent survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women in the U.S. reported having had a migraine in the last three months. And up to 2 percent of all Americans has at least 15 migraine days every single month. The toll such pain can take on health, morale, and productivity is substantial.

My own migraines started when I was 13. They struck a few times a week and I thought they were normal headaches. For a while, I tried the usual over the counter pain relievers but, one by one, they stopped working. By age 25, I started to wonder if there was something seriously wrong with my head. My general practitioner diagnosed me with migraines, gave me my first preventive medication — an antidepressant — then sent me to see a specialist.

Since that day more than 17 years ago, I have tried six preventive prescription medications. Not one helped. I alternated among four different, neurologist-recommended supplements, all to no avail. I received bi-monthly injections of magnesium and participated in one of the first clinical trials of Botox. And while Botox seemed to decrease my migraines by one or two per month, it wasn't enough to bother fighting about it with a new insurance company. I exercised regularly. I experimented with an elimination diet that left me eating nothing but broccoli and white rice, but still the migraines came. I averaged about 15 to 20 each month.

Still, I considered myself lucky. The headaches almost never came with nausea, and I had medications that typically ousted them within an hour or two. All told, I usually lost only a few hours of productivity a week.

When I grew older and had two children, my body changed and my migraines changed, too. I get them less frequently now, but when they come, they can stick around for a few days or even a week. Abortive medications still work, except when they don't. So when I heard about a new approach that was making its way through a number of pharmaceutical company pipelines, I began combing through the national clinical trials database to find a trial near me. I found one about 80 miles away, which didn't seem too far a trek considering the tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life. I made an appointment.

Clinical trials seem promising

Neurologist David Dodick, at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, has been involved in multiple clinical trials with each of the four anti-CGRP antibody treatments in development. And, he admits, he's optimistic. He has good reason to be: Each of the therapies decreases migraine frequency by at least one to two days per month. ""In a field where, over time, the progress and pace of research in understanding the underlying biology and mechanism of disease has been slow, this was very exciting,"" he says.

Because migraines are not life-threatening, most drugs have to pass a pretty high bar to be approved. And so far, patients on the experimental treatments report limited side effects that consist mostly of pain at the injection site. Unlike the current preventive medications, there is no nausea, no fuzzy thinking, no nerve pain, no weight loss or gain. And instead of remembering to take a daily pill, there is just a once-monthly injection.

Neurologists already have patients eager to test these therapies, especially when everything else they've tried hasn't worked. ""There's a big hole to fill, both in prevention and acute therapies,"" says Alexander Mauskop, director of the New York Headache Center in New York City. (Disclosure: He's my former neurologist.) ""If I have someone who's really suffering and can't find a solution, I tell them that in June I might have something new for them to try."" Right now, he says, he has a list of about two dozen such patients.

High price tag

Even if the new therapies are approved, however, patients may still have to jump through a number of hoops to get them. Biologic therapies like these are expensive, and treatment could reportedly range anywhere from $8,000 to $18,000 a year. At that price, Mauskop and other neurologists expect insurance companies to require patients to have tried just about everything else first.

The other hitch at this stage is a lack of long-term safety data. ""If someone is well-controlled with Botox or another drug, I'd not suggest they switch,"" Mauskop says. ""With Vioxx, it took 10 years before they discovered that it increased the risk of heart problems.""

Side effects are a potential concern. Elizabeth Loder, chief of headache at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, points out that because CGRP constricts blood vessels, there may be potential long-term effects on blood pressure or other cardiovascular function. In women of childbearing age, who are the ones most prone to frequent migraines, ""you can imagine that might have effects on fertility or placental function.""

Right now, the longest patients have been on one of these new therapies is one to two years.

I ask Mauskop whether he'd recommend I enroll in a clinical trial, given my failure to respond to most everything else. He pauses, noting that he's no longer my neurologist and that he can't really give me any suggestions. But then he says that, since I'd previously shown some response to Botox, perhaps I might want to give it another try. I think about my two young children and my risk tolerance. Perhaps in 10 years I'll feel differently. For now, however, I pick up the phone and cancel my clinical trial appointment.

TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating the brain with an implantable device may be safe -- and possibly helpful -- for some people with Alzheimer's disease, a small pilot study suggests.

In what researchers described as a ""proof of concept"" treatment, three Alzheimer's patients had deep brain stimulation (DBS) wires implanted in the brain -- in areas related to skills like planning, judgment and problem-solving.

Over the next 18 months or more, the tactic appeared to be safe. And there were ""signals"" that it was slowing down two of the patients' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.

Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson's disease and certain other brain disorders.

But it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed.

""This is not ready for prime time,"" he said. ""It's not something patients can ask their neurologist for.""

Keith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed.

It's ""much too early"" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.

Instead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is ""a reasonable route"" to study in larger clinical trials.

The results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a ""brain pacemaker,"" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain ""circuits.""

The theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer's patients, Scharre said, is similar to the ""use it or lose it"" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.

Right now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory.

But Alzheimer's impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.

So, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's and were on standard medications.

After starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer's research database.

Two of the DBS patients declined at a ""meaningfully"" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.

That patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she'd regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.

In a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer's has progressed, but more slowly than he'd expected.

""LaVonne has had Alzheimer's disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it's really a positive thing because it shows that we're doing something right,"" Moore said.

If DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer's, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.

It would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.

In the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.

There is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.

What's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.

On a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: ""Alzheimer's disease is more than just amnesia.""

For caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging. So any new therapies that help address those issues would be welcome.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's -- a number that could rise to 16 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association.

story_reviews_00116,"Many of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.

Could oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.

AD

AD

""These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,"" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. ""Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.""

But other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.

""People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,"" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.

Compressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.

AD

MTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.

Patients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.

The nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.

AD

AD

""Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,"" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.

Patients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.

Researchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.

AD

AD

Efrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. ""A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,"" he said, ""they are the same basic thing.""

Efrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal — a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet — and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.

As the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars — the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance — on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs — reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million — of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.

AD

AD

Overall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. ""It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,"" Harch said.

A few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.

While the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.

Ziad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.

One of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.

Over the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. ""I felt completely hopeless,"" she said.

AD

Then Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt ""perfect."" ""It was a complete 180,"" she said. ""This treatment saved my life.""

Cook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. ""Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,"" Pathak said.

But a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she ""got suddenly and rather miraculously better,"" Pathak said.

Of course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. ""Definitely, we need more science,"" he said. ""We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.""

“These striking results will have an immediate impact and save people from lifelong disability or death,” Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said in a statement. “I really cannot overstate the size of this effect.”

The key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot. Traditional guidelines have set a limit of six hours after stroke symptoms begin, and said after that it would be too late to help.

The study showed that the time window could be expanded to 16 hours. However, the findings do not apply to every stroke victim.

story_reviews_00118,"A treatment is offering hope for millions of patients with sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing when they're asleep. An estimated 22 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea, putting them at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke and memory loss. Patients who are older, overweight and male are generally most at-risk, reports CBS News correspondent David Begnaud.

""I wasn't breathin'. I wasn't getting the correct amount of oxygen. My thought process had gone,"" said Peggy Siravo. Her memory got so bad, her family thought she had dementia. Exhausted, the 59-year-old could barely do her job as a nurse – and she knew something wasn't right.

""I knew I was in trouble,"" Siravo said.

Siravo has severe obstructive sleep apnea, where her throat muscles relax, blocking her airway and disrupting her sleep. On average, she stops breathing 53 times an hour, that's nearly once every minute during a night's sleep. She said on a night, she could be up four hours and sleep two.



She did not find relief from the CPAP machine, a common treatment that delivers constant pressurized air. She even needed oxygen on top of that.



""And then that didn't work. That's when they introduced me to Inspire and saved my life,"" Siravo said.

""Inspire"" is an FDA-approved pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest. It senses when breathing slows down and sends an electrical pulse to the tongue to stimulate it forward, keeping the airway open.



""This has been revolutionary. It's been a game changer,"" Dr. Maurits Boon said. He is Siravo's doctor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.



""She'd given up. And she had memory issues, she was miserable,"" Boon said. ""This is not a benign disease… it actually shortens people's lives.""

A few months after having the Inspire device implanted, Siravo went to a sleep lab to see how it was working. They ran tests throughout the night. Early the next morning, Boon revealed the results.



""So before we activated the device, we have all sorts of problems… This is basically your brain saying, 'I'm not breathing.' … And after we activate the device it's perfect,"" Boon explained. ""Look at your oxygen. Nice, stable, flat line, staying around 96-97 percent. So this is good as it gets.""

""Okay,"" Siravo said.

""And as far as I'm concerned, this is a cure. This is awesome,"" Boon said.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 68 percent of patients experienced less sleep apnea after getting the implant.



For years, all Siravo and her husband, David, wanted was a good night's rest – and now they're finally getting it. Every night, Siravo turns on the implant before heading to bed.



""What's it like to sleep now?"" Begnaud asked.

""Great. Turn myself on. I go to sleep,"" Siravo said. ""And then I get up. And I turn myself off. And I have a normal day like you and everybody else.""

""Doesn't work for everybody. But man, it worked for you,"" Begnaud said.

""It sure did. It saved my life,"" Siravo said.

Inspire is not for everyone. It's only for moderate to severe cases, and like any surgery, there is risk of infection. For Siravo, she said her memory is back to 100 percent. The device costs around $20,000 not including the surgery.","Sleep apnea patient finds rest with implant device: ""It saved my life""",1,CBS News

Enlarge this image Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images

Researchers say they have taken a step toward developing a blood test that would detect eight common cancers, possibly even before symptoms appear.

As they report Thursday in the journal Science, they're hoping their idea would eventually lead to a $500 test that can screen for cancer and identify people with the disease when it's in its earliest stages and more treatable.

But they have a long way to go.

There have been many attempts over the decades to develop blood tests to screen for cancers. Some look for proteins in the blood that appear with cancer. Others more recently have focused on DNA from tumors. But these methods alone don't give reliable results.

So Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology and pathology at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, collaborated with many colleagues at the medical school to develop a new approach. It combines two methods into one test.

Their experimental test, dubbed CancerSEEK, focuses on eight major cancers: lung, breast, colon, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary and esophagus.

""We selected those eight cancers based on how frequent they are, also [because] a lot of them do not have any screening modality right now,"" Papadopoulos says.

The researchers looked at 1,005 people who had been diagnosed with these cancers. The blood test found signs of cancer in about 70 percent of them.

They also looked at 812 people without cancer diagnoses and found just seven of them — less than 1 percent — apparently had a false reading that found cancer. A low false-positive rate is critical for any test that could be used widely to screen people for cancer.

Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. And that percentage could well be lower than the 70 percent average. For example, the test was successful only about 40 percent of the time in the patients the researchers studied with the earliest stage 1 cancers.

Though 40 percent success would be far from ideal, ""we still think this is a very important milestone in detecting cancers in asymptomatic people,"" Papadopoulos says. ""That could save their life.""

""I am incredibly excited by this new paper,"" says Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah who was not involved in the study. ""This is the paper that's going to set the field in motion.""

But Schiffman points out that there are many issues to work out – even assuming the test proves reliable among people who have not been previously diagnosed with cancer. For instance, if the success rate is around 40 percent at detecting cancer, that means it misses cancers more often than it finds it.

""The thing we worry about quite often is ... if we have a test result that is negative we don't want to give false reassurance to the patient,"" he says. He is concerned that patients will think to themselves, ""Even though I have this weird stomach pain that won't go away, I know it's not cancer. I'm not going to go to the doctor because the CancerSEEK test told me it was negative,"" Schiffman says. ""And that would be a terrible thing.""

Another problem is that the test results find signs of cancer, but often fail to pinpoint which part of the body is affected. ""That's a tremendous problem that has to be overcome,"" he says.

""We've come about one step in a thousand-mile journey,"" says Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University who was not involved in the study.

First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys.

And for the test to be useful, ""you've got to find cancer that's going to otherwise be lethal, and not cancer that would otherwise be destined to do nothing,"" Prasad says.

That's been a huge problem with previous cancer screening tests, especially for prostate cancer and breast cancer, and has led to pointless and potentially dangerous treatments, he says.

An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.

""We want this to be true, we hope that this is true, but we have learned through 30, 40, 50 years of cancer screening that we have to do the right studies at the outset to know that it's true,"" Prasad says.

The scientists at Hopkins have already launched their next study, which could involve tens of thousands of apparently healthy volunteers who are enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. Their experience will help answer the next big question, which is whether CancerSEEK will pick up cancer in people who don't have symptoms.

If that multiyear experiment succeeds, the researchers will still have to demonstrate that the test improves and extends the lives of cancer patients.

Papadopoulos is less concerned that the test could detect cancers that might not in fact benefit from treatment.

""In a personal level, I do want to know,"" he says. ""That doesn't mean I have to go and have a surgery. However, I still think this is very useful information, knowing that something is happening and follow it up.""

As for the cost of the test, Papadopoulos says the research team has tried hard to make it affordable. They're hoping to make it economical, so that each test could cost about $500. But he says Johns Hopkins holds the patent and has not licensed it as yet to a company that would ultimately set the price.

HealthDay Reporter

THURSDAY, Jan. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Injecting a calcium-based cement into the bones of some people with knee or hip pain could help them avoid joint replacement surgery, Ohio State University doctors say.

The calcium phosphate cement flows into the spongy inside portion of the bone, filling in microfractures and other damaged areas, and it hardens in about 10 minutes' time, said Dr. Kelton Vasileff, an orthopedic surgeon at the university's Wexner Medical Center.

The cement braces the bruised or injured joint bone from the inside, Vasileff explained, and eventually is replaced by new bone as part of the body's natural healing process.

The procedure, called subchondroplasty, has been available to people with knee problems for years, Vasileff said. Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.

It is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.

The procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.

However, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.

""People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,"" Vasileff said. ""But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis. In these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that, this could be an alternative.""

Software engineer Ben Wallace underwent subchondroplasty in November to help shore up a damaged hip.

""The end of September I noticed I was really struggling to move around my left leg very well,"" said Wallace, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape, with a misshapen femur.

A five-hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement.

""It's been going really great. I'm better than what they expected. One week after surgery I was off the crutches, walking on my own,"" Wallace said.

""I figured I'm going to have a fake hip in there at the age of 30, which was very depressing,"" Wallace explained. ""The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.""

Subchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be ""oversold"" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.

""The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,"" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.

""It's just important not to oversell this,"" he added.

The best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow ""overloaded"" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.

""If you inject this substance into the bone, you're basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,"" Hepinstall noted.

""The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you're injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient's own anatomy,"" Hepinstall continued.

""But there's a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,"" he stressed.

""We don't want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they're all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,"" Hepinstall said. ""This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.""

Younger adolescents in the study showed bigger improvements in their cholesterol and inflammation levels than the older teens. Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.

Nearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.

The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.

""If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,"" Raghuveer says. ""They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.""

Among 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.

The teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.

The risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.

Three years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.

Before surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants — 83 percent — had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.

""One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,"" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. ""And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,"" Lenhard says. ""The results were impressive.""

The study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the ""odds are very good"" that they would, and Raghuveer ""would be cautiously optimistic"" that the findings would be similar regardless of sex or ethnicity.

The population also included only teens with the greatest obesity who were also unsuccessful trying other weight loss methods.

""Severe obesity is notoriously difficult to treat with anything other than surgery,"" Lenhard says. ""The results of this study suggest that performing surgery at a BMI even lower than 52 would provide even better outcomes.""

An estimated 1,600 adolescents undergo metabolic or bariatric surgeries each year, the study notes, but families should only consider such procedures after exhausting other treatment options.

""This is not a procedure you would consider for any obese patient who walks through the door,"" Raghuveer says. ""It would be considered for the highly obese and those not responding to any behavioral modifications, physical activity or calorie restriction.""

Before undergoing bariatric surgery, teens and their families receive extensive counseling, Michalsky says.

""Teens considering bariatric surgery should have a frank discussion with their family and primary care provider and seek detailed information from well-established bariatric surgery centers that are specifically dedicated to treating adolescents,"" he adds.

All three procedures carry the same risks as any surgical procedure, such as infections, blood clots and bleeding, Lenhard said, and a common risk of sleeve gastrectomy is bleeding where the stomach is reconnected. People who have a gastric bypass often have nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, Lenhard said. And gastric banding has low effectiveness and a risk of the band slipping down the stomach.

Getting longer term data is important, too. Three years is a good follow-up time for this type of study, and it has many more participants than similar studies.

""However, three years is not a long time overall in the life of a child,"" Raghuveer says. ""I'd be curious what happens to these kids at 10 years, 15 years later.""

Michalsky says the study is ongoing, and they expect to continuing gathering information for years to come.

Ideally, public health efforts should aim for better obesity prevention, including parent education and interventions when children are toddlers and preschoolers, according to Raghuveer. ""A generational divide"" has left fewer families knowing how to fix meals, she says, and more families need to learn to cook and avoid packaged foods and microwave dinners.

""The big question is, how do we prevent obese kids from getting to this point where they would need an invasive surgical procedure?"" Raghuveer says. ""The bigger message should be that we should get to a point in society where we are not managing obesity, but we are preventing obesity.""

Spark Therapeutics set the price for the gene therapy at $425,000 per eye

(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye.

Spark Therapeutics Inc., the Philadelphia-based maker of voretigene neparvovec, announced Wednesday in a statement that it reached an agreement in principle with Harvard Pilgrim and affiliates of Express Scripts to make the one-time treatment available to patients with a rare genetic defect that often leads to blindness.

The mutation affects both eyes, usually at the same pace, so most patients would need treatment for both eyes, a Spark Therapeutics spokeswoman said.

In some cases, the gene therapy will be available under an ""outcomes-based rebate arrangement."" The company also stated that its proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government program that covers about 100 million Americans, would allow installment payments for the drug.

""For a one-time therapy, like Luxturna, a non-traditional payment and distribution model is necessary to ensure needs of all parties -- patients, payers and providers -- are addressed,"" said Jennifer Luddy, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts.

story_reviews_00126,"(Reuters Health) - People who drink hot tea daily may be less likely than others to develop glaucoma symptoms, U.S. researchers say.

Compared to coffee, soft drink and iced tea drinkers, study participants who consumed a cup or more of hot caffeinated tea daily had 74 percent lower odds of having glaucoma, the study authors report in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

“Glaucoma can lead to blindness, and it would be great if it could be prevented because there is no cure,” said lead author Dr. Anne Coleman of the University of California, Los Angeles.

“The best way to prevent it is to get your eyes checked,” Coleman told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “But we are also interested in lifestyle habits and what we can do to make a difference.”

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, affecting an estimated 58 million people. That includes more than three million Americans, only half of whom are aware they have the disease, according to the Glaucoma Research Foundation.

Coffee, or caffeine in general have previously been linked to increased glaucoma risk, although recent studies don’t agree, Coleman and her colleagues write.

To evaluate the relationship between specific caffeinated drinks and glaucoma, Coleman and colleagues analyzed data on a sample of more than 10,000 people in the U.S. who were representative of the entire population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2005-2006 answered questions about their diets and lifestyles, had medical exams and blood tests and also underwent eye examinations.

About 1,700 participants were over age 40, had no other known eye diseases and had full eye examination results from the survey. In this group, Coleman’s team found that just over 5 percent, 82 people, had glaucoma.

Almost half of participants reported drinking coffee often, but less than 10 percent drank hot tea daily. The research team found no associations between coffee, iced tea, decaffeinated tea or soft drink consumption and the likelihood of having glaucoma.

“Tea drinkers should keep drinking and don’t need to stop because of a fear of glaucoma,” Coleman said. “This makes sense, but we’ll see if it holds up in future studies.”

Future studies should look at the habits, activities and nutrition that affect lifestyle and glaucoma risks, said Idan Hecht of Tel-Aviv University in Israel, who wasn’t involved in the research.

“In the past few years, there has been a tremendous increase in interest, and subsequently research, into the ways lifestyle changes can influence diseases,” Hecht told Reuters Health by email.

Recent research indicates that vitamins C, E and zinc can help vision. Other studies indicate that antioxidants in tea could have similar effects, he noted.

“Patients can and should be involved and take an active role in the management of their ailments,” Hecht said. “Exercising, eating healthy and trying novel ways to improve your health is something you should definitely explore and bring up with your physician.”

Environmental factors could play a role in glaucoma risk as well, said Dr. Ahmad Aref at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

“As our population grows older, we need to think about the other factors that could help, particularly when it comes to the health benefits of physical activity,” he told Reuters Health by phone.

Overall, both medical and non-medical approaches are key to treating the disease in the future, Aref added.

“It’s a tough disease because we don’t have a way to bring vision back once it’s lost,” he said. “All we can do is prevent it from getting worse, and we want to help patients do that.”

The organization updated its guidelines for those with mild cognitive impairment Wednesday, and published them online in Neurology. The condition – which people develop as they age – involves issues with thinking and memory. It affects more than 6 percent of people in their 60s, and it increases to 37 percent for those age 85 and older.

Among the guidelines:

Doctors should tell people with mild cognitive impairment to exercise consistently, as six-month studies have indicated exercising twice a week could improve memory.

Medical professionals can suggest cognitive training for people, though the evidence isn't strong that this could be beneficial for improvement.

Mild cognitive impairment should not be confused with dementia – mild cognitive impairment comes with milder symptoms – though evidence has shown it can escalate to that point. Those with dementia may have trouble with daily tasks like getting dressed and making meals, but with mild cognitive impairment, people tend to have more difficulty than others their age remembering things like appointments or where they keep their car keys, the Los Angeles Times reports.

story_reviews_00128,"If taking more vitamin and mineral supplements is part of your plan for a healthier new year, a new study may prompt you to reconsider.

Researchers who scoured the medical literature for evidence that calcium and vitamin D pills could help prevent bone fractures came up empty.

Their analysis focused on adults older than age 50 who lived on their own (that is, not in a nursing home or other type of residential care facility). Fractures are a serious health concern for this population — previous studies have found that about 40% of women in this age group will wind up with at least one “major osteoporotic fracture” at some point in their lives, and that among adults who break a hip, 20% died within a year of their injury.

The researchers, led by Dr. Jia-Guo Zhao of Tianjin Hospital in northeastern China, combed through clinical trials, systematic reviews and other reports published in the last decade, since late 2006. They identified 51,145 people who were included in studies assessing the role of calcium and/or vitamin D in preventing bone fractures.

Their findings appear in Tuesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.

Among the 14 trials that pitted calcium supplements against either a placebo or no treatment, there was no statistically significant relationship between use of the mineral (in pill form) and the risk of suffering a hip fracture. Nor was there any clear link between calcium supplements and fractures involving the spine or other bones.

Even when the researchers accounted for each study participant’s gender, past history of bone fractures, the amount of calcium they consumed in their diets and the dose of the calcium pills they took (if they did), there was still no sign that supplements were helpful.

An additional 17 trials examined the role of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium. Once again, they found no statistically significant link between supplement use and hip fracture risk. Ditto for fractures in the spine and elsewhere.

Upon drilling down to certain subgroups, they found that for people who started out with at least 20 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, adding more vitamin D through supplements was associated with a greater risk of hip fractures. The same was true for people who took high doses of vitamin D supplements just once a year.

Finally, there were 13 trials involving people who took a combined calcium-vitamin D supplement. As before, there was no statistically significant link between supplement use and the risk for any kind of fracture or combination of fractures. That held up even when accounting for gender, past fractures, supplement dose, dietary calcium or baseline blood levels of vitamin D.

The researchers noted that thousands of people in this final group were participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the U.S. Earlier reports based on data gathered by the Women’s Health Initiative found that calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with a lower risk of fractures, but only for women who took hormone therapy after menopause. To get a clearer picture of the direct link (if any) between supplements and fracture risk, Zhao and his colleagues opted not to include data from women on hormone therapy.

It’s still possible that calcium and vitamin D supplements are useful for people who live in nursing homes or other residential facilities, the study authors wrote. Such people are more likely to have osteoporosis, due to a combination of poor diet, less sun exposure (which the body needs to synthesize vitamin D) and other factors.

But for older adults who live on their own, they wrote, the results are clear: “These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements.”

story_reviews_00129,"It's no secret that many people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may gravitate towards cigarette smoking. Many experts indicate that there is an association between people with the disorder and the desire to light up.

Dr. Jeffrey Newcorn, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of ADHD and Learning Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says that there is indeed a relationship between ADHD and smoking. ""People with ADHD are at somewhat of an increased risk to abuse drugs,"" he says, adding that the drug they're more likely to resort to is nicotine because of its role in modulating the neurotransmission of dopamine in the brain.

People with ADHD don't produce as much dopamine – a neurotransmitter linked to the ability to regulate emotional response – as someone without the disorder. Dopamine is also associated with feelings of reward and pleasure. Research has found a connection between ADHD symptoms and lowered dopamine levels, or issues with the efficiency of the brain's dopamine receptors.

Newcorn explains that through the years there have also been some schools of thought that people with ADHD have a harder time quitting the habit. This ultimately drove researchers to think about developing a nonstimulant alternative in the form of a drug that safely mimics the effects of nicotine. However, he says that this hasn't yet panned out.

Instead, what has gained more attention, Newcorn says, is research about any possible roles ADHD stimulant medications may play in helping someone with the disorder quit, or at least reduce nicotine use. ""There has been and continues to be a lot of interest in this area,"" Newcorn says.

More About Smoking Less, Not Stopping Completely

According to Scott H. Kollins, professor and vice chair for research in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, there isn't a concrete ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question of whether ADHD stimulants can help an ADHD person quit. In fact, he says that rather than this being an issue of quitting the habit altogether, it appears that the focus is more about ADHD stimulants' role in possibly lessening the number of cigarettes smoked.

In fact, Kollins was involved in a study – published in the Journal of Attention Disorders – that touched on this very subject. The journal states that ""our findings suggest that among adult regular smokers with ADHD who are interested in quitting, LDX does not increase the probability of smoking cessation more than does placebo, but is associated with a significant overall reduction in the amount of cigarettes smoked and is effective for reducing ADHD symptoms."" LDX stands for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, an ADHD stimulant more commonly known by the brand name Vyvanse.

In this and other related research Kollins has been involved with, he says that overall, ""stimulants don't necessarily help people with ADHD quit smoking; people don't really improve any greater than with a placebo."" However, he states that ""the people taking ADHD stimulants smoked less compared to those taking a placebo.""

Kollins also points out that this study yielded results comparable other research on the topic. In fact, the LDX study notes that ""findings from this study are consistent with another published trial of osmotic-release methylphenidate in adult smokers with ADHD, which reported no effects of the stimulant drug on smoking cessation outcomes, but reductions in cigarettes smoked/day and significant drug-placebo differences in ADHD symptoms across the study (Winhusen et al., 2010)."" Concerta is an example of an osmotic-release methylphenidate.

All of this begs the question: What is it about ADHD stimulant medication that may produce this effect? Kollins explains that ""stimulants do similar things from a pharmacologic perspective as nicotine"" suggesting that taking such medication may replace the urge to light up as frequently. Treatment with stimulants may put ""the urge to smoke in check more,"" he speculates.

The Road Ahead

Such research isn't to say that taking ADHD stimulants will automatically make a person with the disorder ease up on their habit. ""You certainly couldn't say that stimulants could be used for smoking cessation in people with ADHD,"" Newcorn says. ""On the other hand, stimulants are an appropriate treatment for people with ADHD whether they smoke or not."" He explains that currently, thinking about stimulants in terms of helping people with ADHD with smoking cessation means ""talking about something off-label"" – in other words, not for intended use despite the fact that certain positive outcomes may arise by taking it.

But Newcorn adds that there may be ""reasonable strategies"" such as limiting a medication to a specific group of people and within a specific class of medication. For example, he explains that Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, and Zyban, a drug to help a person stop smoking, are the same drug, but they are marketed for different things. ""Many studies show that Wellbutrin could have a positive effect for people with ADHD,"" he says, making the point that sorting through such labeling and marketing intricacies could play a role in further exploration on the topic.",ADHD Stimulants Might Help a Smoker With the Disorder Cut Back on Cigarettes,3,U.S. News & World Report

Picture this: While reaching for the cookie jar — or cigarette or bottle of booze or other temptation — a sudden slap denies your outstretched hand. When the urge returns, out comes another slap.



Now imagine those ""slaps"" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.

In a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they've achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out — and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.

Whether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study's leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.

As a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia — usually in people who haven't responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Another study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.

Years ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don't normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they ""don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,"" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.

But when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.

Trouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.

In 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.

First, they looked for a biomarker — an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.

The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.

The results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. ""That's the clear novelty.""

Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.

Of course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research ""we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,"" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades. ""I'm motivated by the clinical need.""

story_reviews_00131,"The spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within 24 hours after the intercourse, a new study suggests.

But such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance.

“My message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent STIs — because that’s a concern. And this strategy … could potentially be used,” said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.

advertisement

Molina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.

“I don’t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,” Molina said. “But if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.”

Rates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 — 8.7 cases per 100,000 people — was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.

Molina’s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.

The researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics — the drug doxycycline — to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.

The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn’t cure gonorrhea.

There was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can’t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.

The results can’t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.

“You’re causing friendly fire injury,” he said.

The full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.

Molina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.

A commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.

Authors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia’s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.

Laxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. “I certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,” he said.

But he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.",Study: Antibiotics could dramatically reduce sexually transmitted infections,3,STAT

That finding comes from a new study by Mayo Clinic researchers of nearly 4,100 people with lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the white blood cells that normally help fight infection.

""As physicians, we recommend physical activity for all cancer survivors to improve overall quality of life, but we did not know if physical activity would have an impact on survival in lymphoma patients,"" said study author Dr. Priyanka Pophali, a hematologist at Mayo Clinic.

""Our findings show that physical activity can have a positive impact on survival in lymphoma patients,"" she said in a Mayo news release.

Through periodic questionnaires, the researchers tracked the participants' physical activity levels from before their cancer diagnoses until three years afterwards.

People whose physical activity was greater than normal before diagnosis were less likely to have died from lymphoma, or from any other cause, than were those who'd been less active, the study found.

People who'd boosted their physical activity level after being diagnosed with lymphoma also were less likely to have died in that three-year span than were those who hadn't increased their activity level.

But the study couldn't prove that more exercise actually caused death risk to drop.

On the other hand, people whose physical activity level had declined after their diagnosis had higher death rates from lymphoma and other causes than those who had not changed their level of physical activity.

""Importantly, our study shows a survival benefit in patients who increase their level of physical activity,"" Pophali said. ""Therefore, since physical activity behaviors can be modified, physicians should counsel patients and survivors on the importance of physical activity and encourage them to maintain and, if possible, increase their level of physical activity.""

The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Atlanta. Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary because it has not been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.

story_reviews_00134,"Then, last year, Konduros enrolled in a clinical trial, receiving an experimental gene therapy at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Almost immediately, he began producing the missing clotting factor. Several weeks later, after he dropped a heavy box on his shin, he watched a bruise develop and shrink within hours. “Are you kidding me?” he thought. “Life's easy if this is what happens.”

Konduros, 53, who runs a bakery and cafe in southeastern Ontario, is one of 10 men in an early-stage trial sponsored by Spark Therapeutics. (The disorder is much more common in men than women.) On Wednesday, researchers reported that a single intravenous infusion of Spark's novel gene therapy enabled patients to safely produce sufficient clotting factor to prevent dangerous bleeding episodes.

The treatment also “nearly universally eliminated” the need for preventive infusions of clotting factor a few times a week, the scientists said. And its effects lasted; after a year and a half, the longest patient follow-up, the therapy was continuing to work.

The results, published Wednesday online in the New England Journal of Medicine, represent “another example of the gene-therapy renaissance,” Matthew Porteus, a pediatrician at Stanford University, wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the data suggests that the treatment ultimately might provide an “ideal cure” for hemophilia B.

Still, he noted, the study has some limitations. The follow-up period was relatively short, from 28 to 78 weeks in the new report; longer-term studies are needed to prove safety and effectiveness over extended periods. In addition, he said, researchers need to find ways to provide the therapy to a broader group of people, including children, and to figure out how to reduce the costs involved.

The researchers presented earlier findings on the gene therapy a year ago at the American Society of Hematology's annual meeting, but the latest data covers a larger patient group and a longer time period.

The hemophilia gene therapy is one of several being tested for conditions including sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. The one-time treatments seek to fight the disease by adding correct copies of a patient's defective genes. If approved, such treatments are expected to command stratospheric prices. For example, a separate Spark gene therapy for a rare type of childhood blindness, which is on track for Food and Drug Administration clearance soon, could cost $1 million per patient for infusions in both eyes, according to some Wall Street analysts.

Still, the therapies can produce at least some offsetting savings. Porteus noted in his editorial that the hemophilia therapy resulted in savings of about $200,000 a year per patient because of the elimination of clotting-factor infusions.

Other experts also were impressed by the results. The hemophilia study “is small but very promising, and it gives me the sense that gene therapy for hemophilia B is going to be at our disposal in no time, maybe a few years from now,” said Aric Parnes, who is associate director of the Boston Hemophilia Center at the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center and wasn't involved in the study. “One of the key things is, how long will the treatment last? Does it wane over time? So far, with a full year, it doesn’t look like that is happening.”

Lindsey George, the lead investigator and a hematologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that nine of the 10 men in the trial didn't experience any bleeding episodes after the gene therapy treatment. The one patient who needed clotting factor because of bleeding used 91 percent less than before, she said.

“People were planning their lives around hemophilia, and now they are doing activities that they weren't before,” George said. “One man who came in a wheelchair is now out of a wheelchair and is coaching Little League.”

AD

People with hemophilia B inherit a gene mutation on the X chromosome that interferes with their ability to produce normal levels of blood-clotting factor IX. (Because women have two copies of the X chromosomes, the other one can compensate, so they may carry the disease but not suffer from it.) Bleeding episodes — which can result from injury or occur spontaneously — can cause extensive damage and be life threatening.

The therapy developed by Spark, a biotech company spun off from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2013, involves a bioengineered gene designed to prompt the body to produce increased levels of a different clotting factor. The gene is transported to the liver, where clotting factor is made, by a harmless virus called an adeno-associated viral vector. For the current trial, which is being funded by Spark and Pfizer, researchers used a clotting factor that is 8 to 10 times as strong as the normal version. The stronger factor is called Factor IX-Padua, because it was discovered in 2009 in an Italian family.

Patients produced clotting-factor levels that were enough to allow blood to clot but not to spur an undesirable immune-system response, the researchers said.

story_reviews_00135,"(Reuters Health) - Leaving a bedroom door or window open may help people sleep better, a study from the Netherlands suggests.

Open windows and doors helped reduce carbon dioxide levels and improve ventilation and air flow, which was related to better sleep quality for the healthy young adults in the study.

“We spend nearly a third of our life in the bedroom environment, but the air quality in our sleeping environment is often overlooked,” said study author Dr. Asit Mishra of Eindhoven University of Technology.

“Imagine this - you are in a confined space and have limited ability to adjust the situation (since you are asleep) while you are possibly surrounded by pollutants,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “This is how things are in bed, covered under duvets or a blanket.”

For one night of the study, 17 volunteers slept with an open window or internal door. On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.

For measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.

Closed environments tended to have less background noise – but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.

Open conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.

Notably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.

Overall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions. The number of awakenings and sleep efficiency improved as carbon dioxide levels decreased.

“Opening an internal door can be a reasonably good alternative if you don’t want to open windows, either for noise concerns or security concerns,” Mishra said.

A limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night.

“Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns. He is also part of LIFE Index-Air, a European research group that focuses on human exposure to pollutants.

In a recent study, Canha and colleagues found that closed doors and windows led to higher levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other substances such as formaldehyde.

“Sleep is essential to our life in several areas: health, well-being and productivity,” Canha told Reuters Health by email. “The exposure we are under while asleep is continuous . . . and we should play it safe in order to breathe better air during sleep.”

story_reviews_00136,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects 422 million people worldwide. For decades, doctors have treated it with medications designed to keep blood sugar levels down.

But in a paper published in the Lancet, researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight.

Nearly half of people in the study who were given a six-month diet plan and lost an average of 30 pounds went into remission and no longer had diabetes. None took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone.

Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body’s in ability to break down sugars from the diet. Normally, cells in the pancreas work to release insulin, a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs. Cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation. But excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin-producing cells, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery.

In the study, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University, and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly 300 people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments, including diabetes medications. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet.

The diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan.

Taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group.

“People newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn’t necessarily for life,” says Taylor. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”

Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications.

The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently — within the past six years — and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That’s because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.

But left in this state too long, the cells eventually die and cannot be revived. Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission.

That points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it’s critical to discuss from the start — when people are diagnosed with diabetes — the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations.

Taylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. “From the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,” he says. “We can offer people hope from the start.”

This article is more than 1 year old

A new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as “the start of real change” in how the condition is treated.

Erenumab, a laboratory-made antibody that blocks a neural brain pathway called CGRP, is the first drug in 20 years proven to prevent migraine attacks.

Phase three trial data on nearly 1,000 patients showed that it typically cut between three and four “migraine days” per month. In half the patients treated, migraine duration was reduced at least by half.

Migraines could be caused by gut bacteria, study suggests Read more

Migraines are characterised by an intense, throbbing headache, sensitivity to light and noise, nausea, vomiting, low energy, and visual disturbances. Attacks can last anything from four to 72 hours.

Each year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience migraine – more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.

The condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the UK economy more than £2bn per year.

The trial, called Strive, compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non-active placebo dummy drug.



The research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.



Lead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “The results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.”

Simon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: “Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives. The effects can last for hours, even days in many cases.

“An option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived.”



“Broadly speaking I think this is a very interesting study and I think it is a good step forward for the field and I think it is a good day for migraine sufferers,” said professor Zameel Cader, Director of the Oxford Headache Centre who was not involved in the research, pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine.

“Placebo responses [in migraine studies] are quite high and I think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms,” he said, adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets.



Cader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies, and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies, and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day.

“This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.

Amgen and Novartis, the codevelopers of erenumab, funded the trial, while Amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses.","Migraine drug could halve the length of attacks, study shows",2,The Guardian
story_reviews_00139,"An emerging treatment for a common hospital-acquired infection could be (slightly) less gross in the future. Researchers have found that delivering a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in a pill—a poop pill, basically—is no worse than a similar procedure done with a colonoscopy.

Neither option may sound particularly enticing, but FMTs are wildly effective at treating a very nasty infection called Clostridium difficile. One of the first controlled clinical trials for FMTs in 2013 ended early because the patients who received the treatment were doing so much better than patients who didn’t. In the new study, almost 90 percent of adults treated with the capsules were cured.

“It’s absolutely insane. We just don’t see kind of efficacy with drugs,” Dr. Dina Kao told Newsweek. Kao is one of the authors of the paper and a gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta. Kao and her colleagues published the findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.

C. difficile infections can set in after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can wipe out some of the bacterial populations normally found in people’s gut. The transplants work by replacing those “healthy” bacteria. “C. difficile is the single biggest cause of diarrhea in a health care setting,” Kao said. “It is our public enemy No. 1 in hospitals.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, C. difficile infects half a million people in the United States per year and kills 15,000 people. But patients may be hesitant to accept this potentially life-saving treatment because there are feces involved. Previous research found that while every part of this treatment was unappealing to most people, being offered the treatment in a pill form made patients significantly more open to the idea. Other efforts to take the “poop” out of the poop pills—to just include the bacteria thought to be behind the benefits—have failed.

REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay

The 116 patients used in this study may have been selected in part because they were ideal candidates for FMTs, Dr. Elizabeth Hohmann noted, but she said the paper is solid overall. (Hohmann, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who has also done research on FMTs, was not involved in his research.) “The results are sort of a best-case scenario,” she said. “What I like about this paper is that it validates the upper-GI route and demonstrates that you can get very good cure rates without doing a colonoscopy.”

That’s important because colonoscopies and the anesthesia required for the procedure can put a lot of stress on a person’s body and can be complicated for the people most at risk for C. difficile infections, Hohmann noted

Kao’s study also showed that people found FMTs far less unpleasant when the poop came in a pill. Two-thirds of the 57 patients who got the pills said their experiences were “not at all unpleasant,” while just 44 percent of the 59 patients who received the FMT via a colonoscopy could say the same.

But most importantly, the study found no difference in effectiveness between the two therapies. There was a significant difference in cost. Though the procedures were done in a Canadian hospital, the FMTs delivered by colonoscopy cost nearly $500 USD more than the capsules, which cost about $300.

FMTs are not yet common practice, though Kao noted that it is becoming the standard of care for C. difficile infections. “For this group of patients, nothing else really works,” she said. However, the same cannot be said yet for other conditions. While the FDA said in 2013 that doctors can try fecal transplants in patients with C. difficile infections, the agency noted doctors should only use FMT for other conditions in clinical trials. Over 100 clinical trials are ongoing for various FMT therapies, including ones to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in children. (New FDA guidelines have been in the works since 2016 but aren’t finalized.)

Despite the FDA’s advice, some people have set up shop as FMT providers anyway. Buzzfeed reported in June that one clinic in Tampa was even providing FMTs as a treatment for autism.

Though physicians think they know how FMTs work, it remains somewhat mysterious. One recent, small study found that even stool samples that are entirely free of bacteria can be effective, perhaps because there are non-bacterial organisms that also help.

“We still don’t understand what’s going on, and in these other conditions it’s not as clear-cut that the disturbance in the bacterial composition is the cause,” Kao said. “Stool is such a complex mixture.”",Eating a Poop Pill Works to Cure This Deadly and Common Hospital Infection,4,Newsweek
story_reviews_00140,"A Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington for a delicate operation: replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery. A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing — a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure.

Desperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation — replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery — as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all.

“Right in this area, feel that — that is your lymph node,” Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up.

Song, Georgetown’s plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank’s back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song’s only caution: “Take care of them,” by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed.

“This isn’t a cure. I will still have to be careful,” said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, “I will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it’s incredible.”

Lymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection.

Lymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that’s part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up.

There’s no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers.

Consider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a “sentinel node biopsy” — removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer — will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm.

Yet too often women aren’t warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York’s Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.

Typical patients have “had that swelling for a while,” Feldman said. “Now the treatment is an uphill battle.”

The main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank’s arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain.

“But if I used my arm, I was back to square one,” Wolfe-Tank said. “I didn’t fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I’m not supposed to shovel. We’ve got to fix this.”

Wolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body’s trunk than in the limbs — more avenues to drain off fluid — and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they’d grow new channels to drain fluid.

It’s not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead.

Some surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling — and connect them to blood vessels to drain.

“Surgical options offer great potential,” note the breast surgeons’ new guidelines. But they don’t work for everyone.

About a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said.

And Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies.

Feldman’s bottom line: Patients considering microsurgery should be evaluated in a comprehensive lymphedema program to determine their best options.

story_reviews_00141,"You don’t have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity, according to new research in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise—like running errands and cleaning the house—was linked to a lower risk of death.

Moderate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. “The paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,” says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.

For the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.

Based on the data from the women’s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.

Light physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn’t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults’ daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.

“We’ve always been told that this type of activity isn’t enough to do you good,” says LaCroix. “But what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman’s risk of dying over the next three to four years—and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.”

MORE: TIME’s Guide to Exercise

The study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.

As adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says—so they don’t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. “We know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,” she says. “It’s not one size fits all.”

But national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.

LaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines. Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don’t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. “What makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,” she says.

The researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people—especially older ones—think about exercise and their goals for being active. “I think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don’t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,” LaCroix says. “They throw up their hands and think, ‘that’s not for me.’ But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.”

story_reviews_00142,"(CNN) A saliva test may someday be able to diagnose a concussion and predict how long symptoms last, according to a study published Monday in the JAMA Pediatrics.

In their study, Penn State College of Medicine researchers found five small molecules called microRNAs in saliva with real potential for identifying concussive symptoms in children, teens and young adults. MicroRNAs influence protein activities throughout the body, and they are easily measured in biofluids, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid and saliva, according to the authors.

Dr. Steve Hicks, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State College of Medicine, said the ""five microRNAs in saliva could predict with approximately 85% accuracy which concussed children would have symptoms one month later. In comparison, standard survey measures that are typically used in clinics were approximately 65% accurate.""

The study was funded in part by Quadrant Biosciences, a biotech company that hopes to bring a saliva test for concussion to market in the next 12 to 24 months, Hicks said.

Concussions affect mostly children

In 2013, there were about 2.8 million traumatic brain injury-related ER visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

JUST WATCHED Concussions keep kids out of school Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Concussions keep kids out of school 01:08

Nearly two-thirds of concussions take place in children and teens, Hicks and his co-authors noted. Although most patients' symptoms disappear within two weeks, one-third of children and teens may experience prolonged symptoms of concussion.

""It's frustrating for both parents and physicians that we can't accurately and objectively predict how long a child's concussion symptoms might last, what those symptoms are likely to consist of and when it might be safe for them to return to sports or school,"" said Hicks, who, as a practicing pediatrician, has routinely cared for kids with concussions.

For the study, Hicks and his co-authors looked at 52 patients between the ages of 7 and 21, with an average age of 14.

MicroRNA expression was measured in saliva spit into a cup by the patients, who had been injured mostly in sports or car accidents, when they arrived at Penn State Hershey Medical Center for an evaluation. Of the 52, 30 had prolonged symptoms and 22 had short-term symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury.

Levels of five microRNAs accurately identified patients with prolonged symptoms in the study. Even more, the five saliva biomarkers were more accurate than the Standardized Concussion Assessment Tool 3, a questionnaire currently used to help make a diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury. The questionnaire is not a standalone tool but one used in conjunction with an assessment made by a medical professional. It notes that an athlete may have a concussion even if their score is ""normal.""

""We found three microRNAs that were highly associated with specific symptoms one month after injury, such as headache, fatigue and memory difficulties,"" Hicks said. He added that creating an actual test for use by doctors will require collaboration on the part of researchers.

""Fortunately, the technology required to measure saliva RNA is already employed in medicine; we use it to check patients for upper respiratory viruses in our hospitals and clinics every day,"" Hicks said. ""Modifying this approach for patients with concussions could potentially provide a rapid, objective tool for managing brain injury.""

The new research ""represents an advance in the science of sport-related concussions,"" according to an editorial published alongside the study in JAMA Pediatrics.

'Way too early to know'

However, the editorial authors, Dr. William P. Meehan III of Micheli Center for Sports Injury Prevention at Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts and Dr. Rebekah Mannix of Brain Injury Center at Boston Children's Hospital, noted that ""the relatively small sample size in this study requires larger-scale studies to determine the reliability"" of the results.

For example, they noted that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications is common among those with more severe injury. In the study, those who had used anti-inflammatory medications were the ones with longer-term symptoms. Possibly, then, the drugs may be a potential 'confounding' variable, they wrote, meaning that medication may influence test results and symptoms, adding an element of confusion to the study and its possible interpretation.

Still, ""the findings are promising, representing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis, recovery, and prognostic assessment of a sport-related concussion.""

Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher, a neurologist and National Director of The Sports Neurology Clinic at The CORE Institute, said that ""work like this is important because it does provide potential for tests that can be helpful in the clinical setting.""

""I think the main caveat is, this is way too early to know what this type of tool can do for us,"" added Kutcher, who was not involved in the new research. ""The main reason is that there's a difference between simply having a brain that experiences force and being concussed.""

The saliva biomarker may be showing that neurons experienced force and not that a there is a concussion, with which the brain cannot perform its typical functions within a normal range, he said: ""I would hesitate to assign too much potential groundbreaking science.""

Other biomarkers, including blood, are being investigated as potential concussion tests, he said, though ""nothing is at this stage or beyond this.""

There are also tools that look at the electrical networks that brains form, he said, disclosing that he is consulting for a company working on one such technology. A patient undergoes an electroencephalogram while doing a cognitive task, and the EEG records how the brain responds.

""By actually (measuring) the brain network activity directly, you can look at really what is the functional health of the brain,"" he said.

In addition, some scientists are exploring functional MRI techniques to look at the metabolic function of different areas of the brain to gain insight into concussion, he said.

Hicks said he and his colleagues are collaborating with others to examine saliva biomarkers in adult athletes and members of the armed services.

""Because the markers we identified in this study are not correlated with patient age, we are hopeful they may be applied in adult populations, as well,"" he said.","Spit test may diagnose, predict duration of concussion in kids",4,CNN
story_reviews_00143,"The American Heart Association has changed the definition of hypertension for the first time in 14 years, moving the number from the old standard of 140/90 to the newly revised 130/80.

The change is outlined in the American Heart Association 2017 Hypertension Practice Guidelines, an extensive report by experts without relevant ties to the pharmaceutical industry.

The changes are expected to drastically impact adult Americans: revising the hypertension threshold downward will increase the percent of U.S. adults living with high blood pressure from 32 percent to 46 percent -- nearly half of the adult population. It will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under 45 and doubling the number of women under 45 with the diagnosis.

American Heart Association

The new guidelines reflect years of research, which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future, such as heart attacks or strokes. As such, health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure.

While the new guidelines significantly increase the number of Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension, they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication. The number of Americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only 4.2 million adults, or 5 percent more than were previously recommended. Medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age, blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack.

The study authors recommend lifestyle changes, including exercise, diet modifications and weight loss, as the first step to reducing high blood pressure.

Doctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension. They recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home. Writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with “white-coat syndrome” -- with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctor’s office.

High blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes, and is sometimes called “the silent killer” because so many adults live with high blood pressure and don’t know it.

story_reviews_00144,"(CNN) The first large head-to-head comparison of two opioid addiction medications found that, although they were equally effective in getting people off of high levels of opioids, users had a significantly more difficult time starting a regimen of naltrexone, compared with buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine is commonly known by the the brand name Suboxone, and naltrexone is sold under the brand name Vivitrol.

The study, published Tuesday in the Lancet , looked at 570 patients with opioid addiction at eight inpatient treatment centers across the country for 24 weeks. Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.

Six percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.

That hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. ""If you're currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,"" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.

Once on either of the medications, people fared equally well. ""They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,"" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.

What was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. ""Much like you would expect if the doctor told you 'you have cancer' or 'you have diabetes,' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,"" he said.

The gold standard of addiction treatment

Public health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.

This year alone, the CDC estimates that more than 64,000 people have died of drug overdoses, most of them from opioids -- more than the number of American troops lost during the entire Vietnam War . Studies have found that using medicated-assisted treatments can reduce overdose mortality by half.

Methadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.

Naltrexone has become become an increasingly popular choice among drug courts . Some say that's because of the once-a-month administration, and others say it's because it requires that users completely detox before starting the regimen.

Understanding addiction

""People need choices,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, a professor at the University of Washington's School of Public Health. Banta-Green, who was not involved in the new study, said that getting the right treatment means understanding addiction from a psychological as well as biological perspective.

Legally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.

The body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.

""To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,"" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people's cravings. ""They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,"" he said.

On the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. ""You're not getting an opiate effect,"" Banta-Green explained.

If a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. ""It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can't use,"" he said.

So, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can't manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn't want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.

What is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.

Addiction ""is an incredibly deadly disease,"" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at ""evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.""

Banta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. ""I say this a lot to judges: You can't just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.""","Some opioid addiction drugs harder to start than others, study finds",3,CNN
story_reviews_00145,"The question

People treated in the emergency room for a sprain, strain or fracture are generally given opioids to help them cope with the pain, often leaving with a prescription for opioids, too. Might non-opioid painkillers work just as well as these addictive drugs?

This study

The study involved 416 adults (average age, 37) who had gone to an emergency department with an extremity injury causing moderate to severe pain (averaging 8.7 on a scale of 1 to 10).

For pain, they were randomly assigned to take acetaminophen along with a non-opioid — ibuprofen — or with one of three commonly prescribed opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine.

Within two hours, all participants reported essentially identical declines in pain, about four points on the scale. Even for people who initially had rated their pain as a 10 (for the worst pain possible) or had broken a bone, there was virtually no difference in pain reduction between those who had and had not taken an opioid.

Who may be affected?

Adults with arm or leg pain caused by a sprain, strain or fracture. Research has shown that even short-term opioid use, such as that stemming from an initial prescription for pain from an injury or surgery, can make people predisposed to a dependence on the powerful drugs — partly from their effectiveness at relieving pain and partly from the euphoria they produce. Abuse of opioids has become an epidemic in the United States, with opioids now causing 60 percent of drug overdose deaths.

Caveats

Data on pain came from the participants' ratings; no information on side effects was collected. The study did not assess longer-term pain reduction.

story_reviews_00148,"A procedure used to relieve chest pain in hundreds of thousands of heart patients each year is useless for many of them, researchers reported on Wednesday.

Their study focused on the insertion of stents, tiny wire cages, to open blocked arteries. The devices are lifesaving when used to open arteries in patients in the throes of a heart attack.

But they are most often used in patients who have a blocked artery and chest pain that occurs, for example, walking up a hill or going up stairs. Sometimes patients get stents when they have no pain at all, just blockages.

Heart disease is still the leading killer of Americans — 790,000 people have heart attacks each year — and stenting is a mainstay treatment in virtually every hospital. More than 500,000 heart patients worldwide have stents inserted each year to relieve chest pain, according to the researchers. Other estimates are far higher.",‘Unbelievable’: Heart Stents Fail to Ease Chest Pain,4,New York Times
story_reviews_00149,"A new study raised questions about the benefits of a relatively common procedure for heart patients—implanting tiny devices that prop open clogged arteries to relieve chest pain.

The 200-patient study conducted by U.K. researchers found that patients with stable chest pain, or angina, who received stent devices experienced no significant improvement in exercise time on a treadmill, compared with similar patients who received no stents during sham procedures.

All patients had received intensive treatment with heart drugs for six weeks before the real or fake procedures.

“Symptoms didn’t improve as much as expected” in the patients who received stents, Rasha Al-Lamee, an interventional cardiologist at Imperial College London and one of the study’s lead investigators, said in an interview. She presented results of the study at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical conference in Denver; results were simultaneously published online Thursday by The Lancet.

Dr. Al-Lamee cautioned that the findings apply to a minority of the population of patients who now receive stents, those with narrowing of only one artery and certain other characteristics. She said the study doesn’t apply to patients having heart attacks, who may benefit from stents, and to patients with chest pain who have disease in more than one artery.

The study also found that stents improved blood supply to the heart versus placebo, she said.

Still, the study could affect a portion of a multibillion business for stent manufacturers including Medtronic PLC, Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific Corp. About 500,000 stents are implanted for stable angina each year world-wide, the study’s researchers wrote in The Lancet.

Abbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton said the new study had patients with mild disease “who weren’t reflective of patients who typically undergo stenting procedures,” and that some patients received stents in the trial who wouldn’t have gotten them otherwise because of the study design.

Medtronic and Boston Scientific all referred questions about the study to a statement issued Thursday by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, whose members include cardiologists who perform stent procedures. The SCAI said it questioned the study’s conclusions, and that SCAI believes stents are the preferred treatment for cardiac patients who need more than medicines to improve health and quality of life.

But some doctors said the study’s outcome should discourage use of stents in many patients.

The results show “unequivocally” that there are no benefits for stent procedures compared with drugs for stable angina, two cardiologists wrote in an editorial accompanying the results in The Lancet.

The cardiologists, David L. Brown of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Rita F. Redberg of University of California, San Francisco, called for cardiology-treatment guidelines to downgrade the recommendation of stents for stable chest pain, and focus on treating these patients with medicine.

Past studies have proven that stents can save lives when used in acute situations like heart attacks. But other studies have challenged their uses in patients with less severe disease and symptoms, including a landmark study released in 2007. Changes to treatment guidelines since then have curbed the over-use of stent procedures, according to a 2015 study .

While the new study’s findings are being debated, it is notable for its design: It is the first to compare stents with placebo while keeping patients in the dark about whether or not they received a stent. All patients had catheters inserted in an artery and were heavily sedated before being taken into a catheter lab. But only about half were given actual stents, while the rest were left on cath-lab tables for about 15 minutes, then had the catheters removed.

Researchers chose this design to minimize the “placebo effect” seen in past studies, in which a portion of symptom improvement in patients receiving stents could be attributed to their expectation that the stent would make them feel better.

All patients in the study took drugs including aspirin, anti-platelet drugs, cholesterol-lowering statins and beta blockers for about six weeks. This was followed by baseline treadmill tests and either the stent or sham procedure. They underwent treadmill tests again six weeks after the procedures. Researchers used exercise time as the main measure because physical exertion is usually what triggers angina, and it usually goes away when patients rest, Dr. Al-Lamee said.

Patients receiving stents improved their exercise times by an average of 28 seconds, while those who didn’t improved their times by an average of nearly 12 seconds. But the difference wasn’t statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.

story_reviews_00150,"(Reuters Health) - Brain surgery for children whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure-free after one year and can do it without affecting IQ, according to a new Indian study of 116 patients in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery. Behavior and quality of life also improved.

But surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.

“What the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,” senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

Not only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.

About 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can’t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.

“This is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,” said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.

“The results are impressive,” he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It’s documentation that these techniques really work.”

Although 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.

When all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.

Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality.

Surgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn’t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and “that may be too soon to see a noticeable change” in the intelligence quotient.

Post-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.

The weakness “is significant,” Dr. Tripathi said. “The child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.”

Other side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.

In contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.

The surgery “had a transforming effect on how they get along in life,” Dr. Tripathi said. “Many could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.”

But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.

Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.

“Studies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,” he said. “I hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.”

story_reviews_00151,"The results of dozens of scientific studies into the effects of smoking on the lungs are conclusive: Cigarette smoking is the No. 1 risk factor for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is, as the name suggests, a chronic lung disease that makes it progressively harder to breathe. Although patients currently have several treatment options available to help manage the disease – whose name is an umbrella term encompassing both emphysema and chronic bronchitis – there is no cure.

Although it's clear that exposure to cigarette smoke is a major cause of COPD, it's not the only cause and scientists still aren't sure exactly how cigarette smoke and other inhaled irritants can trigger the development of COPD. One working theory is that smoking cigarettes depletes the body of vitamin A, a nutrient that the lungs use to repair themselves.

The National Institutes of Health reports that ""Vitamin A is the name of a group of fat-soluble retinoids, including retinol, retinal and retinyl esters."" It's involved in maintaining the immune system, vision, reproduction and communication between cells. ""Vitamin A also supports cell growth and differentiation, playing a critical role in the normal formation and maintenance of the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs.""

Vitamin A enters the discussion with COPD because the body uses vitamin A to build and repair lung tissue. Dr. Antonello Punturieri, program director for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/environment at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, says the connection between vitamin A and the lungs starts from the very beginning, while we're developing in utero and continues well into adulthood. ""The lungs are still developing until age 25 or 30. This is why teen smoking is so bad,"" he says. Having an adequate vitamin A intake throughout this developmental period is critical to developing and maintaining strong, healthy lungs, he says.

But if our lungs don't have enough vitamin A to build or repair themselves, that could potentially lead to lung infections or chronic diseases of the lungs. A 2003 study in the journal Molecular Aspects of Medicine explains that ""during moderate vitamin-A-deficiency, the incidence for diseases of the respiratory tract is considerably increased and repeated respiratory infections can be influenced therapeutically by a moderate vitamin-A-supplementation. In addition to the importance of the vitamin for the lung function, vitamin-A is also responsible for the development of many tissues and cells as well as for the embryonic lung development.""

Another study conducted in Nepal and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 also found that pregnant women who'd taken vitamin A supplements during pregnancy had children with better lung health when the researchers followed up 9 to 13 years later. ""Early interventions involving vitamin A supplementation in communities where undernutrition is highly prevalent may have long-lasting consequences for lung health,"" the authors concluded.

So it seems clear that vitamin A plays a role in lung health. To further investigate this connection, researchers in Holland bred laboratory mice to have reduced, but not deficient, levels of vitamin A. In their 2011 study, published in the Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology, the researchers then exposed these mice to cigarette smoke and observed that the mice developed emphysema in just three months. Although the study was done in mice and human physiology is different, there could be some implications here for the interaction of cigarette smoke, vitamin A levels and the development of chronic lung diseases.

One of these hoped-for implications is a way to reverse or cure the lung damage that results in COPD. Way back in 1997, researchers at the Georgetown University School of Medicine showed that retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, reversed emphysema in the lungs of lab rats. The treatment restored lung alveoli – the small air sacs in the lungs that move oxygen and carbon dioxide into and out of the blood – to normal size and number. These spaces tend to become overinflated in patients with emphysema, so the results of that particular study were encouraging in advancing the idea of using vitamin A as a possible treatment for emphysema and COPD. But in a press release from the NHLBI, study co-author Dr. Donald Massaro urged caution. ""A great deal more basic research is needed before we can even begin to think about applying this to humans. Until then, we caution that there is absolutely no evidence that Vitamin A supplementation is useful in treating lung disorders."" Investigations continue, but currently there's still not enough evidence to support the idea that supplementing your diet with vitamin A is going to have a big impact on COPD symptoms or the progression of the disease.

Still, it's an important micronutrient that you should seek to include in your diet. Although most Americans are not deficient in vitamin A – the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that less than 1 percent of the population is deficient in vitamin A – the Mayo Clinic currently recommends that adult men 18 years and older should seek to take in 900 micrograms (3,000 international units) of vitamin A daily. Women age 18 and older should aim for 700 micrograms (2,300 IU) daily. Pregnant and nursing woman may need more vitamin A.

Vitamin A can be found in most multivitamins and in dairy products, liver, fortified foods, fish and darkly colored fruits and vegetables. ""Five servings of fruits and vegetables daily supplies 5 to 6 milligrams of provitamin A carotenoids, which provides about 50 to 65 percent of the adult recommend dietary allowance for vitamin A,"" the Mayo Clinic reports.",Can Vitamin A Help With My COPD?,4,U.S. News & World Report

THURSDAY, Oct. 26, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Blood thinners may pull double duty for people with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation: New research suggests they help prevent dementia as well as stroke.

Because atrial fibrillation increases the risk for stroke, people with the condition are often prescribed blood thinners (also known as anticoagulants) to prevent blood clots that can cause a stroke.

Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk for dementia. During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia.

At the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban).

The researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners.

When the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.

Along with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson's disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.

The findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.

""In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,"" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. ""It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.""

However, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.

""Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,"" he said. ""In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.""

""If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,"" he said.

story_reviews_00153,"The first oral treatment for women with the common condition of uterine fibroids could be available as soon as summer 2018, with two other medications in the pipeline.

The drugs, experts say, would provide a new treatment option for a condition most commonly treated with a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus.

“For the longest time we have not really had good options from an oral medication standpoint to treat fibroids,” says Arnold Advincula, vice chairman of women’s health and chief of gynecology at Sloane Hospital for Women at NewYork-Presbysterian/Columbia University Medical Center. “It’s nice to have some additional tools in the toolbox.”

Related Coverage How Morcellation Spread Cancer in Hysterectomy Patients

Earlier in October the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted Allergan’s new drug application for ulipristal acetate (UA) to treat abnormal uterine bleeding caused by uterine fibroids. The company expects a decision by May.

The drug has been available in Europe and Canada for several years.

Two other oral medications indicated to treat uterine fibroids are also in development. Bayer launched a phase 3 clinical trial—usually the final trial used by regulators to decide whether to approve a drug—for a similar drug, vilaprisan, in the summer. And AbbeVie is in the midst of phase 3 trials for elagolix to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis, a disorder in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of it, causing pelvic pain. The company hopes to have a product available by 2020.

Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow in and around the uterus. It’s estimated that as many as 26 million women in the U.S. have one or more such tumors, though less than half experience symptoms. The most common symptom is long and excessive bleeding during menstrual periods, which can lead to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. Other symptoms can include pelvic pain or pressure, a swollen abdomen and frequent urination. Fibroids can also cause fertility and pregnancy problems, depending on their size and location.

The cause of fibroids remains unknown, though those with a family history have an increased risk of developing them. Dietary factors may also play a role. African-American women have a higher rate of uterine fibroids. If a woman has no symptoms, treatment of fibroids isn’t necessary, experts say.

While a hysterectomy is the most common way to treat fibroid tumors, women who still want to have children can have a myomectomy. That surgery removes fibroids while keeping the uterus intact. But fibroids can grow back after the procedure. A number of other minimally invasive procedures are less commonly used and usually not recommended for women who want to have children. There’s some chance of recurrence with most of them.

UA belongs to a group of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM). They block the progesterone from feeding the fibroids, which causes them to shrink.

“This particular drug also works directly on the lining of the uterus—the endometrium—so it also quite fast and dramatically decreases and stops the vaginal bleeding,” says Ayman Al-Hendy, director of interdisciplinary translational research at Augusta University in Georgia and a member of Allergan’s advisory board. Bleeding is reduced within five to six days, he says. Headaches and hot flashes were the most common side effects in the trials with UA, affecting less than 10% of women.

Patients take the once-a-day pill for three months and then stop for one menstrual cycle to allow the endometrium to shed, since the medication makes it grow thicker. Dr. Al-Hendy says the changes to the endometrium don’t raise the risk of endometrial cancer, which some have raised as a concern.

Patients with the condition say it’s time for better treatments.

Tanika Gray Valbrun, a 39-year-old network news producer in Atlanta, says she welcomes less invasive treatments that don’t affect fertility. She started the White Dress Project, a nonprofit patient advocacy group for women with uterine fibroids, in 2014.

She was diagnosed with fibroids at 19. She has suffered from pelvic pain, abdominal bloating that has resulted in people mistakenly thinking she’s pregnant and extremely heavy bleeding that has left her anemic.

“I’ve had five blood transfusions because of the amount of blood I’ve lost,” she says.

She has tried different types of birth control, but none helped with her symptoms. In 2013 she had a myomectomy and doctors removed 27 fibroids, keeping her out of work for nine weeks. Four years later, the fibroids are back.

Vanessa Jacoby, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at University of California, San Francisco, conducts research in new fibroid treatments.

She says UA appears to have fewer side effects than Lupron, the only medication, an injectable, available in the U.S. that shrinks fibroids. Lupron effectively puts women into early menopause, which can result in hot flashes and bone loss. Women often must take it with hormone replacement therapy. It is usually used in preparation for surgery to shrink fibroids and maintain blood reserves.

While the company has done studies of women taking the drug up to a year, some experts believe the long-term health profile of a drug needs to be evaluated up to seven years, Dr. Jacoby says.

Shao-Lee Lin, vice president of therapeutic areas and international development at AbbVie, says the company is testing a twice daily dosing of elagolix. It is also studying including low-dose hormone therapy within elagolix to help maintain bone health.

Like Lupron, elagolix decreases sex hormones that cause fibroids to grow. What makes it different is it’s fast-acting and easier to reverse the effects if you stop taking it.

Studies have found it significantly reduces heavy menstrual bleeding and decreases the thickness of the endometrium by six months. It also decreases the size of fibroids.

story_reviews_00155,"The one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.

AD

In late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.

AD

Biotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.

The FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.

AD

“Today, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates “the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.”

AD

A CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells — sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system — are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.

In 2015, Marie Miceli was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Siteman Cancer Center in St. Louis, which is jointly owned by Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine. She received chemo and underwent a bone-marrow transplant. Neither worked.

AD

“The doctors were saying, 'Go see an attorney and get your life in order,' "" the 64-year-old Realtor recalled. Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. “I could feel it when they put those T cells back in,” she said. “It was the craziest feeling in the world.” When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.

AD

Kite's “vein-to-vein” turnaround period — from cell extraction to reinfusion — is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.

The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.

AD

“This is not just an incremental benefit,” said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. “It raises the potential that a cure can be possible.” Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.

AD

Locke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.

“These are patients who knew they were out of options,” he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.

AD

Because of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.

AD

Kite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.

Armin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is “just the first step” and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.

“There's nothing worse than telling patients, 'I'm sorry, we are done here, we don't have anything else to offer,' "" he said.

story_reviews_00156,"Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin’s muscles have been slowly collecting damage since the day they were born. Someday, they will not be able to walk. They will not be able to stand. Eventually, they will not be able to live. The brothers, ages 6 through 11, suffer from a debilitating and deadly genetic condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

Yet on September 28, Max, Rowan and Charlie Vertin got dressed up. In dark suits and blue shirts, with serious expressions on their round faces, they walked to stand next to their mother in a very beige room outside Washington, D.C. The people in that room, they believed, could change the course of their lives.

For years, the Vertin brothers have been participating in a clinical trial for a new medication called ataluren, intended to keep the progression of their disease at bay. By October 24, they’ll know if they will be able to keep taking that drug. That is the deadline for the Food and Drug Administration to make a choice. The agency could approve the drug, allowing the brothers and others like them to continue to take it. Or it could reject the drug for the third time and throw them into an uncertain future.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now

An FDA committee has already voted that data about the drug’s effectiveness was inconclusive. The agency’s final decision almost always echos the decisions of its committees. So, if this were any other kind of drug at any other time in FDA history, the FDA’s final answer would be a very predictable no.

If they do say no, the Vertins could lose access to the drug that has stabilized their condition. But there’s still a chance the FDA could approve the drug. Input from people affected by DMD may have convinced the agency once before to approve a drug for the condition despite iffy data. That is what the Vertins—and the company that produces the drug—are hoping will happen again.

Falling Behind

“It started out so innocent,” his mother, Betty Vertin, told Newsweek. Max was a big infant, born 10 lbs, 3 oz and nearly two feet long. “When he was missing milestones, I just thought it was because it was a big baby.” Even doctors assumed that he would eventually catch up. But when he started preschool, the difference between Max and other children became more obvious. “When other kids were running and jumping and climbing, Max wasn’t doing those things. He was just behind, physically.”

When Max was 4, in 2010, a genetic test confirmed that he had DMD. Betty had never heard of it. “Before we started living this life, I was clueless,” she said.

DMD is one of a class of similar genetic disorders. About 15 boys out of every 100,000 in the United States under 24 years old have DMD or a milder form, called Becker muscular dystrophy. (Most of the children affected are boys.) The illness affects the way their legs, heart, and lungs work.

Max’s diagnosis was devastating for Betty. “I feel like I walked into the room with a healthy four-year-old boy and I walked out with a child that was dying,” she said.

But the family’s struggles with DMD were just beginning. At the time, Rowan was 2, and Betty suspected that he also had the disease; she’d seen how her son struggled to stand up onto a stepstool in the bathroom to brush his teeth. She was also ten weeks pregnant with Charlie.

Genetic tests eventually confirmed both Rowan and Charlie also had DMD. Betty’s two daughters, Lexi, 16, and Mary, 2, as well as a fourth son, Chance, 10, do not.

“I felt like we had a year and a half of the same horrible diagnosis over and over and over again,” she said. “It was the hardest 18 months I’ve ever had and I hope I ever had.”

Still Walking

DMD always results in muscle weakness due to a lack of a protein called dystrophin. Some of the newest treatments for the condition try to fix that. One drug, which the FDA approved in 2016, works for people whose illness springs from a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin.

The drug, called Exondys 51 or eteplirsen, allows the genetic machinery that produces the protein to skip over the mutated part to make something that will work better. About 13 percent of people with DMD have this particular mutation, according to the FDA.

The Vertin brothers are not among them; the drug shouldn’t help them at all. So they tried ataluren. (The drug’s brand name is Translarna.) The company that produces ataluren, PTC Therapeutics, says that its drug forces cells to make the proteins in spite of a different kind of mutation called a nonsense mutation. Instead of having an error in the protein, the protein is accidentally cut short. This is the kind of mutation that three of Betty Vertin’s children have.

The Vertins have received the drug free through the clinical trial, and expenses for their trip from Nebraska to Washington, D.C. were paid by PTC Therapeutics.

Ataluren works by ordering a cell to use a slightly different piece to build the protein—as if someone spray-painted the word “don’t” on the molecular version of a stop sign. Exactly how it does that is still mysterious. A paper published by the company’s scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science said it probably affected the ribosome, a key part of how proteins are put together in a cell. (Researchers not affiliated with the company did not find the same kind of activity.)

Regardless of what mutation causes the illness, most people with DMD die in their 20s. Betty was told to expect her oldest son, Max, to be in a wheelchair full-time by the time he was 9 or 12.

Max is 11 now. His 12th birthday is in early November. He uses an electric mobility scooter for long distances, but he can still walk. He rides a bike without training wheels and without any modifications. He has a part in a school play and goes up and down stairs to get to the stage. He even plays a trumpet in his school’s band. “He’s got the lung capacity to blow that thing, very loudly,” Betty said.

For that, Betty credits ataluren, which Max started three years ago.

“His life is—it’s not like his peers, but he’s getting a lot of the experiences that his peers are having,” she said. “He’s living a sort of a typical sixth-grade life and that diagnosis—I didn’t know what it would look like for him. I didn’t expect it to look like this.”

Courtesy of Betty Vertin

But not everyone considers ataluren to be a miracle drug—with good reason. The clinical trial results haven't been great. Most of the company’s studies tested how fast a child could go about 30 feet or walk up and down stairs, or how far they could walk in six minutes. They did see some slight positive results, many of which came from a study done with the specific kind of patient the company discovered benefited most in a previous trial.

The FDA needs good data to make their decision, because when the agency approves a drug is sends a signal to the world. An approval is the FDA saying, “this drug is safe and effective. You could use it for your child, too.”

PTC Therapeutics has tried to get FDA approval for the drug twice before. Both times the agency refused to even consider the application. This time, the application for approval was filed over the FDA’s protest. (The drug has been conditionally approved in Europe.)

A Million Dollar Issue

Part of the reason that the drug has struggled is because of this requirement: if the drug is effective, the data should show it. But that hasn't happened consistently with ataluren. Many of the clinical trials failed to satisfy the statistical requirement to prove a drug works—at least not for the main outcome the company was looking at. Other, secondary measurements did seem to have good statistics. Certain groups of children seemed to have better results than others, too.

PTC Therapeutics founder and CEO Stuart Peltz says the statistics aren't a reason to reject the drug. Just because a drug doesn’t measure up in that way, he says, “doesn’t mean the drug is not effective.”

But even if the FDA agrees to overlook some of the negative data about ataluren, insurers may not. That could be a million-dollar issue for the families with affected children.

“If the evidence isn’t good, then insurance companies won’t pay for [drugs],” said National Center for Health Research (NCHR) president Diana Zuckerman. Two recently approved drugs have run into this problem: Spinraza, a drug for spinal muscular atrophy, and Exondys 51. Both drugs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Pharmaceutical companies traditionally will not discuss prices before drugs are approved; that said, ataluren costs about £220,000 in Britain. During clinical trials, participants like the Vertins normally do not pay for the treatment.

The NCHR also presented at the FDA meeting in September to discuss ataluren, urging the agency to not approve the drug without more research. The organization’s statement also raised concerns about side effects associated with the drug, specifically about the chance that it raises blood pressure and cholesterol levels in children. The company says these shifts are small and ""not clinically significant.""

In an e-mailed statement, FDA spokesperson Sandy Walsh confirmed that the FDA’s decisions are all “based on an assessment of the available data and whether the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.” That data can include the experience of patients like Max, Rowan and Charlie.

Courtesy of Betty Vertin via Facebook

To Betty, the benefits are clear, even if they aren’t easily quantified. Rowan’s gait seems better. Max still doesn’t need to use a wheelchair all the time, bucking the prediction she heard when he was first diagnosed.

However, financial analysts who track the biotech sector are not optimistic about ataluren’s immediate prospects. Matthew Eckler, a senior biotechnology analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that analysts and investors are betting the FDA will not approve the drug.

The FDA hasn’t said no yet. The agency still has nearly two more weeks to make a decision. Until then, Betty and her sons are living with a lot of uncertainty. “I’m really scared that my boys will have to go off [ataluren],” she said. Will they have access to the drug if it’s rejected? Would their conditions deteriorate if they didn’t? What other options do they have?

Betty has no good answers. She is hoping she won’t need to come up with them.

“DMD is a progressive disease, and my boys are stable,” Vertin said. “If we can just have a few more years with our boys or buy some time until there is a cure out there, that’s huge.”

story_reviews_00157,"The first placebo-controlled study of two vaccines against the Ebola virus found they both successfully created a powerful antibody response for a year, suggesting they both could be tools to save lives in a future epidemic of the deadly disease.

The research, by doctors from the U.S. and Liberian governments and elsewhere, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study looked at 1,500 patients in Liberia, and took place amid and after the outbreak of Ebola in Liberia from 2014 into 2015.

Five hundred participants received a vaccine developed by Merck & Co., 500 got one from GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which was based on work by the National Institutes of Health, and 500 received a placebo.

With the Merck vaccine, at one month, 83.7% of patients had developed antibodies to Ebola virus, versus 70.8% with the Glaxo vaccine and a negligible number, 2.8%, in the placebo group. The relationship of antibody responses was similar after 12 months, with 79.5%, 63.5% and 6.8% of patients, respectively, showing antibody response.

There is a “reasonable chance that either of these vaccines would play a role in preventing infection,” said H. Clifford Lane, deputy director for clinical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a principal investigator in this study. NIAID is part of the National Institutes of Health. The Liberian Ministry of Health and other researchers also conducted the study.

The West African Ebola outbreak—the worst in recorded history—caused an estimated 11,000 deaths amid 25,582 cases in the three nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The hemorrhagic fever, which can be fatal in half or more cases, spread from West Africa to a handful of cases in Europe and the U.S., including among health care workers. The disease appears and disappears unpredictably in the African forests, and is widely believed to be spread by bats.

In Dr. Lane’s view, given previously existing positive evidence from a Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, if doctors in a future epidemic had to choose, it would probably be the one from Merck.

That Merck vaccine was shown to be “highly efficacious” during the Ebola epidemic in Guinea by World Health Organization doctors writing in The Lancet in December. But the methodology of that study—including the lack of a placebo group—raised questions among some scientists about how conclusive those findings were.

A detailed report by the prestigious National Academy of Medicine in April questioned the methodology of the Merck vaccine study in Guinea. It concluded the Merck vaccine “most likely provides some protection” to recipients but that the protection “could in reality be quite low.”

One of the authors of that Academy of Medicine report, vaccine specialist and pediatrics professor Kathryn M. Edwards of Vanderbilt University, said the new evidence shows “the safety of the two vaccines is comparable.” But she said any comparison of the two vaccines based on the antibody evidence “is a bit undecided” because it is unknown precisely what antibody levels are needed to protect patients.

Merck said the “safety and immunogenicity results observed” in this most recent research “are consistent with what we observed in other studies.” GSK said it is too early to know whether the immunity differences between the two vaccines “indicate a clinically meaningful difference.” The NIH/GSK vaccine was the focus of a page-one Wall Street Journal article about it and the NIH scientist, Nancy J. Sullivan, who developed it.

The two different studies arose through a kind of scientific war. Several British and other European medical groups, including some who funded the Guinea study of the Merck vaccine, had argued that giving any patients a placebo wasn’t ethical in the middle of a raging epidemic. But U.S. government doctors, including leaders of the NIH, said a placebo group was necessary to ensure patients truly got benefit, and weren’t harmed, from either a vaccine or a drug.

This current study, in Liberia, was designed to avoid those pitfalls through its classic placebo-controlled design. But it ran into another obstacle: Ebola cases in Liberia began to dwindle early in 2015, and the outbreak there was declared over on May 9 of that year. By the time this work was fully under way, it was too late to see if vaccines actually prevented Ebola sickness and death.

It still was possible, however, to measure patients’ immune-systems’ response, measured by how many produced significant antibodies to the Ebola virus. Also, vaccine safety could be assessed, and both vaccines appeared safe.

NIH scientists now are evaluating antibody levels out to two years.

The level of serious adverse events was higher in the placebo group than either vaccine group, and “most of the serious adverse events were attributed to malaria,” the researchers wrote.

THURSDAY, Oct. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States, and routine screenings remain the most reliable way to detect the disease early, a breast cancer expert says.

""Breast cancer can be treated more successfully if detected in its early phases, while it is small and has not yet spread,"" said Dr. Kathryn Evers, director of mammography at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ""With today's state-of-the-art treatment options and less extensive surgery, patients are experiencing better outcomes.""

Older age is a leading risk factor for breast cancer. Most women are diagnosed after the age of 50. Having certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also predispose women to the disease. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said.

""Having one risk factor or even several doesn't mean a woman will definitely develop breast cancer,"" she said in a Fox Chase news release. ""Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.""

Not all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include:

A lump in the breast or armpit.

Swelling or thickening in part of the breast.

Dimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast.

Pain in the breast that doesn't go away.

Redness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple.

Unusual nipple discharge.

A change in the size or shape of the breast.

In some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted.

""All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them. This is an important part of breast health,"" she said. ""But just being familiar with your breasts should never take the place of regular screenings and mammograms. These tests can help find breast cancer in its early stages, even before symptoms appear.""

There are three tests often used to look for breast cancer, Evers said.

Mammogram: An X-ray of the breast used to examine breast changes. Its effectiveness depends on the size of a breast tumor and the density of breast tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) mammography involves X-ray machines that take pictures of thin slices of the breast from different angles, to build a 3D image.

""I advise women to speak with their physician to determine what is right for them,"" Evers said.

MONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.

Young women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.

The water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.

What's more, the amount of time that passed before a woman's next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.

Women are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.

Study author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.

""Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,"" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.

Dr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake ""substantial,"" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.

""It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,"" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

Dr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study ""may be a game changer"" for antibiotic ""stewardship"" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.

She cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.

""We might not even need to use antibiotics,"" she said.

The study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.

Half of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.

The remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.

The women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.

Overall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.

By contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.

Hooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.

""There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,"" he said.

Likewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.

Whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.

""In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,"" he said.

Researchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.

Research presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.

The key to making the therapy work? One of medicine’s greatest villains: HIV.

story_reviews_00162,"Regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression, according to a new Australian study, and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a real difference.

The paper, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, followed more than 22,000 healthy Norwegian adults without symptoms of anxiety or depression for an average of 11 years, asking them about their exercise habits and symptoms of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study.

At the start, about 12% said they didn’t exercise, and the rest said they exercised anywhere from “up to 30 minutes” to “more than 4 hours” a week.

Over the next decade, about 7% of people in the study developed depression, and about 9% developed anxiety. No relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety, but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression.

People who said they didn’t exercise at the study’s start were 44% more likely to become depressed, compared to those who exercised at least 1 to 2 hours a week. For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.

The study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one—especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.

If their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.

That exercise doesn’t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat.

“Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.”

Of course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health.

But when it comes to mental health benefits, “the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,” said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email.

MORE: A New Hope For Depression

The authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins.

“There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”

story_reviews_00165,"(CNN) The headlines about football players and chronic traumatic encephalopathy - commonly known as CTE - seem endless. The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.

""This is something new,"" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center.

An early step in the right direction

McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. ""The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,"" she said.

CTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain.

In this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. ""Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,"" said McKee.

More exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11

The paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported.

Although there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE.

""The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,"" said McKee.

""It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,"" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002.

While Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. ""This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,"" he said.

While it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. ""This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,"" said McKee.

story_reviews_00166,"This Test Can Determine Whether You've Outgrown A Food Allergy

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michelle Kondrich for NPR Michelle Kondrich for NPR

An estimated 4 percent of Americans have food allergies, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that allergies are a growing public health concern. But diagnosing allergies can be tricky, and kids can outgrow them, too.

Now, a new study sheds light on the effectiveness of a test called a food challenge to determine whether a person can tolerate a food they once reacted to.

Jula Cieciuch, a fifth-grader who lives in Telluride, Colo., recently took a food challenge to find out if she was still allergic to eggs.

When she passed, she was ecstatic. After years of avoiding all foods with eggs, she was a bit shocked. ""For so long, it was: You can't eat this. You can't eat this,"" Jula says. "" I was very emotional!""

She's also outgrown allergies to walnuts and almonds. ""It's a huge relief ... it has really opened up her diet — a lot,"" her mom, Kendall Cieciuch, told us. Once you can eat eggs, you can eat cakes and breads and frittatas, and lots of other baked goods.

Jula is still allergic to some foods, including milk and cashews, so she still needs to be careful. But Kendall says every time she's crossed a food off her allergy list, ""it makes life a little easier.""

Jula Cieciuch's story is not uncommon. About 70 to 80 percent of children with an egg allergy will outgrow it. And about 20 percent of kids outgrow peanut allergies.

In Jula's case, her allergists at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colo., repeated the standard allergy blood tests last summer. That's when they realized she may have outgrown her egg allergy.



The blood test measures the levels of a certain type of antibody, immunoglobulin E (IgE). The higher the level, the more likely a person is to have an allergic reaction. Jula's blood revealed a drop in antibody count.



But the only way to confirm that it was safe for Jula to eat egg was to take the food challenge test. Basically, the test entails eating small quantities of the foods you've been allergic to. The testing is done under medical supervision.

""What they do is give you a really small dose, like a crumb, basically,"" explains Jula. Then after 20 minutes or so, if you don't have any reaction, ""you can take a dose that's a little bigger."" If you can eat an entire egg, you pass.

A new study published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology illuminates just how many people come to find out they can eat foods they've long avoided.



Researchers studied the results of about 6,300 food challenges. The tests were done in adults and children whom doctors suspected had become tolerant to foods they'd once reacted to.



""We found that 14 percent of the patients challenged had mild or moderate allergic reactions,"" explains study author Carla Davis, an allergist and director of the Food Allergy Program at Texas Children's Hospital. ""If the symptoms were treated with just Benadryl or another antihistamine, they were considered mild or moderate. She says 2 percent of the reactions were more serious, requiring treatment with epinephrine.

But the vast majority of patients, 86 percent, did not have an allergic reaction. In other words, they tolerated the food just fine. She says the results aren't that surprising, since allergists had classified these patients as low-risk for reacting to the foods they were being tested for.



""I think [the results] are very encouraging,"" Bruce Lanser, a pediatric allergist who directs the Pediatric Food Allergy Program at National Jewish Health in Denver, told us. He was not involved in the study, but he says the findings mirror what he sees in his clinical practice. ""We know a certain percentage will outgrow [their] allergies,"" Lanser says. ""And the last thing I want to miss is the opportunity to get a food into a kid's diet.""

He says many of the patients in the study may have outgrown their allergy, just like Jula did. ""But it's also possible [some of them] never truly had a food allergy."" As we've reported, people sometimes misinterpret the symptoms of a condition such as lactose intolerance for a food allergy.

Lanser says it can be tricky to diagnose food allergies. That's because the two main tests doctors use — the blood test and the skin prick test — only reveal part of the story. ""Both tests only measure sensitization,"" he explains. ""All they can tell us is how likely you are to react when you eat the food.""



And that's where the oral food challenge comes in. It's become the gold standard test to rule out an allergy.

story_reviews_00168,"Update| Anyone who’s ever dieted knows that sorting through the deluge of research can be overwhelming. Paleo has a devout following who swear by its protein-heavy meals, while intermittent fasters believe that forgoing food for hours on end (which varies, but can include skipping meals for an entire day), provides the best results. For those who just can’t give up grains (or regular eating), a new study indicates that being less restrictive is actually better for your waistline.

Researchers from The University of Tasmania in Australia found that breaking up with your diet for two weeks could lead to more weight loss—and help you keep it off, too.

For the small study just published in the International Journal of Obesity, the team enlisted 51 obese men from the ages of 25 to 54 years old. All participants had maintained their current weight for six months leading up to the study and did not exercise regularly. One group of men followed the diet, which reduced calorie consumption by about one-third of their individual needs, for 16 weeks straight. The experimental group stuck to the eating plan for two weeks, before ditching the diet for two weeks. They repeated the cycle until they had also dieted for 16 weeks; however, in their case, each bout of restriction was followed by a period of eating enough calories for weight maintenance.

At the end of the study, the men following the intermittent diet plan lost 47 percent more weight than the control group. And while it’s common to regain a few pounds after returning to previous eating habits, the two-week dieters kept the pounds off, maintaining a nearly 18-pound loss six months after the study.

Krista Varady, an outside researcher who studies intermittent fasting (not the same as intermittent dieting) and weight loss at the University of Illinois, believes the results were significant.

""I was really impressed that they still saw almost a two kilogram weight loss during that last period at the end of the four months,"" she tells Newsweek. ""At that point we see almost zero weight loss,"" she explains of her own research. ""Somehow they’re kind of keeping the body on its toes.""

This trick may help combat the dreaded weight loss plateau that plagues dieters looking to lose those last five pounds. As we cut calories and lose weight, our resting metabolic rate eventually slows and our bodies become less efficient at shedding mass in a process known as adaptive thermogenesis. While frustrating, it’s one of our natural survival mechanisms to prevent potential starvation.

Another benefit from intermittent dieting? People who have a difficult time staying motivated may find relief by the two-week breaks. However, it’s important not to think of them as cheat days. The dieters ate enough calories to maintain their weight during the off period. But, Varady believes it’s probably safe to enjoy a slice of cake or bowl of ice cream during the break.

""It seemed like they probably had a couple of cheat days here and there,"" she says of the data. ""Diets tend to work if you have a couple of cheat days during the month. Just as long as it doesn’t psychologically derail people.""

story_reviews_00169,"The big question: Will cancer immune therapy work for me?

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Dennis Lyon was a genetic train wreck. Cancer was ravaging his liver, lungs, bones and brain, and tests showed so many tumor mutations that drugs targeting one or two wouldn't do much good. It seemed like very bad news, yet his doctors were encouraged.

The reason: People with the most messed-up genes often are the ones who do best on treatments that enlist the immune system.

""These are the patients we used to be very depressed about,"" thinking they couldn't be helped, said Dr. Razelle Kurzrock at the University of California, San Diego. ""Now when we see those types of patients, we're really excited,"" because there are so many ways for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as abnormal.

Immunotherapy is the hottest thing in cancer care. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can vanquish some advanced cancers by removing a chemical cloak that hides them from the immune system. Former President Jimmy Carter got one at age 91 for skin cancer that spread to his brain, and now is in remission.

But they're expensive, have side effects, and work for only about one-quarter of patients — as few as 5 percent with colon cancer and as many as half with the skin cancer, melanoma. Sometimes the benefits are brief.

Worst of all: For a small number of unlucky folks, treatment can backfire. Their cancer grows exponentially after getting a checkpoint drug.

""We're going to have to figure out not only who to treat with immunotherapy but who not to treat,"" Kurzrock said.

Gene tests are starting to help sort that out. But for patients, the big question is ""Will it work for me?""

PREDICTING WHO BENEFITS

The first step is testing for a protein called PD-L1 that's often involved in forming that chemical cloak. Some checkpoint drugs target this or a related protein, so people with a lot of it should respond to treatment.

That was the hope when Diane Tippett showed up last October at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center with a salivary gland cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs.

""Five years ago, I probably would have thrown up my hands and given her standard chemo,"" said the center's director, Dr. Louis Weiner.

Instead, he ordered tests that showed Tippett had a PD-L1 mutation, meaning her cancer made a lot of it. He started the 49-year-old Leonardtown, Maryland, woman on a checkpoint drug, Opdivo, and told her to come back in a few months.

""Quite honestly, I didn't know if I'd ever see her again,"" he said.

Now, Tippett's lung tumors are gone. Her liver tumor shrank 50 percent and is stable. She got married in July and says she feels great.

""I don't feel any different than you do. I'm not tired, I've got all my hair,"" she said. ""I want more people to know about it and to ask their doctors about it,"" she said of immunotherapy and the testing that led her to it.

NOT THE WHOLE STORY

That protein isn't a very reliable predictor, though. Some people with a lot of it don't benefit from the drugs and the opposite also is true. There are other checkpoints besides that one, too.

Researchers increasingly are focusing on something else Tippett had: a high number of flawed genes. It's a sign that tumors have been evolving over time and are hard to treat with drugs that target a single gene. It sometimes accompanies two other DNA problems that some checkpoint drugs already are approved to treat.

Lyon, the San Diego man, had nearly two dozen different mutations after his skin cancer spread widely. In October 2015, he started on Opdivo and was in near-complete remission within two months. Recent tests showed no active cancer in his spine and lungs, and doctors think small spots in his brain and liver may be scar tissue, though they can't know for sure. A test for tumor DNA in his blood found none.

""It would appear my cancer is all dead,"" he said, and called it ""nothing short of miraculous"" that gene tests led to successful treatment after years of trial and error. ""I'm so grateful. No one's lucky that gets cancer but I may be in an era where there's a way through this tunnel.""

Three-quarters of patients who are helped by checkpoint drugs have long-lasting benefits, as Lyon did, said Dr. Steven O'Day, an immunotherapy expert at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.

""When you respond, it's a home run in terms of long-term survival,"" O'Day said. ""But we still have to be better at predicting who those patients are.""

THE DARK SIDE

Others have not been so fortunate. In November, French researchers reported that 12 of 131 patients, or 9 percent, got much worse after checkpoint drugs, which seemed to speed their tumor growth.

Kurzrock checked with colleagues and quickly found more cases — a 73-year-old man with bladder cancer, a 65-year-old woman with endometrial cancer, and a 44-year-old breast cancer patient whose tumors ""just exploded"" in size within two months of immunotherapy.

In a report on 155 patients, she tied several gene mutations to this risk. Kurzrock has consulted for some gene-medicine makers and co-founded a company using a software program to determine best treatments for patients depending on their tumor genes.

The unfortunate cases are a reality check, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.

""We are not paying close enough attention to those people"" and need to know whether they fared badly because of their treatment or for other reasons, he said.

SHOULD WE BE DOING 'IMMUNOGRAMS'?

That's the question Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, posed a gene medicine conference he organized in March at the suburban San Diego research center. Should there be baseline tests to map what patients' natural defenses look like? For example, how many immune system soldiers called T cells do they have in the area of the tumor?

Max Krummel is working on a roadmap to do that. The University of California, San Francisco, scientist heads a project with $10 million from three companies that make checkpoint drugs. He is analyzing hundreds of tumor samples to see what immune system features spell success or failure.

""We're not looking at how the immune system changes,"" but for what starting point works best with the drugs, he said. ""What we're seeing is that the kinds of cells you have in a tumor predict who's going to respond.""

Krummel, who was involved in work that led to Yervoy, the first checkpoint drug, has started a company to try to tune up one part of the immune system he thinks is key to maintaining a healthy balance.

Cancer exists because the immune system isn't working as it should, he said, so successful immunotherapy may require ""treating the immune system, not treating the tumor.""

story_reviews_00170,"A new genetic testing kit that hits the market today is the most affordable, and arguably one of the simplest, ways for women to find out if they have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

Here is what women should know about BRCA gene mutation testing, including how it works, who should actually consider getting it and the new convenient test that one woman already credits for helping detect her cancer early.

What are the BRCA genes?

The two BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) normally help protect women from cancer, however, some women may have mutations to their BRCA genes, which can actually lead to cancer, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If untreated, women with a BRCA gene mutation are seven times more likely to get breast cancer, and 30 times more likely to get ovarian cancer before the age of 70, when compared with women without the gene mutations, according to the CDC.

Should everyone take a BRCA gene test?

Medical professionals say no.

The BRCA test is ""absolutely not recommended for every single person,"" according to Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News chief women's health correspondent.

She identified the criteria doctors want people to meet before being tested for BRCA, including:

1) A family history of someone having a positive BRCA mutation.

2) Ovarian cancer at any age in the family.

3) Breast cancer before the age of 50.

4) Triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 60.

5) Male breast cancer in the family at any age.

6) People of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

7) People who have had two or more cases of breast cancer, one occurring before the age of 50, on their mother’s or father’s side of the family.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine BRCA gene testing for women who do not have a family history associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA genes, the group of preventative care experts wrote on their website.

The USPSTF does, however, recommend that women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer should receive genetic counseling, and BRCA testing if recommended after counseling.

The Color BRCA gene test

Color

While the new Color BRCA genetic mutation test is not the only BRCA genetic test on the market, at $149 it is currently the cheapest, making gene testing more accessible to all women.

The Color test must be ordered by a physician, either through your own doctor, or an independent physician through the company. Users are asked to send a saliva sample -- which carries your D.N.A. -- to their lab, where it is analyzed. Results are then sent back to the user online in three to four weeks.

Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, a women's health researcher at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, told ABC News that ""one in eight [women] will get breast cancer in their lifetime.""

""So it's very important the women who are high-risk, we want them to have access to the test, and many of us believe [the price] makes it more affordable,"" Montgomery Rice said.

Devon Gant told ABC News that she used the Color test to find out that she tested positive for the BRCA 2 gene mutation.

ABC News

""It's kind of a black cloud,"" Gant said. ""It's this thing that's kind of looming in the future.""

Gant said that although there were times when she struggled with the test results, ""it's not a death sentence.""

When her aunt, Lauren Rossi, took a Color test and also got a positive result for a BRCA mutation, doctors sent Rossi for an MRI, she said.

ABC News

""That's when they found a couple of spots, said they didn't really think it was anything,"" Rossi told ABC News. ""And it came back that it was cancer.""

Rossi said that when she received the phone call she ""couldn't believe it.""

In part due to the genetic test, and the early detection, Rossi says she is now cancer-free.

""Thank God,"" she told ABC News. ""It would've been a totally different outcome, probably next February, when I went for, you know, for my mammography.""

She said that she is grateful that both she and Gant were tested for the BRCA gene mutation because it helped doctors detect cancer in her, and it empowers her niece with knowledge about her health.

""Now she knows,"" Rossi said of her niece. ""And she knows what she needs to do, and she'll stay healthy.""

'Window into the future'

Ashton describes genetic testing as showing a ""possible window into the future.""

""It doesn’t mean a guarantee because we know that genes are just one part of what determines someone’s future health risks,"" she said. ""Behavior and environment are also important.""

People should also be aware that it is possible now to test for over 30 gene mutations associated with different types of hereditary cancer, according to Ashton. Eight of those gene mutations are associated with breast cancer.

""While all the attention goes on BRCA, it is important for people to know they can have a gene mutation in other genes and it is readily available now to test for this,"" she said. ""This is a mainstream option which I think is good news for some people.""",What to know about the new affordable at-home BRCA genetic mutation test,3,ABC News

The product, called Hello, Peanut, can be mixed into puréed baby food to expose infants to peanuts starting around five months old.

The Food and Drug Administration allowed the new item, developed by a physician, to make the claim just months after the nation’s top allergy experts reversed longstanding advice on preventing peanut allergies, dropping recommendations to withhold all peanut-containing foods in early childhood in favor of early, frequent exposure, starting with peanut powder or extract for infants beginning to eat solid food. The label warns that evidence is limited.

A qualified claim means there is evidence supporting the claim, but it is not conclusive.

story_reviews_00172,"(Reuters Health) - Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to ease menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be no more likely to die prematurely than women who don’t take hormones, a new study suggests.

Many women have been reluctant to use hormones for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked the treatments containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes.

The current study, however, looked at longer-term data from the WHI study and found no increased risk of death from all causes, or from cancer or cardiovascular issues in particular, associated with hormone use.

“Women seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,” said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.

Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.

For the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin.

Women were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether.

During the study period, 7,489 women died.

Death rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn’t, researchers report in JAMA.

Younger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn’t.

For women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn’t a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study.

After 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women’s age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates.

One limitation of the study is that the WHI didn’t look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches.

Still, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women’s health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.

Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email.

With additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added.

“Hormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,” McNeil said. “The take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective.”

story_reviews_00173,"Is it time for you to begin screening for colorectal cancer? Screening looks for signs of cancer in someone who doesn't have any symptoms. The idea is that by catching cancer early, before it spreads, it's easier to treat.

Stool Screening Tests

One way to look for signs of colorectal cancer is to see if there are microscopic amounts of blood in the stool using a high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test, or FOBT. Occult, in this case, means hidden. ""It's an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps [precancerous growths in the colon],"" says Dr. Sreeram Maddipatla, medical oncologist/hematologist for the Liver Center and Pancreas Center at UF Health Cancer Center – Orlando Health. Although blood in the stool can mean there's a tumor or polyps, it can also be a sign of something much less serious, like hemorrhoids.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool DNA test:

Guaiac FOBT. This was the first stool test for colorectal screening, says Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac FOBT originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool. Guaiac FOBT detects heme – an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen – in the stool. The guaiac FOBT is not specific to human heme, Mendelsohn says, so if you consume meat before the test, it could affect the results.

To do a guaiac FOBT, you'll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis. ""[The need for three samples] is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor,"" Mendelsohn says. If you choose this method of colorectal screening, you'll need to repeat the test yearly.

When a guaiac FOBT is performed every one to two years in adults 50 to 80 years old, it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 15 to 33 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. The FIT detects human hemoglobin, Maddipatla says. It doesn't react to non-human blood, so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test. Maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac FOBT, as it only requires one stool sample (which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result). Although other conditions, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, can produce a positive result, the FIT produces fewer false positives than the guaiac FOBT, Maddipatla says, and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. The FIT is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting cancer and 20 to 30 percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps. ""The colonoscopy is still the gold standard,"" Maddipatla says.

Unlike a colonoscopy – a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum – the guiaic FOBT and FIT only detect cancers or polyps. A colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor.

Many patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy. However, if you have a positive result with either a guaiac FOBT or FIT, you may have polyps or colon cancer, and you'll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy, Mendelsohn says. ""There's no point in doing [stool tests] if you're not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards.""

FIT-DNA. You may have seen advertisements for the Cologuard FIT-DNA test. According to the NCI, Cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool (the FIT portion) as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps. The NCI says for average-risk adults who didn't have symptoms, the FIT-DNA test detected more cancers and adenomas (advanced polyps) than the FIT, but had more false positives.

Mendelsohn says there are no long-term studies on FIT-DNA, so doctors aren't sure how frequently patients should undergo it. Medicare reimburses for the test every three years, she says, and depending on the manufacturer, the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years. Mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives, which is about 10 to 13 percent. As with the guiaic FOBT and the FIT, a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy.

The Bottom Line

Adults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age 50. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.

Statins cut the risk of dying from heart disease by 28% among men, according to the longest study of its kind.

The 20-year project examined data from 2,560 men taking part in a randomised clinical trial to test the effects of statins versus a placebo.

All the men had very high levels of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, (higher than 4.9mmol/L) but had no evidence of heart disease at the start of the study.

Nearly all men over 60 and women over 75 eligible for statins, analysis suggests Read more

Researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow found impressive results among those on statins, who were given the widely-prescribed type pravastatin.

They found that compared with the placebo, there was a 27% reduced risk of coronary heart disease, a 28% reduced risk of dying from coronary heart disease, and a 25% reduced risk of coronary “events” such as a heart attack.

There was also an 18% reduced risk of dying from any cause over the 20-year period.

Senior author Professor Kausik Ray, from Imperial’s School of Public Health, said: “For the first time, we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high LDL levels.

“This legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins.”

Ray said people with lower levels of cholesterol, around 4mmol/L, who otherwise appear healthy, should also be treated with statins.

Statins prevent 80,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in UK, study finds Read more

Ray added: “This is the strongest evidence yet that statins reduce the risk of heart disease and death in men with high LDL.

“Our study lends support to LDL’s status as a major driver of heart disease risk, and suggests that even modest LDL reductions might offer significant mortality benefits in the long-term.

“Our analysis firmly establishes that controlling LDL over time translates to fewer deaths in this population.”

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “This research further demonstrates the benefits of statins for people who have high levels of cholesterol in their blood.

“It shows the enduring and long-term benefit of taking statins, including the extent to which they reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, which can only be seen in a study of this length.

MONDAY, Sept. 11, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that Opdivo -- a drug that works with the immune system to fight melanoma -- is more effective than the current standard of care for patients who've had surgery to remove advanced tumors.

The international study was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and included more than 900 patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma.

Patients were treated at 130 medical centers across 25 countries. All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care.

Both drugs are ""immunotherapies,"" which work by boosting the immune system's ability to spot and destroy tumor cells.

After a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.

According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, metastatic melanoma accounts for only about 1 percent of skin cancer cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.

""Our results demonstrate that [Opdivo] is more effective in treating patients with stage III and IV melanoma, cutting the risk of relapse by a third,"" lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Weber, professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine, said in a university news release.

""Results like this will change how we practice medicine. Hopefully, physicians will embrace the use of [Opdivo] in these high-risk patients as adjuvant therapy,"" added Weber, who also helps direct NYU's Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City.

One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed.

""Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo,"" said Dr. Gary Deutsch. He is a surgical oncologist at Northwell Health's Imbert Cancer Center in Bay Shore, N.Y.

""Not only did these patients have a better survival outcome at one year, but they had only one-third the side effects compared to Yervoy,"" Deutsch said.

The study found that patients taking Opdivo had fewer severe side effects than those taking Yervoy, at 14 percent versus 45 percent. Five percent of patients on Opdivo had to stop treatment due to side effects, compared with 31 percent of those on Yervoy. The most common side effects for both drugs were fatigue and diarrhea.

Weber added that ""the safety of [Opdivo] is very promising.""

The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. It was also published online Sept. 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Both Opdivo and Yervoy are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced (metastatic) melanoma. In some patients, the drugs are used in combination.

Dr. Michele Green is a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.

""It is amazing that there is now an alternative that is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease,"" Green said after reviewing the new study findings. ""With these advanced melanomas -- that have high risks of recurrences and have poor outcomes -- it is vital to look at alternative treatments. The future in cancer treatments lies in immunotherapy and other targeted options.""

story_reviews_00176,"An analysis of two influential studies of prostate cancer screening concludes that the much-debated test “significantly” reduces deaths from the disease, suggesting that current recommendations against routine PSA screening might be steering men away from a lifesaving procedure.

The analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was “on shaky ground” and used a “completely unverifiable” methodology that they had “never seen before,” but others praised its “intriguing and innovative approach.” There was one area of agreement, however: “I imagine it’s going to generate some buzz,” said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.

If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study’s senior author.

“If a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it’s considered a successful test,” Etzioni said. “I think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.”

Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.

The new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).

In April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA’s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)

The rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn’t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.

The finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn’t different enough from the “unscreened” (but in fact partly screened) men’s, not because PSA screening doesn’t save lives.

In an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of “lead time,” or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they’d been assigned to.

Bottom line: Screened men’s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men’s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.

Researchers not involved in the study weren’t convinced. “The concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,” Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but said they did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing the new analysis because some of its authors are colleagues of theirs.

Dr. Kenneth Lin of Georgetown University Medical Center, a former staffer at the USPSTF, said crediting PSA tests with reducing prostate cancer mortality by around 30 percent was probably an overstatement, especially since mathematical models are only models. An earlier one for the PLCO study concluded that more men died in its screening group than in the don’t-get-screened group. “Models are models,” Lin said. “No matter how sophisticated, they shouldn’t trump data from real people who participated in the randomized trials” — which in PLCO found zero lives saved from PSA screening.

A researcher associated with the Preventive Services Task Force, but who was not permitted to speak to reporters while the group is finalizing its PSA recommendation, said the panel would incorporate the new paper in its analysis. “But honestly,” he said, “I don’t know that this adds a great deal to our understanding.”","PSA saves lives, a new analysis finds. Not everyone agrees",4,STAT
story_reviews_00177,"After years of growing doubt about the value of screening men for prostate cancer, a new analysis of existing clinical trial evidence has found that when men between 55 and 70 get the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, the result is lives saved.

In 2009, a New England Journal of Medicine editorialist famously called the debate over PSA testing for prostate cancer “the controversy that refuses to die.” That comment came with the publication of two clinical trials — one conducted in the United States, the second in Europe — that drew two contradictory conclusions on prostate cancer testing.

The U.S. undertaking, called the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO) Trial, found that screening men for prostate cancer does not save lives. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer suggested that screening drove down the rate of deaths from prostate cancer by 20%.

In 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test. And in April 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force dumped the decision squarely into the laps of patients and their doctors. Some men between 55 and 69 years of age might well decide to get their PSA checked, the task force said. After hearing the ledger of pros and cons, however, others in that age bracket might just as reasonably skip the screening test, the panel concluded.

The new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, now calls those recommendations into question. The authors of the study, led by biostatistician Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, concluded that screening men over age 55 “can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for prostate cancer death.”

When men who fit the criteria for screening get the PSA test, the reduction in deaths due to prostate cancer was between 25% and 32%, the new study found.

But the newly published analysis also underscores that the value of prostate cancer screening rests heavily on which men you screen, where and for how long you conduct the clinical trial, and how you crunch the numbers.

In the end, said Vanderbilt University urological surgeon Dr. Sam Chang, the new analysis “reinforces what urological surgeons and treating physicians have thought all along: that PSA screening is helpful.”

Advertisement

But it is helpful, said Chang, only when it focuses on the right men — those between 55 and 70 — and when it is tempered by an understanding that not all worrisome findings are evidence of disease that should be treated aggressively.

Sometimes, said Chang, who was not involved in the newly published article, a man will get a problematic PSA test reading and decide not to act on it immediately or aggressively. But knowing there is a decision to be made is probably a better basis for planning than not knowing, he added.

“Over the past five to 10 years, there has been a better understanding by everyone about the harms of over-treatment,” Chang said. “You want to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment.”

Chang underscored that for two groups in particular — African American men and those with a first-degree relative who died of prostate cancer — knowing is especially important, because the risks of aggressive disease in such populations is much higher than for others. Neither group was the subject of special attention in the newly published analysis.

In an editorial published alongside the new analysis, Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center also made clear that it’s what patients and their physicians do after the PSA test that matters most.

“Unfortunately, the way screening has been implemented in the United States leaves much to be desired,” Vickers wrote. “The controversy about PSA-based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm,” he added.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer found in men, affecting 101.6 of 100,000 American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 176,000 got a diagnosis of prostate cancer and 28,000 died of it.

But a change in a man’s reading on the PSA test is a highly imperfect gauge of trouble: approximately 80% of positive PSA test results are thought to produce false-positives, creating scares that prompt men to get biopsies. And treatment, which carries with it a high risk of subsequent difficulties with sexual function, urination and bowel movements, is often unnecessary because prostate cancers are often so slow-growing they will never make a man sick.

As a result of this growing skepticism about whom to screen for prostate cancer and whether to treat it, more and more men are skipping the PSA test. And among those who get it and get back a worrisome finding, fewer and fewer are opting to treat it.

Earlier this year, a long-running clinical trial found no evidence that patients who got an early prostate cancer diagnosis and chose “active surveillance” (sometimes called watchful waiting) were no more likely to die of the disease than were men who got the same diagnosis and treated it aggressively.

It gives advanced emergency medical technicians, who are a step down from higher-level paramedics, a way to help relieve patients' pain and anxiety on what can sometimes be long trips to a hospital.

""For someone to be in pain for that extended period of time, you know we want to try to ease that,"" said Scott Brinkman, chief of emergency medical services in Stowe, a ski resort town that sees many related injuries and started using nitrous a year ago.

Nitrous oxide equipment has been sold to ambulance crews in at least 30 states in the past three years, including Maine, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas and Wisconsin, according to Henry Schein Medical, the sole distributor of the version for ambulances.

Nitrous has been more commonly used in ambulances in Europe and Australia.

Nitrous oxide is also not an opioid, a bonus as the country grapples with a drug crisis. Experts have blamed prescription opioids for spikes in overdoses, and some patients simply might not want to be given an opioid, or their injury doesn't require something so strong.

In Stowe, for example, a woman who dislocated her shoulder asked not to be given narcotics because she was recovering from addiction, Brinkman said.

The drug also bridges the gap between a cold pack and narcotics, said Michael Chiarella, director of operations at Richmond Rescue in Richmond, Vermont, which also handles many injuries suffered at a nearby ski resort.

The drug is delivered by breathing through a mask or tube that the patient holds so they can regulate how much they are getting.

""It's fast-acting and it wears off,"" said Jeremy Oleson, an advanced EMT and chief of the fire department in Twin Mountain, New Hampshire.

Nitrous was used on some ambulances in the 1980s and 1990s until the product line was sold. The portable product is now back on the market with another manufacturer.

The renewed use of nitrous on ambulances comes as some states have begun to allow advanced EMTs, which have less training than paramedics, to administer it, in line with national guidelines.

Stowe, a largely volunteer squad, is adding a unit to a second ambulance this fall at a cost of about $3,800, plus costs for disposable supplies and some cleaning agents, as well as the nitrous cylinders, which cost about $14 to refill. Brinkman estimates the drug costs less than $10 per use once the equipment is purchased.

Not all is rosy. Nitrous oxide in and of itself has the potential to be used as a recreational drug and can be misused by providers and patients, or can be stolen for personal use or sale on the street, according to the American Ambulance Association.

And while it has its advantages, nitrous oxide also can cause nausea, vomiting and light-headedness, which could cause complications with some patients, said Dr. Edward Yaghmour, chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' Committee on Obstetric Anesthesia.

The gas cannot be used in patients with head injuries, or who have abdominal pain or pulmonary concerns.

Nitrous helped Nick Chegwidden, an EMT himself, after he fell while skiing at Stowe Mountain Resort in March and the edge of his ski cut his leg.

His adrenaline kicked in, he said, but by the time the ambulance arrived 30 to 40 minutes later, he was in pain. He couldn't move his foot, so he was also having anxiety. The advanced EMT crew gave him nitrous.

""So for the transport,"" he said, ""I was calm and comfortable.""",Laughing gas makes a comeback as painkiller in ambulances,3,Associated Press
story_reviews_00179,"Jonathan Lubecky, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, returned from a deployment to Iraq with severe PTSD. His participation in a study of MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy, proved life-saving. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)

For Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.

He returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn’t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn’t stop him from trying to kill himself — five times.

Finally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.

Inside that pill was the compound MDMA, better known by dealers and partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool in years for the military’s escalating PTSD epidemic.

The MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a “breakthrough therapy” — setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.

The prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).

“We’re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],” said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.

Because of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.

But the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City’s commissioner of veteran services. “If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.”

PTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America’s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate that between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.

The affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.

And that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can’t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.

Rick Doblin founded a nonprofit advocating research into the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs. (Nirvan Mullick)

Only two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.

“If you’re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is 1 in 3, maybe lower,” said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA’s National Center for PTSD. “That’s why there’s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.”

Ecstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others — the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.

By giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.

In clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms — to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.

“If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,” said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.

It is no accident that the group — the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — chose PTSD as its argument for ending the government’s ban on psychedelics.

“We wanted to help a population that would automatically win public sympathy,” he said. “No one’s going to argue against the need to help them.”

Doblin, now 63, talks openly about his own history with drugs. He began tripping on LSD as a rebellious, long-haired college freshman in the 1970s. He says it helped him see the world and himself in new ways. He wanted to become a therapist and use psychedelics to help others achieve similar insights, but he couldn’t because LSD was already banned.

“The flaw of the early psychedelic movement was that they made it countercultural, a revolution,” he said. “Culture is dominant. Culture is always going to win.”

For a decade, he worked in construction until he came across MDMA for the first time. When the DEA moved to criminalize it in 1984, Doblin created MAPS and sued the agency. The lawsuit failed, and Doblin realized that psychedelics were perceived as too fringe to win public support.

To succeed, he decided, both he and the issue had to go mainstream.

Doblin talked his way into the public policy PhD program at Harvard University and learned to navigate the federal bureaucracy. He shaved off his mustache, cut his shaggy hair and learned to dress up.

“I used to laugh about how simple it was,” he said. “You put on a suit, and suddenly everyone thinks you’re fine.”

The external switch reflected an internal one as well. Instead of fighting government officials, he began plotting to win them over, especially those at the FDA.

And the key, he realized, was science.

Before the FDA would even talk about clinical trials for MDMA, the agency needed proof it wasn’t dangerous. Previous studies suggesting its neurotoxicity had been limited to rats. So in 1986, Doblin scraped together money to buy monkeys for those same researchers, who found the risks to be much less at human-equivalent doses than previously thought.

The next step was investigating MDMA’s effects on people. Doblin again raised money to fly psychedelic users he had befriended to Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University for spinal taps. The studies were approved by review boards at both institutions. Doblin also participated, undergoing two spinal taps.

In the two decades that followed, Doblin and MAPS inched toward progress.

The nonprofit grew from a one-man band to a staff of 25 with headquarters in Santa Cruz. It tapped into the scene in Silicon Valley — where many tech entrepreneurs have used psychedelics to spark creativity. (Steve Jobs famously praised LSD as “one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life.”)

MAPS received a $5.5 million bequest from the founder of a software company. The hipster soap company Dr. Bronner’s pledged $5 million. A professional poker player who attributed his wins to microdosing on LSD gave $25,000. Recently, an anonymous $21,000 bitcoin donation came in.

Much of that money funded small-scale clinical trials, which laid the groundwork for the last remaining hurdle: Large-scale “phase 3” trials that will begin next year, involving 200 to 300 patients in 14 locations.

If those future trials yield similar results, the FDA could approve the MDMA treatment for PTSD as soon as 2021, according to Doblin.

Yet his dream extends beyond that. He envisions a future where psychedelic treatment centers are in every city — places people can visit for enhanced couples therapy, spiritual experiences and personal growth. He believes psychedelics can help address the country’s biggest problems, including homelessness, war and global warming.

“These drugs are a tool that can make people more compassionate, tolerant, more connected with other humans and the planet itself,” he said.

That kind of talk makes many in the medical community nervous.

It’s hard to measure the exact dangers of ecstasy. Because it is not used as widely as marijuana or cocaine, for example, fewer statistics are available on overdoses or injuries. In 2011, a public health monitoring system identified 22,498 emergency department visits nationwide related to ecstasy.

MDMA researchers point out that one key difference between MDMA and street ecstasy (along with another variant called “molly”) is the street versions often contain other harmful drugs, experts say. Sometimes the pills don’t even contain MDMA.

But even in its purest clinical form, MDMA can pose risks. At high doses, it can cause the body to overheat. It can cause anxiety and increase the stress hormone cortisol. Chronic use can also cause memory impairment.

“I think it’s a dangerous substance,” said Andrew Parrott, a psychology professor at Swansea University in Wales who spent years researching the drug’s harmful effects. He worries that FDA approval for the treatment of PTSD could lead many in the public to believe ecstasy is safe for recreational use.

Other experts, however, have become increasingly intrigued by its promising results.

“Anytime you have an organization that is advocating for drugs that are illegal, it marginalizes them in the research field. MAPS still isn’t seen as mainstream. But it’s possible they have a point here,” said Krystal, the Yale psychiatrist, who has not been involved with the group’s research. “I can’t think of a single medication that doesn’t carry some side effect. The question here is whether the benefits outweigh the risk.”

For Lubecky, the drug can’t be approved fast enough.

The Marine Corps and Army veteran recalls coming home from Iraq in 2006 to discover his wife had left him, sold his motorcycle and taken his dog. That, coupled with the trauma of what he had seen at war, sent him over the edge.

On Christmas Eve, he put the muzzle of his Beretta to his temple and pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, he said, “but that microsecond after the hammer fell is when I finally felt at peace because I knew the pain would finally be over.”

One incident in Iraq in particular tormented him — a shot he took while protecting his unit. “It was a situation where the right thing to do was the immoral thing,” he said, declining to describe it in detail. “You’re looking through a scope at another human being, and you do one thing and suddenly they don’t exist anymore.”

For years he told no one about it. He would panic even thinking about it.

After he was accepted into the MDMA clinical trial in South Carolina, he found himself on a futon with two counselors on either side as the effects of the drug sank in.

“I was in such a comfortable place,” recalled Lubecky, 40, who now works in Charleston as a political consultant. “I didn’t even realize I was finally talking about it, admitting it for the first time to anybody.”

Since then, he said, he has learned to accept what happened in Iraq. And the guilt he now struggles with is the fact he got chosen over others for the clinical trial.

“I was the 26th veteran chosen for a 26-person study,” he said. “I have friends who are suffering every day like I was. But they can’t do it because it’s illegal. This could save their lives.”

story_reviews_00180,"It turns out that cholesterol isn’t the only thing you have to worry about to keep your heart healthy. In recent years, doctors have started to focus on inflammation — the same process that makes cuts red and painful — as an important contributor to a heart attack. It’s the reason doctors recommend low-dose aspirin to prevent recurrent heart attacks in people who have already had them, why they also prescribe statins, which lower both cholesterol and inflammation, and why they have started to measure inflammation levels in the blood.

But it’s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Since statins lower both, it’s hard to tell whether inflammation or cholesterol has the bigger impact on heart problems.

MORE: Why Inflammation in Your Mouth May Raise Your Risk of Cancer

But in a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces the risk of a heart attack.

In the study, 10,000 people who have already had a heart attack were randomly assigned to get injected with a placebo or different doses of a drug called canakinumab. Canakinumab, made by Novartis, is currently approved to treat rare immune-related conditions and works to reduce inflammation but does not affect cholesterol levels. After four years, the people who received the drug had a 15% lower chance of having a heart attack or stroke compared to people who didn’t get the drug. The medication also reduced the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery by 30%.

“Even I am pinching myself,” says Dr. Paul Ridker, who led the study and is director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and is a pioneer in exposing the role inflammation plays in heart disease. “This outcome is more than we hoped for. The bottom line is we now have clear evidence that lowering inflammation through this pathway lowers rates of heart attack and stroke with no change at all in cholesterol.”

About a quarter of people who have heart attacks will have another heart event even if they keep their cholesterol at recommended levels. For them, it may not be cholesterol so much as inflammation that is driving their heart disease. So the study further solidifies the fact that heart doctors should be measure inflammation as well as cholesterol in their heart patients. An inexpensive blood test that looks for a protein that rises in the blood with inflammation, called C-reactive protein (CRP), can tell doctors how much inflammation their patients have. Beginning in 2003, the American Heart Association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use CRP testing; for patients like those in the current trial, the group did not see any additional benefit to CRP testing since those patients should already be treated with statins, which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation.

But with the new results, those guidelines may change. Ridker says the findings should clarify how doctors can optimize the way they treat their heart patients — about half of people who have had a heart attack tend to have high levels of inflammatory factors, while half have high cholesterol levels. The inexpensive CRP test could identify those with higher inflammation, who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab.

The drug is not currently approved for any heart conditions, but Novartis will likely look at doing more studies to confirm its effectiveness in treating heart disease.

Perhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. In a separate study published in the Lancet using data from the same study, he found that people taking canakinumab lowered their risk of dying from any cancer over four years by 50%, and their risk of fatal lung cancer by 75%.

While the connection between heart disease and cancer may not seem obvious, Ridker says that many people who have had heart problems, like those in the study, are former or current smokers, since smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks. And smoking increases inflammation. “People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are chronically inflaming their lungs,” he says. That’s why he decided to look at cancer deaths as well as heart events in his study population.

The cancer data is still preliminary, and needs to be confirmed with additional studies, but it’s encouraging, says Dr. Otis Bradley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study. “We know that free oxygen radicals and inflammation can damage DNA and can cause cancer,” he says. “This all makes sense to me.” Studies have already shown, for example, that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer.

But whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn’t clear yet. There are a number of different inflammatory pathways, and canakinumab targets just one. Other pathways, along with new anti-inflammatory drugs, may emerge with more research.

When it comes to heart disease, however, it’s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. “Ten years from now we will be doing more personalized medicine,” says Ridker. “Some people will get more cholesterol lowering. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs. Some will get other agents that we haven’t considered yet. It’s a wonderful new era in heart disease treatment.”

story_reviews_00181,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis will seek regulatory approval this year for a new kind of anti-inflammatory heart drug, though some experts fear fatal infection risks and a high price may overshadow the medicine’s limited benefits.

Keenly awaited clinical trial results released on Sunday showed heart-attack survivors on one of three doses of canakinumab were 15 percent less likely to suffer another major cardiac event than those on a placebo.

Novartis had said in June that the drug met its goal in the study but details were only unveiled at European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona. One leading expert described the benefit as “modest”.

Patients getting canakinumab also suffered significantly more deaths from infections than those on placebo - but, on the positive side, they appeared to be at lower risk of cancer.

There was no significant difference in the rate of deaths from all causes between the placebo group and those on canakinumab.

“The modest absolute clinical benefit of canakinumab cannot justify its routine use in patients with previous myocardial infarction until we understand more about the efficacy and safety trade-offs and unless a price restructuring and formal cost-effectiveness evaluation supports it,” wrote Dr. Robert Harrington, chair of the Stanford University School of Medicine, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Canakinumab had stirred considerable scientific interest because it appears to finally deliver proof that fighting inflammation offers a promising new way to counter heart disease in patients who already get cholesterol-lowering treatment.

Subsequently, some analysts boosted their revenue estimates for the Novartis medicine into the billions of dollars, while awaiting the data announced on Sunday.

Canakinumab is already approved as Ilaris for rare autoimmune conditions.

Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s head of global drug development, said the drugmaker plans to go to regulators in the fourth quarter to seek approval for canakinumab to treat heart-attack victims with high levels of inflammation.

He downplayed critics who said the benefit was small, saying that one large subgroup in the so-called Cantos trial had shown a 27 percent reduction in cardiovascular risk.

Novartis also plans to underscore canakinumab’s potential cancer fighting properties with the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

SEPARATE TRIALS

That’s after an analysis of Cantos data found total cancer mortality among patients getting canakinumab was significantly lower than in those receiving the placebo.

Narasimhan, who said the company now plans to start separate cancer trials for canakinumab, said the drug could be particularly suitable for smokers with risks of both lung cancer and heart problems.

With the oncology findings promising but only preliminary, the company is planning additional studies in lung cancer starting next year, he said.

Ilaris now costs about $200,000 per patient annually for treating rare immune conditions and brings in some $400 million in yearly sales for the Swiss company, though its price is likely to be slashed should it win approval in the heart setting.

Novartis initially struggled with the sluggish launch of its last heart drug, the $4,500-per-year Entresto, so it is understandably concerned about the reception for canakinumab.

While Narasimhan said it was too early to discuss pricing, he argued so-called PCSK9 cholesterol drugs that cost about $14,000 annually should not be relied on as a yardstick.

“In view of the additional oncology findings, we don’t think you should just think about this as a cardiovascular drug,” Narasimhan said. “I don’t think you can necessarily just make comparisons to existing benchmarks, such as the PCSK9s.”

Even so, Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said the “marginal” data are not compelling enough to dispel what for Novartis will remain a pricing conundrum, should canakinumab’s approval be expanded for heart patients.

“If the company cuts the price of the product in its current orphan indications, then it instantly sacrifices sales which currently total about $400 million per year with the hope that future sales in a new CV setting will more than offset this,” Anderson said in a note.

“Some have wondered whether a particularly high-risk subgroup could be identified where canakinumab’s current price can be justified,” he said. “We are not hopeful here.”","Novartis hopeful for novel heart drug, despite 'modest' benefit",4,Reuters
story_reviews_00182,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had approved Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc’s treatment for a side effect caused by a commonly prescribed Parkinson’s drug, sending the shares of the drugmaker soaring in after-market trading.

The company’s shares were up 30.9 percent at $18.84 after the bell on Thursday.

A majority of patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s are treated with levodopa, whose use often leads to dyskinesia - involuntary movements that are non-rhythmic, purposeless and unpredictable.

Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating disorder in which brain cells progressively die causing patients to experience tremors, rigidity, extreme slowness of movement, impaired balance, and difficulties in swallowing and speaking.

Adamas’ Gocovri, previously ADS-5102, is the first drug cleared by the FDA to control levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The long-acting therapy is taken once-daily at bedtime.

An estimated 90 percent of levodopa-treated patients, about 200,000 people in the United States, suffer from LID, the company said.

Fluctuating levels of levodopa result in erratic periods of muscular control and involuntary movements throughout the day, disrupting activity at least half a dozen times a day.

As Parkinson’s progresses, patients are dyskinetic just after taking levodopa but increasingly exhibit “off time”, or worsening symptoms, as it wears off.

These patients have little recourse, other than opting for deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that involves blocking electrical signals from targeted areas in the brain.

With Gocovri, which targets both dyskinesia and off time, patients will be able to reclaim about 3.6 hours of their day, CEO Gregory Went said in an interview ahead of the decision.

About 50,000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the United States each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The main ingredient of Gocovri, amantadine, has been available in the market as an antiviral drug for several decades.

The company said the drug is expected to be available in the fourth quarter, and formally launched in January 2018.

story_reviews_00184,"In a long-term study of the latest treatment for peanut allergy, scientists in Australia report that an immune-based therapy helped children allergic to peanuts eat them without reactions for four years.

The study, published in the journal Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, follows up on children enrolled in an earlier study of an immunotherapy treatment, which combined probiotics with small doses of peanuts that were designed to gradually train the children’s immune systems to accept the peanut allergen rather than treat it as something foreign. Previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters’ allergic, sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts. The Australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut’s ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction. Compared to 4% of children who didn’t get any treatment, 82% of those receiving the combination therapy significantly reduced their allergic reactions to peanuts.

MORE: Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies

In the follow-up, which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy, 67% of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not get the treatment. Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.

The results are encouraging, allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction. But it may be too early to call this a cure. The researchers believe that adding probiotics to the peanut allergens may be important in improving the children’s tolerance to the food, but Dr. Anna Nowak-Wegrzyn, an associate professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital who was not involved in the study, notes that the researchers didn’t compare the effect of the probiotics themselves; they only compared children who received the probiotics along with immune therapy to those who didn’t get any treatment at all.

It makes sense that the probiotics may enhance the immunotherapy’s effect, since probiotics are beneficial bacteria in the gut, where food allergens are processed. “I think there is certainly a suggestion, but not hard proof, that the probiotics make a difference,” says Nowak-Wegrzyn. “The question for me would be if there is a difference between patients who were treated with [both] immunotherapy [in the form of low doses of peanuts] and probiotics, and those who were treated with just immunotherapy.”

That may have to wait for another study. But the new findings provide even more evidence that using peanuts to treat peanut allergy, and to re-train the immune system to be less allergic, can be effective.

story_reviews_00187,"It is the first new drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 22 years to become available in the United States. Called edaravone – brand name Radicava – its FDA approval this week was met with a wave of excitement from the media and the ALS community.

But some physicians are raising concerns over the cost of the drug and whether or not patients will be able to get it, as well as noting misconceptions about how effective at fighting this degenerative condition this drug will actually be.

Each year, doctors diagnose anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 Americans with this rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 people at any given time in the U.S. live with the disease. The majority of these patients die within two to five years of diagnosis.

The FDA approval is based on a study of 137 people with ALS published earlier this year. Patients received either a placebo pill or edaravone over a six-month period. Researchers found that those getting edaravone had a 33 percent reduction in their rate of decline in physical function.

It’s a finding that inspires hope of slowing -- but not yet stopping or reversing -- the progression of this disease.

Dr. Leo McCluskey, who leads the University of Pennsylvania’s ALS Center and was not involved in the study nor in the approval of this drug, said the findings are promising but he added that he fears they could be misinterpreted.

“Thirty percent is pretty robust,” McCluskey said. But he nonetheless added, “We have patients calling our center asking for the cure to ALS, and this is not a cure.”

And then there is the price tag. According to MT Pharma America, the company behind Radicava, the cost is around $1,000 per infusion – and treatment, which involves multiple infusions, may total about $146,000 per year.

“This is just for the drug; you also need a nurse and infusion equipment,” McCluskey said. “We don’t know who is going to cover it or what criteria will be used to decide who gets it.”

McCluskey also expressed concerns about the feasibility of ALS patients with reduced mobility going to receive daily infusions. “Imagine you’re a patient with difficulty moving around, and you now have to come in every day to receive infusions.”

And the number of infusions needed means many such trips. Edaravone is administered by an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in 28-day cycles. The initial cycle involves a daily infusion for two weeks, followed by a two-week period without infusions. Additional cycles consist of infusions for 10 days over two weeks followed by two-week drug-free periods.

In an interview with ABC News, Tom Larson, the chief commercial officer for MT Pharma America, said the company is already taking steps to streamline the process for obtaining Radicava. The company has set up a system called Searchlight, through which patients and physicians can apply for the drug, obtain benefits information, identify an infusion center and schedule an infusion. Larson said the company has partnered with over 1,100 infusion centers across the country in an effort to “make this as easy and accessible to patients as possible.”

As for the costs and coverage of the drug, Larson said insurance companies are still deciding whether they will pay for Radicava. “We are in the process every new pharmaceutical goes through as payers make a decision.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

I admit it. I have a ""mummy tummy,"" also known as ""mommy pooch."" You know, that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby — it makes you look a few months pregnant.

I've tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood, but who am I kidding? The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.

So when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, ""Why not?""

A few weeks later, I'm rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.

""We will see a dramatic change,"" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.

""You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,"" Keller says. ""That's not an unrealistic expectation.""

We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises.""

Decked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots, Keller is a personal trainer from New York City. She has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch.

There is science to back up the method, she says.

""A doctor at Weill Cornell and I did a study on the exact same program we're going to do,"" Keller says. ""And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.""

OK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller's claim.

Putting the six-pack back together

It turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.

And it's quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.

""This is such a ubiquitous issue,"" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.

And it's not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.

""People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,"" Sharma says.

The Diastasis Recti During pregnancy, the abdominal muscles responsible for a ""six pack"" stretch apart (left) to accommodate a growing fetus. After birth, the muscles don't always bounce back, leaving a gap known as the mommy pooch.

How To Test For Diastasis Recti There's a simple way to see whether you have diastasis recti: Lie flat on your back with your knees bent. Put your fingers right above your belly button and press down gently. Then lift up your head about an inch while keeping your shoulders on the ground. If you have diastasis recti, you will feel a gap between the muscles that is wider than an inch.

In rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn't just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.

""If there's a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,"" Sharma says. ""That's going to be more dangerous.""

A hernia may require surgery. ""So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there's really a true concern about a hernia,"" Sharma says.

Diastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart — specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.

""These are the muscles that give you a 'six pack,' "" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. ""People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.""

The rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. ""There shouldn't be much of gap between them.""

But during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.

That leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out — and cause mommy pooch.

To flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.

If you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you'll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.

But the quality of much of that information isn't good, Brubaker says. ""Some of it is actually potentially harmful.""

Even some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.

""You have to be very careful,"" she says. ""For example, please don't ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.""

That said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller's Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.

Most such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization's guidelines don't provide details — such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.

Plus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.

toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR

""The best way is prevention,"" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. ""The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.""

But, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.

""There's a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,"" Sharma says. ""But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.""

In fact, the few studies that have been done haven't been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.

Sharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.

""We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,"" Sharma says.

The study was small — just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller's exercise — 10 minutes a day — all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG's annual meeting few years ago.

""We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,"" Sharma says. ""We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

Now Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.

Tight and tighter

Back at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It's surprisingly simple to do.

""The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that's almost imperceptible,"" Keller says. ""OK. We're going to do another set.""

Sitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. ""Let the belly fully expand,"" Keller says.

And then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles — as far back as they'll go, toward the spine. ""Now we're going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,"" she says.

Then we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.

""Tight, tighter,"" Keller chants, rhythmically.

You can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.

The key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.

""The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,"" she says. ""So you know that you're squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you're never bulging the bellybutton forward.""

This is our fourth week of class, and we've been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it's judgment day. Time to see whether we've flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.

Keller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women's middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.

One by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.

One woman had amazing results. ""Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,"" Keller exclaims. ""That's amazing!""

How did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn't completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.

And I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.

*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti.","Flattening The 'Mummy Tummy' With 1 Exercise, 10 Minutes A Day",3,NPR

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A new treatment might open the door for more patients with advanced kidney disease to get a transplant, a preliminary study suggests.

Of the 100,000-plus Americans waiting for a donor kidney, about one-third are ""sensitized,"" said Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the Transplant Institute at NYU Langone in New York City.

Those patients face a tough situation: They harbor immune system antibodies that are primed to attack a donor organ.

The antibodies can form when a person is exposed to foreign tissue, Montgomery explained. So a patient who's had a prior kidney transplant may be highly sensitized -- meaning they have a large number of the offending antibodies.

It can also happen to patients who've had blood transfusion or ever been pregnant, Montgomery said.

It's almost impossible to find a compatible donor for those patients. But they might be able to receive a kidney from an incompatible donor if they first undergo an extensive ""desensitization"" process.

That involves various treatments -- including IV drugs called immune globulin and rituximab -- that try to quash the antibodies that would attack the donor organ.

Now the new research suggests a simple approach -- an infusion of a particular enzyme hours before the transplant -- could offer a better alternative.

Researchers found that the treatment -- dubbed IdeS -- quickly wiped out the dangerous antibodies, allowing all but one of 25 patients to have a successful transplant.

The findings were published in the Aug. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Funding for the study came from the company developing IdeS -- Hansa Medical.

Montgomery, who was not involved in the study, said he's ""never seen anything like it.""

""When you give this, all of the antibodies are gone,"" Montgomery said. ""I'm hopeful that this will turn out to be a game-changer.""

However, he stressed, many questions remain.

Critically, the enzyme does not banish the antibodies forever. They come back, Montgomery said -- and the results of that comeback vary from patient to patient.

In the study, 10 patients had an episode of antibody-mediated rejection anywhere from two weeks to five months after their transplant. That means antibodies started to attack the new kidney.

Those patients were all successfully treated with standard anti-rejection drugs, according to the researchers.

Still, it's not yet clear how the patients will fare in the long term, said Dr. Julie Ingelfinger, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

Ingelfinger, who wrote an editorial published with the study, echoed Montgomery's cautious optimism.

If larger, longer studies bolster the current findings, she said, ""this could potentially be practice-changing.""

""But,"" Ingelfinger stressed, ""only time will tell.""

Lead researcher Dr. Stanley Jordan agreed that more work is necessary.

But the findings mark another step forward for patients like these, according to Jordan, who is medical director of the kidney transplant program at Cedars-Sinai, in Los Angeles.

Traditionally, highly sensitized patients in need of a kidney have languished on waiting lists because it's so hard to find a compatible donor.

But in the past 15 years or so, desensitization has emerged as an alternative.

Last year, a landmark study proved that patients who receive transplants after desensitization live significantly longer than those who stay on dialysis.

""The outcomes have been good,"" Jordan said.

But, he added, there's clearly room for improvement.

Ingelfinger agreed. ""The desensitization protocols now in use are time-consuming, and they don't always work,"" she said, noting that they can leave dangerous antibodies behind.

Desensitization adds about $20,000 to $30,000 to the cost of the transplant, according to the University of Wisconsin's transplant center.

The new approach is quite different, Ingelfinger said.

Patients receive one infusion of an enzyme called IdeS four to six hours before the transplant.

The enzyme is derived from a strain of Streptococcus bacteria, and it essentially chops up the antibodies that would attack the organ.

Jordan acknowledged that the source ""sounds scary,"" but stressed that patients do not receive the bacteria itself -- but an engineered version of the enzyme.

In all, 25 U.S. and Swedish patients received an infusion of IdeS before their kidney transplant. All but one had a successful transplant, and none had detectable antibodies immediately afterward.

IdeS patients still received additional treatment -- including a week of immune globulin and rituximab infusions.

And as with all transplants, they needed standard anti-rejection drugs.

Because IdeS so readily banishes the offending antibodies, it might make transplants feasible for even the most highly sensitized patients, Montgomery said.

But the ""$65,000 question"" remains, he said: Can it extend the survival of the donor kidney and, ultimately, patients' lives?

IdeS is still experimental, and the only way patients could receive it is through a clinical trial. It will be ""a few years"" before it could be more widely available, Montgomery said.

It beckoned women to an evening seminar in Manhattan. There, they received a coupon for the latest in fertility management: a genetic test marketed as a way to help maximize their chances of becoming pregnant.

The hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there’s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company’s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can’t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they’re struggling with infertility.

The Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it’s worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of “Fertilome babies” on the way.

Some reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver — and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.)

The Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman’s DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions.

For example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40.

That sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who’s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare — affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 — so the absolute risk is still very small.

The $950 Fertilome test must be ordered by a doctor and requires women to get their blood drawn. Celmatix

And just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn’t mean they actually have it.

Many of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn’t explain the prevalence.

So a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn’t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information.

Without the proper context, “some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,” said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Petrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are “doomed.” He also said he sees the test as “very costly for what it’s trying to do — and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information.”

Tapping into women’s anxieties

The Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said.

Beim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing “tremendous” value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a “tiebreaker” to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize.

“It will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it’s more her eggs,” said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month.

What the test can’t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they’re wired to get pregnant from IVF — or wired to fail it. “We’re not there. We’re not claiming we’re there,” Beim said.

Beim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what’s now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug.

After shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn’t benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company.

Celmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances.

“Some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients.” Dr. John Petrozza, fertility specialist

Fertilome — not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name — launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don’t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half.

Celmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said.

But the company is also beginning to market directly to women — including younger women who aren’t trying to get pregnant yet.

The company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: “Are you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?” Another asserts: “Over 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you.”

The company’s website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There’s Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there’s Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career.

The wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online.

After questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients’ stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy.

Along with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street.

An ad beckons women to a seminar to learn about “proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.”

And on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women’s group to host a conversation about “proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.” Appetizers, wine, and beer were served — and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too.

The company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren’t yet trying to get pregnant — or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help “optimize management plans from the very start.”

DNA analysis points a patient to Walmart for supplements

Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who’ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She’s been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week.

Eyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn’t in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor.

Another one of Eyvazzadeh’s patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith.

For Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there’s nothing more important than family. She’s dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself.

That’s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They’ve seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.

“It’s gut-wrenching. You’re almost like this alien,” Smith said. “Nobody knows what’s going on, and you can’t fix the problem.”

So when Eyvazzadeh suggested that she take the Fertilome test, Smith jumped at the possibility of finally getting answers. Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, “my heart sank” when she saw her results for the first time.

She was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems.

“It’s gut-wrenching. You’re almost like this alien. Nobody knows what’s going on, and you can’t fix the problem.” Tara Smith, fertility patient

Despite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith’s genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation.

At Eyvazzadeh’s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility — and the utility of supplements — found the data “conflicting.”)

They also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids — a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids — during her third round of IVF, which she’s embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.)

Smith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what’s in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. “Now I feel like we’re armed with information,” she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she’ll ever get pregnant.

After all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn’t offer any definitive answers.

And that’s what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?

“I don’t know,” Baker recalled responding. “I probably wouldn’t do anything differently.”

She did not end up ordering the test.",Can a genetic test really boost your odds of becoming pregnant?,5,STAT

Enlarge this image toggle caption Malte Mueller/Getty Images Malte Mueller/Getty Images

Imagine feeling horribly sick, day after day, yet doctors repeatedly tell you they can't find anything wrong. That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.

Believed to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.

Many patients see the name ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they're simply tired or depressed. In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, ""brain fog"" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name ""systemic exertion intolerance disease,"" but it hasn't really stuck.)

The symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they're mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.

But, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.

""This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,"" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.

According to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, ""For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.""

What the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that ""levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.""

So why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren't measuring the right things.

Two classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate — the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn't a factor in ME/CFS — and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn't one of those linked to severity in this study.

""Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,"" Montoya says. ""We're showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.""

The multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients' responses to treatment.

What's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings ""a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.""

Indeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.

Komaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.

And in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar ""big data"" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis' own adult son.

""There is much to learn,"" Komaroff writes, in the journal. ""Hopefully, a decade from now, ""doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.""

story_reviews_00194,"Alzheimer’s disease now affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans, and after decades of feverish work, researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory, function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness.

But researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier and earlier. And that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility: that if you can catch the disease early enough — ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging, or before — some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress.

For anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders, “Is it Alzheimer’s?” the current state of dementia research raises a very real, and very wrenching, dilemma: If I can know, do I want to know?

That is, if it’s Alzheimer’s disease, would I do anything differently? Would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones, for myself?

Doctors and insurers, including the federal government, which administers Medicare, are asking some variants of the same questions: If an effective test, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 a shot, can diagnose dementia early, and distinguish Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance? Would it make patients’ lives better, or lower the cost of their care?

Newly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations. And other new research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect Alzheimer’s, and distinguish it from another form of dementia, more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available.

At the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in London last week, researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s disease on nearly 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries.

All of these study participants — largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either “mild cognitive impairment” or atypical dementia — are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer’s. The study is underwritten by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Alzheimer’s Assn. It set out to find out whether knowing — getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve — would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated, or the way that they plan their lives.

The preliminary results suggested it did. After getting the results of a PET brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits, which are the key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, roughly two-thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect.

That new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures, or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power-of-attorney assignments sooner. Some who learned that they did not have Alzheimer’s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects. Others learned they do have Alzheimer’s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs.

A second study presented in London analyzed data from several studies, and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns, brain amyloid PET scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases.

“People should know what’s coming,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Assn. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval, meaning they do not routinely pay for them. The results may guide the agency to rethink its position, she added.

The PET scan bore bad news for Ken Lehmann, who enrolled last year in the IDEAS trial, short for Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning. After his long, slow decline that has flummoxed doctors, Lehmann’s brain scan clearly showed he has Alzheimer’s disease.

The certainty that has brought has been a long time coming. When Lehmann began withdrawing from friends, forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations, he was just 58. Now, he’s 80.

Ken had always been considered a “Renaissance man” — a furniture company executive who rebuilt Porsches, played basketball and loved to entertain friends, said his wife, Mary Margaret Lehmann. But as years passed, his judgment seemed off. He would lose track of points he was making, and sometimes of where he was at.

It would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the Lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on. In 2009, they moved from Sacramento to Edina, Minn., to live with a daughter. And there, at last, they found a neurologist who, despite initial skepticism (“but he presents so well!” the doctor proclaimed), diagnosed dementia.

For the Lehmanns and many patients and families like them — as well as for neurologists — that diagnosis is often just the beginning of a deeper mystery.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most feared and most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60% and 80% of all dementia cases diagnosed. But at least seven other forms of dementia, and dementia linked to the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease, can cause loss of memory, reasoning, judgment and the ability to speak, comprehend and care for oneself.

To the estimated 16 million Americans living with some form of cognitive impairment, telling the difference could make a significant difference. Dementia forms with different origins progress differently (or sometimes not at all). They respond best to different medications, and will come to require different levels of care and treatment. Some (though not Alzheimer’s) can even be reversed with treatment.

Being able to distinguish which form of dementia a patient has should help doctors and caregivers to make better choices.

But it’s a question that until recently could be answered only after death. At that point, a postmortem examination of the brain could be done to look for the built-up clumps and tangles of beta-amyloid proteins, the overall shrinkage, and the loss of neurons in the brain’s hippocampus that are, collectively, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.

No more. Improved medical imaging technologies developed over the last decade have made it possible to peer inside the brain of a living patient, detect and measure the accumulation of beta-amyloid, and make a definitive diagnosis.

In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration took a first step in making such imaging possible, giving its blessing to the imaging agent florbetapir F18, which binds to amyloid aggregates in the brain and allows a PET scan to be used to make the diagnosis. In 2013, two new imaging agents won FDA approval, and new imaging agents and techniques promise ever more precise means to visualize and diagnose Alzheimer’s in the brain.

On Wednesday, research published in the journal Neurology suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique that can selectively turn up or down activity in different parts of the brain, could prove useful in distinguishing between Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia.

In many ways, Ken Lehmann’s symptoms fit neatly into a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. A form of cognitive impairment that typically becomes evident earlier than most cases of Alzheimer’s, FTD often affects judgment, personality and verbal communication. This form of dementia progresses as inexorably as does Alzheimer’s. But its typical course differs slightly.

As an enrollee in the IDEAS trial, Lehmann was prepared to learn what it was he had.

“I had come to the conclusion they just don’t know,” said Lehmann, now 80, from his home in Minnesota. “In seven years, my journey of decline has been very miniscule, and they don’t know why.”

It turns out, he added, “I have all the biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.”

Once he and his wife learned that, they stepped up their preparations for further decline. And they redoubled their efforts to do things that bring joy, and that may slow Ken’s decline as well.

They follow a diet rich in fatty fish, healthful fats and fruits and vegetables, and Ken does woodworking. He also sings in a Minneapolis chorus, Giving Voice, with other dementia patients. He has regained a long-lost ability to read music.

“Just not knowing is very disconcerting,” says Mary Margaret, who is her husband’s principal caregiver. “I don’t know what the timeline is, but I now know what the needs are, in terms of financial and legal needs and end-of-life issues. Those all need to be planned for ahead of time, and now we have all of that in place. To me, that’s a safety net.”

story_reviews_00195,"Scientists have slowed down the ageing process by implanting stem cells into the brains of animals, raising hopes for new strategies to combat age-related diseases and extend the human lifespan.

Implants of stem cells that make fresh neurons in the brain were found to put the brakes on ageing in older mice, keeping them more physically and mentally fit for months, and extending their lives by 10-15% compared to untreated animals.

Umbilical cord blood could slow brain's ageing, study suggests Read more

The work, described as a tour de force and a breakthrough by one leading expert, suggests that ageing across the body is controlled by stem cells that are found in the hypothalamus region of the brain in youth, but which steadily die off until they are almost completely absent in middle age.

Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York hope to launch clinical trials of the procedure soon, but must first produce supplies of human neural stem cells in the lab which can be implanted into volunteers.

“Of course humans are more complex,” said Dongsheng Cai, who led the research. “However, if the mechanism is fundamental, you might expect to see effects when an intervention is based on it.”

Previous experiments had already hinted that the hypothalamus, an almond-sized part of the brain in humans, played some role in the ageing process, but what it was remained unclear. The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.

In the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body’s nervous and hormonal systems.

To test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. “Behaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,” Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.

Next, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.

Maximum human lifespan could far exceed 115 years – new research Read more

Having proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.

“The mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing” said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.

“It is a tour de force,” said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. “It’s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives. I would love to know which brain stem cell secretions extend a mouse’s lifespan and if human stem cells make them too.”","Stem cell brain implants could 'slow ageing and extend life', study shows",4,
story_reviews_00196,"Developing a vaccine to stop HIV is thought to be among the most daunting challenges in medicine for one big reason: The virus is extraordinarily genetically diverse, even more so than the flu. So it’s difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world.

But scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV’s genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people.

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what’s called the “Ad26-env mosaic vaccine.”

The mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It’s called a “mosaic” because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes.

“One of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,” said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity.”

A word of caution, though: We’re only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising.

The mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research

In the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that’s currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.)

In the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots.

Before this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people.

We need more human studies of this HIV vaccine

But we still don’t know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don’t pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy.

“I wouldn’t use the word excited too much,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise.” It’s too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added.

As for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women.

Deaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 — but there’s still a ton of work to be done

We’ve made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease.

Researchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV.

Deaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.)

An HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV — too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate.

“A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,” Fauci said in a statement. “By exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.”",There's a promising new HIV vaccine candidate in the pipeline,4,Vox

News this summer of a flu vaccine patch sparked a lot of chatter. Could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage? Could there be fewer, or at least smaller, needles in our future?

Some companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen.

They're refining technologies that involve tiny needles, less than a millimeter long, and needle-free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second.

Some of these technologies are already available on the market, while others are still being tested.

One hundred very tiny needles

A flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public. But one version developed by Georgia Tech's Laboratory for Drug Delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial, according to a study published in The Lancet in June.

The patch, about the size of a small square bandage, has tiny, dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine. It's placed on the arm and activated through pressure. The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.

In the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.

Six months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.

People who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.

About 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab's associate director.

Now, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn't need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Georgia Institute of Technology Courtesy of Georgia Institute of Technology

And the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves.

In 2015, Georgia Tech and the pharmaceutical company Micron Biomedical won $2.5 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization.

Gomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now.

A 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. But that didn't take into account the costs of getting the patch to market.

The potential cost savings wouldn't happen until the patches were in ""routine use,"" the CDC noted.

A twist on Star Trek technology

Others in the vaccine-delivery business are taking a different approach, using a new twist on a needle-free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century.

Star Trek featured such a device, calling it a ""hypospray.""

Portal Instruments, a company that is developing jet injectors, uses technology based on work done by Ian Hunter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""Initially, we worked on microneedles,"" says the company's CEO Patrick Anquetil. ""And then Ian realized that why don't we just remove the needle altogether? And that's how this project came to be.""

Needle-free jet injectors were actually used in the 1960s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. As described by the CDC, these devices use a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. The diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite.

The devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people, including members of the armed forces.

Anquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched.

""To create the jet, you have to instantaneously create 100 times more pressure than you've got in the tire of a car,"" he says. ""Patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe.""

Others echo that sentiment.

""My 85-year-old neighbor still remembers how painful it was,"" says Ron Lowy, CEO of PharmaJet, a company that makes an FDA-approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine.

The older devices had another problem. They used the same nozzle for multiple injections, leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of PharmaJet Courtesy of PharmaJet

Today's devices have made a lot of progress, Lowy says. Now, the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler.

""It feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band,"" he says, adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all. It lasts about one-tenth of a second.

He says hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have already received the flu vaccine via one of PharmaJet's injectors.

""If you have your choice, you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this? Most of the people say, 'Yeah, I'll try that,' "" he says.

Cost remains an issue for some jet injectors. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection.

""In vaccines, what's really hard is that there's a very, very high volume, and you're competing with a needle and syringe, which is tremendously low cost,"" Anquetil says.

PharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money. The company says its flu vaccine ""starter kit,"" which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.

Nasal spray hits a roadblock

FluMist, an FDA-approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray, was widely used in the U.S. and, at one point, was even the preferred method of vaccination for children.

Then last year, in a sharp turnaround, the CDC recommended that it not be used during the 2016-17 flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year, particularly among kids.

The vaccine's effectiveness was just 3 percent, so low that ""no protective benefit could be measured"" for children ages 2 to 17, the CDC said in a statement.

In contrast, the effectiveness of the flu shot was about 63 percent for kids in that age group.

AstraZeneca, the parent company behind FluMist, says the CDC's data contradicts data from several other studies, which show the vaccine was about 48 percent effective during the same flu season. And the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in European Union markets, AstraZeneca says.

In the U.S., the CDC continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season. AstraZeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins.

""We continue to pursue a broad-based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness"" in recent years, the company said in a statement, adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem.

The company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials.",Beyond The Nasty Needle: Trying To Make Vaccines More Comfy And Convenient,3,NPR
story_reviews_00198,"The policy response to the opioid epidemic is frequently framed as a conflict: If you pull back the opioid painkillers that led to the epidemic, you are going to harm the pain patients who use these opioids to treat their pain. In effect, you’re trading one problem (addiction) for another (undertreatment of chronic pain).

A new study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, however, offers a cause for optimism: Reviewing the research so far, it found that it may be possible to reduce doses for patients in long-term opioid therapy and improve their pain outcomes. So doctors can potentially pull back the opioids that launched the current drug overdose crisis and still successfully treat pain patients.

Now, by this latest study’s own admission, the evidence is of generally poor quality. Most of the studies reviewed were of poor methodology or sample size, while only a few were of “fair” or “good” quality. The review also only looked at patients who volunteered to taper off opioids, meaning this research does not prove that involuntarily pulling patients off the drugs will lead to similar outcomes.

Suffice to say, then, a lot more research is necessary before this issue is settled.

But the new study does offer a glimmer of hope in a fairly grim opioid epidemic: Maybe it is possible to reduce the amount of dangerous opioids that patients are consuming and still alleviate people’s pain.

What the study found

For the latest review of the evidence, researchers looked at 67 studies that collectively provided data on more than 12,000 pain patients who were weaned off at least some opioids. Though the researchers found a lot of studies to pool from, they generally graded these studies as “very low” in quality and methodology.

Researchers then identified the studies — none of which were graded as “good” quality — that evaluated pain-related outcomes for patients after long-term opioid therapy was tapered. Focusing on the “fair-quality” studies, they found that after opioid dose reductions, patients on average saw improved pain, function, and quality of life.

The authors provide a few possible explanations for this: Perhaps the non-opioid pain treatments, such as physical therapy and meditation, that accompanied dose reductions simply produced better results than the opioids did. Maybe the opioids themselves caused problems that negatively impacted function or quality of life, “such as constipation, fatigue, poor sleep, and depressed mood.” It’s possible that opioid dose reduction also resolved what’s known as opioid-induced hyperalgesia, “a paradoxical response in which patients receiving opioids become more sensitive to painful stimuli.”

Or, the researchers suggested, the observational studies simply showed reverse causation — “that is, patients successfully tapered opioids because pain severity decreased.”

The findings do not mean that doctors can now simply yank patients off opioids and expect them to get better. For one, the reviewed studies generally looked at the results of tapering, when patients are slowly weaned off opioid painkillers — a process that, Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke told me, can take months or even years.

Crucially, the studies also looked at what happened when these reductions in opioid doses were paired with alternative treatments, including alternative medicines like acupuncture, interdisciplinary pain programs, and medication-assisted treatment for addiction. This is very, very different from a situation in which a patient is taken off opioids and effectively left stranded without any other form of care.

As the researchers readily admit, the study also had several major limitations. Most of the studies analyzed were of poor quality — meaning there’s a serious need for better research in this area. And the studies only evaluated voluntary reductions in opioid doses; it’s entirely possible that involuntary reductions in opioid doses would lead to sharply different outcomes.

“We should be cautious in interpreting the findings,” Joseph Frank, lead author of the study, told me. He emphasized that more research needs to be done to fill “important gaps” in our knowledge. He added, “I want patients and their doctors to use caution in applying this.”

A few pain patients will still benefit from opioids

One of the study’s implications is that opioids actually aren’t a good treatment for chronic pain. This isn’t new. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded in its 2016 summary of the research, there are simply no good long-term studies looking at the effects of opioids on long-term pain outcomes, while there are many studies showing that long-term opioid use can lead to bad results in other areas, including addiction and overdose.

That does not mean opioids are never an effective treatment for chronic pain.

As addiction and pain experts often tell me, health care can vary vastly from patient to patient. Some patients feel worse on opioids, while others report quick pain relief. Some patients experience grueling withdrawal if taken off opioids, while for others the symptoms are much less severe. Some patients are at unusually high risk for addiction, while many — most, in fact — aren’t. And so on.

In a few cases, then, opioids will still be the best answer for some individual chronic pain patients. When prescribed carefully on a schedule that works to diminish the excessive buildup of tolerance, they can work for some people. But as Stanford pain specialist Sean Mackey emphasized to me, opioids should not be a first-line treatment due to the risks, and alternatives should be tried first.

This, then, is another key caveat to the study: Its findings shouldn’t be applied to every patient. Like much of health care, each case will typically require individual evaluations to see what works.

“There are people who do well with tapering [opioids],” Stefan Kertesz, an addiction researcher at the University of Alabama Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told me. “There are people who do not do well with tapering.”

But the study suggests that getting some patients off opioids could improve their pain outcomes. The key is convincing patients that this truly can work so they buy into the treatment and genuinely follow through with it — and making non-opioid treatments for pain accessible enough that patients see them as realistic options.

Alternative pain treatments need to be made more accessible

The reality, though, is non-opioid pain treatments are often out of reach for many Americans. Patients may not have insurance to cover the treatment. Even if they do have insurance, their health plan might not cover comprehensive pain care. And even if they do have insurance and their health plan covers pain treatments, there may not — particularly in rural areas — be a nearby pain clinic or doctor who can actually provide the care these patients are seeking.

This is something the study’s authors readily acknowledge.

“It’s an important part of this challenge,” Frank said. “These non-opioid strategies that were tested in these research studies are not adequately available. Several of the studies were done in pain centers where they have expert programs, and those just are not widespread.”

In fact, the lack of access to non-opioid strategies may be one big reason that doctors resorted to opioids in the first place. The drugs offered an easy answer — if ultimately an ineffective one — to the many problems doctors faced, including patients who had complicated pain problems that physicians didn’t fully understand and tight schedules driven by the current demands of the health care system that made it hard to take the time to work through a patient’s individual problems. (More on all that in my interview with Lembke.)

To address this, Frank argued that patients need better access to pain treatments. And doctors, especially primary care doctors who are frequently the first people patients see in the health care system, also need to be better trained to deal with chronic pain.

These solutions could help a lot of people: According to one study from the Institute of Medicine, 100 million US adults suffer from chronic pain. The opioid epidemic shows that if this care isn’t made available, patients may end up resorting to drugs that can literally get them killed — or, as has been reported in other tragic cases, they may kill themselves once the pain grows too bad. (The newest study, however, noted that there is no good research yet looking at these two potential outcomes if pain patients are taken off opioids.)

“Not only do we lack the data, but I have seen and heard of countless cases of overdose and suicide from people who have been involuntarily discontinued,” Kertesz said, emphasizing this is strictly based on anecdotal observations. “One day in June, in my inbox were 42 deaths.”

Opioid policy is a balancing act

The findings show the balancing act of opioid policy: Even if doctors need to pull back opioids, they must be careful to ensure patients suffering from debilitating pain and other problems can still meet their other care needs.

It’s not just pain care. When dealing with opioid users who are addicted, doctors and policymakers also need to ensure that addiction treatment is available. Otherwise, these patients will likely try to find another source of drugs — even if it means resorting to a riskier opioid, such as heroin or fentanyl, to satisfy their cravings.

There’s good evidence this happened to many — but not all — opioid painkiller users: A 2014 study in JAMA Psychiatry found 75 percent of heroin users in treatment started with painkillers, and a 2015 analysis by the CDC found people who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin.

The fundamental problem is many of these patients don’t get addiction treatment once they lose access to painkillers or before they progress to heroin or fentanyl. Without the option of treatment, opioid users’ only answer to averting dependence-induced withdrawal becomes harder drugs. Yet based on a 2016 report by the surgeon general, only 10 percent of Americans with drug use disorders get specialty treatment.

That doesn’t mean that reducing prescriptions is a mistake. By stopping doctors from unscrupulously prescribing the drugs, governments can potentially stop opioids from flowing to new users who didn’t really need the drugs and could have developed addictions had they been allowed to get painkillers.

But the reduction has to be paired with increased access to addiction care — and it frequently hasn’t been.

Beyond addiction treatment, Kertesz argued that policymakers should also address some of the underlying conditions that drive addiction. He emphasized the need for broader mental health care, given that people often have mental health issues that can make addiction more likely.

“Who is at higher risk — John with PTSD and a dose of 10 milligrams a day, or James, who has no PTSD and is on 200 milligrams a day?” Kertesz said. Based on his reading of the data, “it’s John with PTSD on the 10 milligrams.”

But as is true for addiction and pain treatments, adequate mental health care is also out of reach for many patients — showing just another way that the US health care system isn’t built to adequately address the full needs of patients.

All of this shows why the policy solution to the opioid epidemic isn’t as easy as simply pulling back prescription opioids: To avoid exacerbating existing problems or causing new ones, policymakers need to consider the other needs of people who were perhaps getting opioids they didn’t really need.",A new study suggests it’s possible to get people off opioids and improve their pain,5,Vox

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as ""floaters,"" a new study finds.

""Floaters often arise as the vitreous -- a gel-like substance that fills the eye -- contracts and pulls away from the back of the eye,"" explained ophthalmologist Dr. Naomi Goldberg, who reviewed the new research. She works at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York City.

Floaters become more common with age, and although some people simply get used to them, others are bothered by them or their vision is impaired.

The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. They explained that, currently, there are three management options for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and a laser procedure known as YAG vitreolysis.

However, Shah and Heier said there are few published studies on the laser treatment's effectiveness in treating floaters.

The new study involved 52 patients with floaters who received one session of either the YAG laser treatment or a ""sham"" placebo laser treatment.

Six months after treatment, 54 percent of patients in the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in floater-related visual disturbances, compared with only 9 percent of those in the placebo group.

Nineteen patients (53 percent) in the YAG group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms, compared with none of the patients in the placebo group, the researchers added.

The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed.

There were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology.

A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. ""Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,"" the study authors wrote.

For her part, Goldberg said that although ""there was significant improvement in patients' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen,"" these findings are early and ""it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure.""

story_reviews_00200,"When Sierra Riddle stormed into the conference room at Denver’s child protective services office, the director of the agency was seated there, along with her son’s team of doctors, top administrators from the Children’s Hospital Colorado oncology department and lawyers. She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. “I’m done with this shit,” she remembers saying. “I’m done with you guys bullying us.”

Then, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors’ orders. “Listen: Here’s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn’t give it to him, he would relapse and die.”

But Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive—thriving, in fact—even though he’d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That’s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director—whom by then she knew by first name—to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son’s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children’s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon’s case for this story.)

Landon’s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that’s any parent’s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders.

RELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong

In January 2013, nearly four months after Landon’s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism—especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle’s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.

By the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon’s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two—which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan—were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.

A Key in the Lock

As laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.

When Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis—cannabinoids—have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn’t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn’t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very difficult for scientists to conduct clinical trials on people. However, that may change as other nations, such as Israel, take the lead and fund marijuana research.

Ryan David Brown for Newsweek

The findings so far from published lab studies suggest cannabidiol (CBD), one of more than 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, targets certain pathways in leukemia. The evidence indicates that leukemia cells have a high number of cannabinoid receptors—primarily the receptor CB2. The proteins on the cell membrane (receptors) recognize the chemical compound, CBD. The shape of the receptor mirrors the shape of the compound, enabling the CBD to land and attach to the cell. “It’s like a key in the lock,” says Dr. Bonni Goldstein, medical director of Canna-Centers in Los Angeles and the medical adviser to Weedmaps.com, a resource for people seeking specialists to oversee their medical cannabis treatment. “When compounds such as cannabidiol bond to receptors, it causes the cell to die.”

Further studies are needed to verify that CBD could potentially kill leukemia, says Robert McKallip, an associate professor of immunology at Mercer University School of Medicine, who conducted some of the earliest research on the anti-leukemia properties of compounds found in cannabis. McKallip suggests cannabis could be used along with other treatments for leukemia. “Combined with other targeted therapies, which again, specifically target the leukemia, you give it a one-two punch and hopefully reduce side effects and improve efficacy of treatment,” he says.

Riddle isn’t a doctor, but she theorizes that while the chemo initially cleared Landon’s cancer, it’s the cannabis that has kept his disease from coming back. Oncologists who treat pediatric patients often tell families that when the five-year mark passes, their child is in the clear. It’s been nearly five years since Riddle sat in that conference room meeting; Landon is still cancer-free. Riddle says that once he hits the five-year mark this fall, he’ll set a precedent for pediatric leukemia patients in the U.S., and maybe even worldwide.

‘He’s Dying’

Riddle, a single mother, was willing to do whatever it would take to rid Landon of the cancer in his blood that had spread to his brain and formed a tumor in his chest the size of a large grapefruit. She desperately wanted to trust the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City, where her son was diagnosed at age 2, and who admitted to her that they weren’t sure they could save his life.

She knew the leukemia treatment protocols are backed by decades of research. But they are infamously rough for a child and drag on for years. First, there would be several months of aggressive inpatient chemo and other therapies for what’s known as “remission reduction.” After that, even when blood work showed the disease had entered remission, Landon would need years of chemo and monitoring—called “consolidation”—to make sure his body wasn’t harboring leukemia cells.

This aggressive approach is one of the main reasons pediatric leukemia, depending on its more specific classification, has at least an 80 to 90 percent survival rate. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society estimates that nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed in the U.S. with some form of leukemia in 2017. For most of the kids who go through the entire course of treatment, the illness turns out to be a mere blip on the screen of childhood. Riddle hoped the same would be true for her son. But Landon appeared to be among a small percentage of children with leukemia for whom the treatment was unbearable, excruciating. The chemo caused him to vomit up to 50 times a day, which made it difficult for him to speak because his esophagus was burned and closed up. The chemo had compromised his immune system so severely that he caught every bug in the hospital, just about every strain of stomach viruses, influenza and the common cold. He eventually developed numbness, tingling, pain and weakness (neuropathy) in his feet and ankles, and was no longer able to walk.

Within the first 90 days of treatment, Landon lost half his body weight. He stopped eating for more than a month. He needed blood and platelet transfusions. Doctors kept adding prescription after prescription to alleviate the side effects of treatment—narcotics, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs, prescriptions for pain. “The sad thing is they didn’t seem to help Landon,” she says. “At this point, they kept telling us we have to keep going. I said, ‘He’s dying. It’s very apparent that he’s dying.’”

Landon began to refuse chemotherapy and turn into a “little psychopath,” says Riddle. He kicked and screamed when nurses forced pills into his mouth, so eventually everything needed to be administered with an IV. “The chemo actually has healed a lot of kids, but it almost killed me,” he says.

Ryan David Brown for Newsweek

Most children with leukemia go into remission within the first 30 days of treatment, which was why Landon’s doctors insisted on several more years of chemotherapy, says Riddle. By the time Landon was nearing the end of his first stage of treatment, Riddle says her son was on the brink of death. The doctors told her to bring him home for a two-week break from chemo, adding that they would arrange to send a hospice nurse—an ominous hint that Landon was about to die.

A plea for help posted on Facebook by Riddle’s mother, Wendy, led the family to a group of brothers in Denver, the Stanleys, who were cultivating cannabis for medicinal purposes and had made the news for a strain they called Charlotte’s Web. Riddle and her mother had seen the story about Charlotte Figi, a 6-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome, a rare type of epilepsy that was unresponsive to standard treatment. She had up to 300 seizures per day. But the seizures stopped when she began taking CBD oil supplied by the brothers.

The Stanleys visited the Riddles in Utah to educate them about Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—the psychoactive chemical in the plant—and CBD. She decided to start Landon on cannabis. But to do that, the family would need to leave Utah, where all cannabis is illegal. So Riddle and Landon moved in with the brothers for about a year, says Joel Stanley, the CEO of the company that is now known as CW Hemp. “It was just so sad to see someone that young and that small going through such harsh treatment,” Stanley says of Landon. “He also had elements of what I know a lot of folks would call ‘chemo brain.’ He would get very frustrated and very angry, all normal because his little body was just being invaded by this intense medication and rounds of chemotherapy treatment.” Throughout that year, Riddle and her son traveled back and forth from Colorado to Utah, so he could continue chemo, but this time with the aid of cannabis, to make treatment more bearable. That meant Riddle had the drug on hand, and Landon was under its influence while in Utah, which made mother and son both felons.

RELATED: Personalized cancer vaccines edge closer after success in human clinical trials

Nearly all of the children the brothers had worked with by then were refractory epilepsy patients. The Stanleys had gotten their start a few years before with adults who wanted to manage cancer, and Landon was their first pediatric cancer patient.

Riddle began her son on Charlotte’s Web CBD oil and eventually added THC. As Riddle titrated the THC dosing, she slowly weaned her son off the narcotics prescribed for him by his doctors in Utah. Stanley says the combination of CBD oil and THC helped Landon deal with the side effects of chemotherapy and, based on limited existing lab research, made it more likely that the cannabis could kill the cancer as well. “If the cannabinoids do in his body what they have proven to do in petri dishes and in mice, why not throw the book at them?”

Ryan David Brown for Newsweek

By then, CNN had started to follow Landon’s story. The network planned to broadcast the segment after he and his mother had returned to Utah, packed up their car with their possessions and drove to their new home in Colorado, where Landon could continue to take cannabis. But CNN aired a promotion for the premiere of the episode before they had left for Colorado. The oncologist at the hospital in Utah who oversaw Landon’s treatment granted them discharge anyway and told Riddle she better leave the state immediately.

Riddle says she was shocked to find that the doctors at the children’s hospital in Denver weren’t on her side. She says the hospital called CPS on her more than a dozen times when it became aware that she was no longer complying with treatment.

That is why she ended up in that conference room with a cannabis researcher, who was there to explain why the drug could help patients like Landon. He was the only person in the medical field she could find who would speak on her behalf. “It was a big slap in the face that not a single doctor would come forward to help us,” she says. “They were all afraid of losing their medical license. They were afraid of the government. They were afraid of what it would look like if they came forward in the name of cannabis.”

In the end, CPS supported Riddle. Results from blood tests, a bone marrow biopsy and spinal tap proved Landon no longer had leukemia, not even the microscopic kind, she says. Riddle says the CPS director called the hospital and ordered it to have Landon’s chemo port removed and discharge him from the hospital.

Today, Landon is still coping with the impact of his treatment. In addition to digestive problems, he has post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. The cannabis vape pen helps with that, says Riddle. She says the cranial radiation he had to endure caused some neurological deficits, and Landon says he worries that he’ll be sick forever.

But there’s so much good news here. He’s alive, and he and his mother are no longer just “medical marijuana refugees.” They’re also activists. Along with other parents, she helped draft a bill and pass a state law that allows Landon and other children like him with chronic illnesses to take cannabis at school. (Since the drug is federally illegal, it had been illegal at school. That’s no longer the case in Colorado.)

They’ve testified in California on behalf of a medical marijuana caregiver whose home was raided by the federal government, helping the man avoid a 35-year jail sentence. The mother and son have also traveled back to Utah to appear at a state congressional hearing for a medical marijuana bill that’s been shot down twice, which means they won’t be going home anytime soon.

At public appearances, Riddle does most of the talking, but she says as Landon has grown up, he has become more aware of his health problems stemming from his cancer treatment. And also angrier. “Eventually, he’ll be the one telling the story, and I’ll just be the one supporting him.”",Cancer and Kids: Is Medical Marijuana the Answer?,4,Newsweek

When doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig’s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans.

“We were hoping for a little improvement,” remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. “Nobody was hoping for zero cancer.”

The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free.

Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients’ own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers.

If the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy — “a true living drug,” said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development.

The CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so.

And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy’s use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example.

The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission.

Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure.

It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient.

Once inside the person’s body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically.

Novartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. “CAR-T is not the EpiPen,” he said. “This is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science.”

The biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use.

“Treating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,” said Stephan Grupp of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital’s cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis’s global trial. “The efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention.”

One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said.

To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others.

Grupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead.

The young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy.

“I said, ‘Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,’ ” recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. “But Steve said, ‘Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.’ ”

After she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab.

She was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone.

The approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then.

There are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches.

For the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful.

The pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June’s wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells.

Fast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn’s first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died.

But after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl’s to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews.

The pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility.

With FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy’s development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. “Usually everything is developed first for adults,” he noted recently, “and children are an afterthought.”

story_reviews_00203,"Finally, the world might be catching a break when it comes to drug-resistant gonorrhea.

A new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.

The research, conducted in New Zealand, found that the gonorrhea rate among teens and young adults there who had received a meningitis B vaccine during an emergency campaign in the early 2000s was significantly lower than the rate seen in people of the same age who weren’t vaccinated.

advertisement

Researchers in Quebec say they saw the same phenomenon after a meningitis outbreak there, and previously published data from Cuba and Norway also hint of the vaccine’s unexpected benefit.

“It’s quite probably real,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, lead author of the New Zealand article and head of immunization research and vaccinology at the University of Auckland.

The findings are observational. Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.

The last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.

“While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.

Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.

Meningitis is a condition — inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord — that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.

One of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.

Despite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.

Meningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.

Because of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.

There are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.

That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.

“A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. “And what’s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.”

New Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.

Petousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn’t received the meningococcal B vaccine.

The study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.

The single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.

Dr. Jean Longtin, head of the province’s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.

“In Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,” said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. “Gonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it’s following the rest of the province.”

It is not clear how long the protection — if it’s real — will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.

“Mathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,” Kate Seib, of Australia’s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study.","Vaccine shows protection against gonorrhea for first time, study says",4,STAT

Previous research had already offered strong hints that coffee isn’t bad for you, and might actually be good for you. But those studies generally involved fewer people, most of whom were of European descent.

A team from the National Cancer Institute, USC and the University of Hawaii sought to correct that by examining coffee-drinking habits in 185,855 Americans who were participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study, which has been tracking volunteers since 1993. On average, each volunteer was followed for 16.2 years.

Compared with the 16% of people who didn’t drink coffee at all, those who downed two or more cups each day were about 18% less likely to have died during the study period. In addition, those who drank just one to six cups of coffee per week were 12% less likely to die. Both of these figures were calculated after taking into account known risk factors for early death, such as smoking (which is often paired with coffee drinking), diet and body mass index.

When the researchers examined whites, blacks, Latinos, Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians separately, they “found no indication that the associations varied by race/ethnicity,” according to their report. The link between coffee and longevity was statistically significant in all groups except for the Native Hawaiians. The researchers said this was probably because there weren’t enough of them in the study to rule out the possibility that the link was just a fluke.

The study authors also compared coffee drinking with each of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. (which combined to account for 81% of the 58,397 deaths that occurred during the study period). The more coffee one drank, the less likely he or she was to die of heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke, diabetes or kidney disease. Coffee apparently had no effect on the risk of dying of influenza or pneumonia, Alzheimer’s disease, accidents or suicide.

Until now, there hasn’t been much data to go on regarding coffee and health risks in people who aren’t white. Without it, researchers couldn’t say whether the inverse association observed in people of European descent would apply to people of other backgrounds as well.

Now they can see that it does. Not only is this useful information to coffee drinkers, it also suggests that there’s a biological explanation for the link. (More on that later.)

A second study mined data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study to see whether there was a link between coffee and early death among 521,330 people from 10 countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). These volunteers were tracked for an average of 16.4 years.

Once again, the researchers (most of whom were from Europe) found that the top 25% of coffee drinkers in each nation were less likely to die during the study period than their countrymen who shunned coffee altogether. After accounting for smoking, diet and other factors, the authors calculated that the risk of early death was 12% lower in men and 7% lower in women.

As with the American study, the European team “found no evidence” that coffee was linked to better health only for people in certain countries.

Both studies found similar results for people who drank decaffeinated coffee as for people who drank the real thing.

Though the two studies involved hundreds of thousands of people, they weren’t designed to show that drinking more coffee caused people to live longer; that would require a randomized trial.

However, there are reasons to think that compounds in coffee would reduce the risk of premature death, according to an editorial that accompanies the studies.

For instance, the polyphenols found in coffee act as antioxidants, helping cells cope with the damaging effects of molecules called free radicals. In addition, genes related to caffeine metabolism also influence things like blood pressure and cholesterol.

Both groups of researchers also noted that previous studies have linked coffee drinking to improvements in the body’s liver function, sensitivity to insulin and inflammation.

The editorial concluded that it was still “premature” to recommend coffee as a way to “reduce mortality or prevent chronic disease.” But the results should alleviate any fears that there’s something dangerous about drinking up to five cups of coffee each day, the authors added.

Considering that an estimated 2.25 billion cups of coffee are consumed somewhere in the world each day, that’s something to celebrate with an espresso, a latte, a cappuccino or a regular cuppa joe.

story_reviews_00205,"Two personalized cancer vaccines have been found to be safe and effective at treating people with melanoma, scientists have announced.

Cancer vaccines that are personalized to the patient—designed to help the immune system identify tumors as foreign bodies and destroy them—have been considered as a potential treatment for a number of years. But working out the unique mutations of each person’s cancer, a time-consuming and complicated process, must first be identified before a vaccine can be developed for them.

In two studies published in the journal Nature, researchers have shown promising results from Phase I clinical trials. While they are very small scale—one was on six participants, the other 13—the findings mean researchers can move ahead with the vaccines, which could potentially lead to new, more effective cancer treatments.

In the first study, scientists led by Catherine Wu developed a vaccine for people who had been treated for melanoma with surgery, but who had received no other treatment. They sequenced the DNA from the tumors then created a personalized vaccine that contained neoantigens (targets for the immune response) for predicted mutations.

Six patients were given a full series of vaccinations, including five priming injections and two booster vaccinations. Four of the six had no recurrence of the disease after 25 months.

In the other study, by Ugur Sahin and colleagues, tested a personalized vaccine based on RNA (an essential link in the production of proteins encoded by DNA). They used a similar approach to Wu and her team to identify the mutations, then tested the vaccine on 13 people who were being treated for melanoma. All participants were found to have a boosted immunity against the antigens specific to their tumors. Eight were still tumor free after 23 months.

Both vaccines were deemed safe and are expected to be taken forward for further research.

These vaccines are not necessarily the future of personalized cancer treatment. Cornelius Melief, from the Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, said in an accompanying News & Views article that controlled, randomized Phase II clinical trials will be needed to work out if the vaccines are effective. He added, however, that the studies confirm the potential of cancer vaccines.

Elizabeth Williams, from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology, tells Newsweek the two studies “describe tantalizing complementary and consistent results in Phase 1 trials in melanoma patients using vaccines.""

""The vaccines are personalized for each individual’s tumours by harnessing technologies that enable the comprehensive analysis of the molecular fingerprint of the tumour,” she says. “The data shows that it is a safe and well tolerated strategy that stimulates relevant anti-tumor immune responses.”

However, the treatment has its downsides: “As the vaccine therapies are designed and generated specifically for each individual there is a lag time from enrollment to commencement of treatment—approximately four months—which may be too long from some patients with advanced cancer. As technologies and processes continue improve this is likely to be reduced,"" she continues.

“It is still unknown whether these vaccines will extend the survival of cancer patients, or whether they are more effective than other recently developed immunotherapies. Additional clinical trials will be required to determine the utility of these individualised neoepitope vaccines.”

Catherine Pickworth, science communication officer at Cancer Research UK said: “The promising results from these two small, early-stage studies show that personalized cancer vaccines designed to treat skin cancer are safe to use, and that for some patients, they can successfully harness the power of the body’s own immune system to kill cancer cells. The next step will be to test these personalized vaccines in larger clinical trials to see if they are better than existing treatments, if they improve survival, and what their long-term side effects could be.”",Cancer Breakthrough: Personalized Melanoma Vaccines ‘Safe and Effective’ in First Human Clinical Trials,4,Newsweek
story_reviews_00206,"The road to snuffing out cigarettes once and for all can be a long one.

“I think the big thing for people to remember is that it usually takes multiple attempts to be successful at quitting smoking,” says Dr. Valerie Bonne, a pulmonologist at Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who oversees the health system’s smoking cessation program. “So just because you’ve tried in the past and haven’t been successful doesn’t mean you aren’t going to be successful in the future.”

In fact, research published last year in BMJ Open, an online, open access journal, found that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before they finally kick the habit. Along with being persistent, experts like J. Lee Westmaas, strategic director of tobacco control research at the American Cancer Society, recommend trying lots of different approaches to smoke out the leading cause of preventable death. “I would say use as many aids as you can,” he says.

For those trying to quit, one new quit aid on the horizon will be easily accessed with an internet connection and a smartphone, tablet or computer: tailored emails.

Research led by Westmaas and published in May in the journal Tobacco Control looked at the effect of sending multiple emails to smokers during a quit attempt that were customized based on information provided by those individuals, such as quit date, their top two reasons for quitting, top five triggers for smoking and intended use of cessation medications. The findings showed that approach yielded quit rates that were higher than for those who received a single, non-tailored email containing links to smoking cessation resources. Self-reported rates of abstinence from smoking at six months after enrollment in the randomized controlled trial were 36 percent in the multiple email group compared with 26.5 percent in the single email group.

What’s more – though smokers are encouraged to try different methods of quitting – the research found the emails worked as a stand-alone approach. Westmaas says some emails were tailored based on whether study respondents planned to use nicotine replacement therapy, which has been found to be helpful for those seeking to quit smoking. Those study participants who weren’t planning to use NRT received an email explaining why use of NRT is actually a good thing, he says. Those receiving multiple emails who planned on using NRT got messaging outlining all the different kinds of NRT.

“Interestingly though, when we looked at whether or not people had used NRT, our results were the same. So even when we controlled for use of NRT, we still found an effect of the intervention,” he says – that is, receiving multiple, tailored emails helped people quit smoking regardless. “The intervention was effective whether or not you use nicotine replacement therapy.”

One of the study’s limitations was that those who participated were generally well-educated. The majority were white, and only 20 percent reported a high school education or less, suggesting the possibility that results may not necessarily be generalizable to less educated or other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers wrote. They suggest that future research should examine how well tailored emails worked for these and other groups, such as cancer survivors or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex groups.

At present, the email program studied isn’t available to the general public. But Westmaas says the American Cancer Society aims to make a similar program available soon. “We hope that by the beginning of next year we’ll have something ready,” he says, adding that it could be earlier depending on the success of efforts to secure funding for the program.

In the meantime, those who wish to get support for quit attempts but prefer to receive it in a way that fits with an on-the-go lifestyle can opt to receive text messages to support a quit attempt as well – like through smokefree.gov, a website created by the Tobacco Control Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute. NCI also offers QuitPal, a free app for iPhone or iPad, for a quit assist. The app has numerous interactive features, such as tracking smoking habits with a calendar and providing tips to deal with cravings. It also allows users to connect with social media, where they can see loved ones' personalized video messages to support their progress.

The point, however support is provided, is to deliver it in a way that best suits the individual. “It seems like people have preferences for how they want to receive information, especially about quitting,” Westmaas says.

While some gravitate toward group smoking cessation classes, for example, others prefer to talk one-on-one with a counselor or on a smoking quitline, like 1-800-QUIT-NOW (also affiliated with NCI). Others prefer less intrapersonal interaction, and technology provides a way to reach more people trying to quit. Some people in rural areas may not have access to smoking cessation programs, says Mary LeVasseur, manager of community health and wellness at Lancaster General Health, who’s responsible for the health system’s tobacco prevention and treatment programs.

The email approach is not meant to replace other options for quitting, Westmaas emphasizes, but rather to provide an additional one.

Experts point out, in particular, that medications and counseling in combination can be a powerful combination – even more effective than either alone. However, medications Chantix and Zyban are also associated with risks ranging from depressed mood, hostility and aggression to suicidal thoughts. “Most of the medication options and the nicotine-replacement options are fairly well tolerated” and effective, Bonne says. But experts say its important to keep doctors in the loop when issues arise to determine if medications or NRT should be stopped.

If using NRT to break a tobacco addiction, talk with a health provider if you experience nausea, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, fast or irregular heartbeat, “mouth problems” with the lozenge or gum or redness or swelling of the skin around an NRT patch that doesn’t go away, the Food and Drug Administration recommends. Taken by mouth, the lozenges can cause a warm or tingling sensation; and users are urged to seek medical attention right away if they experience a severe allergic reaction – which may be marked by rash, itching, swelling of the mouth or difficulty breathing – or other serious side effects.

With any attempt to quit, experts say it’s important to take stock of even small successes – like not smoking for a short period, even if it doesn’t last. “We look at tobacco dependence as a chronic disease. So that’s the most important thing – knowing that people go through many different cycles of abstinence and remission,” LeVasseur says.",You’ve Got Mail About Quitting Smoking,5,U.S. News & World Report
story_reviews_00207,"And that duck on a plane? It might be an emotional-support animal prescribed by a mental health professional.

The trend, which has accelerated hugely since its initial stirrings a few decades ago, is underpinned by a widespread belief that interaction with animals can reduce distress — whether it happens over brief caresses at the airport or in long-term relationships at home. Certainly, the groups offering up pets think this, as do some mental health professionals. But the popular embrace of pets as furry therapists is causing growing discomfort among some researchers in the field, who say it has raced far ahead of scientific evidence.

AD

AD

Earlier this year in the Journal of Applied Developmental Science, an introduction to a series of articles on “animal-assisted intervention” said research into its efficacy “remains in its infancy.” A recent literature review by Molly Crossman, a Yale University doctoral candidate who recently wrapped up one study involving an 8-year-old dog named Pardner, cited a “murky body of evidence” that sometimes has shown positive short-term effects, often found no effect and occasionally identified higher rates of distress.

Overall, Crossman wrote, animals seem to be helpful in a “small-to-medium” way, but it’s unclear whether the critters deserve the credit or something else is at play.

“It’s a field that has been sort of carried forward by the convictions of practitioners” who have seen patients’ mental health improve after working with or adopting animals, said James Serpell, director of the Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “That kind of thing has almost driven the field, and the research is playing catch-up. In other words, people are recognizing that anecdote isn’t enough.”

AD

AD

Using animals in mental health settings is nothing new. In the 17th century, a Quaker-run retreat in England encouraged mentally ill patients to interact with animals on its grounds. Sigmund Freud often included one of his dogs in psychoanalysis sessions. Yet the subject did not become a research target until the American child psychologist Boris Levinson began writing in the 1960s about the positive effect his dog Jingles had on patients.

But the evidence to date is problematic, according to Crossman’s review and others before it. Most studies had small sample sizes, she wrote, and an “alarming number” did not control for other possible reasons for a changed stress level, such as interaction with the animal’s human handler. Studies also tend to generalize across animals, she noted: If participants are measurably soothed by one golden retriever, that doesn’t mean another dog — or another species — will evoke the same response.

Even so, media headlines are often about the happiness bounce. Hal Herzog, a Western Carolina University psychologist who has long studied human-animal interactions, recalls a 2015 study on the health benefits for children of having a pet dog. “Here’s a reason to get a puppy,” NBC announced. “Kids with pets have less anxiety.”

AD

AD

That’s actually not what the study concluded. The authors did find that children with dogs had lower anxiety based on screening scores than children without dogs. Still, they cautioned that “this study does not answer whether pet dogs have direct effects on children’s mental health or whether other factors associated with acquisition of a pet dog benefit their mental health.”

It was a classic case of conflating correlation and causation, which Herzog says is common. Cherry-picked positive results also are a problem, as he says happens in promotional materials from the Human-Animal Bond Research Initiative (HABRI). The pet-industry backed organization funds research on the topic.

“The number of papers I see that start out, ‘It is now well-established that there are health benefits from owning pets’ — that drives me crazy,” Herzog said. “Yes, there’s literature that supports that. But there’s also literature that doesn’t find that.”

HABRI Executive Director Steven Feldman takes a more positive view of the science while acknowledging that more research needs to be done. “Just like getting vegetables and getting exercise, I would say having animals in our lives is also an essential element of human wellness,” he said.

AD

AD

To many animal lovers and pet owners, the back-and-forth might sound horribly wonky. There’s something intuitive about the good feelings animals give us. Why over-analyze it?

Alan Beck does not disagree. Beck, who directs the Center of the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, cites one common theory for why animals might be therapeutic. It’s called the biophilia hypothesis, and it argues that humans evolved a built-in need to affiliate with other living beings.

“Throughout history, animals gave us some comfort. So if it works for you and me in a relatively normal environment, maybe it has a special role for someone who has a depression and stress disorder — that just makes sense,” he said. “The literature does show it’s not bad. And that’s just as important.”

Focusing too much on scientific support sometimes feels like a form of “physics envy,” Beck added, “where you try to quantify everything without appreciating it.”

But there are good reasons for rigorous research on animals and mental health. In 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would not cover costs of service dogs for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, citing “a lack of evidence to support a finding of mental health service dog efficacy.” The department is now in the midst of a multiyear study on the topic, which could lead to government funding for these pooches.

AD

AD

Another reason, the scientists say, is for the animals’ sake. Crossman pointed to a 2014 incident at Washington University in St. Louis as an example of animal therapy gone wrong. A bear cub brought to campus during finals week nipped some students, causing a rabies scare that almost ended with the animal being euthanized. More generally, Serpell said, the popular idea that pets make you happier “is not a harmless distortion. … If the public believes that getting an animal is going to be good for them, many times an unsuitable person will get an unsuitable animal, and it doesn’t work out well for either.”

The research is getting stronger, in part because funding is growing — from HABRI as well as from a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health and the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition. Crossman’s recent study at the Yale Innovative Interactions Lab was among the work being supported.

It relied not just on the Labrador retriever Pardner but seven other certified therapy dogs. Several times a month over much of the past year, they hung out at the university for 15-minute sessions with children who had just finished two stressful tasks: spontaneously crafting stories and telling them to strangers, followed by doing math problems.

AD

AD

The strangers were the researchers, and their mission was to assess whether the kids, ages 10 to 13, would find their time with the dogs to be therapeutic. The study was designed to avoid some of the pitfalls that Crossman has seen elsewhere, which is why some of the 78 young participants got to play only with a fuzzy blanket — because tactile stimulation is known to reduce stress — and why others simply waited for the 15 minutes.

“Without the controls, the changes could be due to all kinds of things, like the fact that lots of time has passed,” Crossman said. “Kids are actually pretty good at coping.”

The children completed questionnaires to assess their mood and anxiety before and after; spit samples, to measure the “stress hormone” cortisol, were taken at three points. At the end, all the kids got a “junior scientist” certificate, lots of praise and an open play session with the dogs.

AD

AD

Crossman, who emphasizes that she is an animal lover, declined to reveal the findings before they’re published. But “hopefully” they will show that dogs can affect children’s stress, she said — before quickly offering a researcher’s clarification.

“I say ‘hopefully’ not just because I think it works or hope it does, but because these programs are used so widely,” she explained. “Kids are already participating in this on a huge scale. Ideally, the order goes the other way around: We test the idea, and then we implement.”

story_reviews_00208,"LONDON (Reuters) - British liquid biopsy company Angle said its Parsortix blood test had beaten current methods in identifying ovarian cancer, a breakthough that could help women receive the best possible outcome from surgery.

Headline results from a study of 400 patients in Europe and the United States showed the test to detect cancerous cells in the bloodstream correctly identified cancer in up to 95 percent of cases, the company said.

The test will enable women with ovarian cancer to be referred to gynaecological surgeons who specialize in the care of women with ovarian cancer, while patients with a benign tumor will not have to travel to specialist centers.

Angle founder and chief executive Andrew Newland said the study had demonstrated the ability to correctly detect cancer, and importantly correctly detect the absence of cancer.

The test was nearly twice as successful in eliminating false-positives than current tests, he said.

It also had the potential to identify targets on the tumor that could be used to inform treatment strategies, he said.

“The vision is that a woman who has been diagnosed with having an abnormal pelvic mass will have a simple blood test and from that we will deduce whether or not she has cancer and if she does which drug would be most suitable for her,” he said.

The performance of the test would now be validated in another study designed to meet European CE Mark and US FDA regulatory requirements, he said.

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, June 28, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Something as simple as taking a low-dose aspirin every day may protect pregnant women from the life-threatening condition known as preeclampsia, new research suggests.

""Preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications of pregnancy, with a high risk of death for the mother and baby,"" said senior study author Dr. Kypros Nicolaides. He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London.

But he added, ""This condition is, to a great extent, preventable.""

The new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams.

In those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk.

Preeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including:

A past history of preeclampsia,

Being pregnant with more than one baby,

Having longstanding high blood pressure,

Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems.

Dr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia.

ACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.

About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel.

Instead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia.

Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early.

Just 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed.

The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said.

There were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted.

However, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding.

Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta.

According to Kramer, ""This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby.""

Low-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted.

The study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia. The findings were also published simultaneously in a special online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

story_reviews_00211,"The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people suffer from clinical depression world-wide. But cost, time, stigma, distance to travel, language barriers and other factors prevent many from seeking help.

Now, a growing group of health-care providers are betting that technology—from web-based courses to mobile apps that send prompts via text—can help bridge that gap.

It might seem surprising, since therapy, more than many other kinds of medicine, is so focused on the relationship between patient and therapist. But research, including a meta-analysis of studies involving internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, suggests that digital therapies augmented by coaches who are available by text or phone can be as effective as evidence-based traditional therapy in treating some people with depression.

One study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and involving 99 patients with moderate depression, found that 90 of them completed a full eight-week course that included access to a suite of treatment apps and text support from coaches with at least a bachelor’s degree in psychology. On average, those who completed the course experienced a significant decrease in symptoms of depression, with three-fourths meeting the criteria for full remission. On average, participants used the apps more than 195 times over two months and interacted with a coach about twice a week.

Elsewhere, a study by the U.K. National Health Service, based on 1.2 million referrals for depression and anxiety, showed that computerized CBT administered to people with depression yielded a recovery rate of 58.4%, compared with 53.9% for those undergoing several types of in-person therapy. Ricardo F. Muñoz, a professor and founder of the Institute for International Internet Interventions for Health at Palo Alto University, who wasn’t involved in the research, says that while patients with more severe depression may be more likely to seek in-person therapy, “the fact that much mild or clinical depression can be successfully treated with computerized CBT is of note.”

Clinical psychologists put the first digital interventions for depression online about 15 years ago, according to Stephen Schueller, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a member of Northwestern’s Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies. “We basically thought, if it works in a self-help book, it will work online,” he says. But what they found was that it was difficult to motivate patients with depression to engage regularly with what were essentially online PowerPoint presentations.

Over the past five years, online therapies have evolved to include mobile apps such as Joyable, Lantern and Ginger.io, which are more personalized and responsive. They typically ask users to enter information about their moods and behaviors, then offer problem-solving suggestions, prompts to help patients retrain responses to negative situations, and daily health tips.

Dr. Schueller believes digital interventions need to continue evolving with technology to remain effective. “The future is trying to better understand how to make these apps and sites engaging,” he says. “That will include clinical psychologists working with experts in augmented reality, virtual reality and gaming to develop mobile solutions that are truly novel.”

One such tool might look like Koko, an online messaging chatbot that uses the internet community to address emotional distress. With Koko, a user puts in a negative thought, like ‘I’m stupid,’ and sends it out to other people who may be working through similar situations, Dr. Schueller says. “The crowd creates responses, which go through the system and come back to you as a new message: ‘Maybe you didn’t fail because you’re stupid, but maybe because you didn’t sleep enough or you didn’t study enough.’ ”

The idea is that the crowd “can provide many different ideas that, when combined, might produce better or more creative solutions” than a therapist can, says Dr. Schueller, adding that Koko also uses machine learning to identify those in need of more direct intervention or support.

Lynn Bufka, associate executive director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association, says research has demonstrated that individuals can benefit from a range of technology-enabled services. As such, she would like to see a more “stepped” approach to mental-health care for individual patients.

Jessica Caldwell uses the mobile therapy platform Talkspace to text and video chat with her (licensed) therapist. We sat in on one of their sessions to see how technology is transforming the practice. Photo/Video: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal.

Stepped care might start with a brief in-person assessment of a patient who shows signs of depression, so that therapists can identify any behavioral or health concerns, says Dr. Bufka, who believes that a human should always be involved at the beginning of a treatment process. “Then, depending on severity, we would provide each patient with a self-help book or access to web-based education. If that didn’t work, perhaps we’d move to a computer-assisted intervention, and then move toward in-person treatment,” either group or individual sessions, Dr. Bufka says. The stepped-care system exists in the U.K., she says, where providers in the National Health Service identify patients with moderate depression and other problems and offer self-help or technology-enabled services. “I think we’ll ultimately see a combination of different online interventions” for depression, she says.

Dr. Muñoz of Palo Alto University says he also believes that therapeutic and preventive services for depression could fall on a continuum.

The challenge for the public is knowing which digital tools to trust, he says, pointing to PsyberGuide, a website headed by Dr. Schueller that uses a standardized rating system to help consumers select products and apps for various mental-health conditions, as a good model.

Eventually, Dr. Muñoz envisions something he calls massive open online interventions, where therapeutic and preventive services could be delivered virtually to anyone in the world, in any language, at any time—ideally at no charge to users. The only barrier to entry would be internet access. Once the technology is built and more people use it, he says, the marginal cost of providing that intervention to one more person would gradually approach zero.

He points to a study he conducted in which 15,170 smokers from around the world participated in a free online smoking-cessation program offered in English and Spanish. After 12 months, 3,479 users, or 23%, reported they had quit smoking; to help that many people quit using more common care, he says, health providers would have had to give nicotine patches to 17,395 smokers, at a cost of $3.65 million.

His program, which had been built with earlier research grants, cost a total of $200,000 to maintain and advertise the website world-wide for 30 months.

“With the political will and across-the-board standards, we can give an intervention to anyone, even people who don’t have access to a mental-health clinic or antidepressants,” he says. “All they need is access to a smartphone with a data plan.”

story_reviews_00212,"WASHINGTON—An experimental drug is showing promise against an untreatable eye disease that blinds older adults — and intriguingly, it seems to work in patients who carry a particular gene flaw that fuels the damage to their vision.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called “dry” macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.

“These are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they’ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,” said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called “geographic atrophy.” When those cells die, they can’t grow back — the vision loss is irreversible.

What the research found

In an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What’s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped.

It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study’s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry — a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place.

Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that’s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested.

Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes?

One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.

Normally, there’s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne.

Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway’s natural brakes, so it can become too active.

The hypothesis: Genentech’s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“We try to reinsert the braking ability,” said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist.

What’s next?

Wednesday’s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year.

The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is “the first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,” said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“It’s a very, very exciting study,” said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association’s spokesman, who also wasn’t part of the research. “From the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.”

Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it’s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish.

Symptoms often aren’t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed.

Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it’s important for patients to know what type they have. While there’s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the “wet” form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina — and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.",New drug shows promise against vision-robbing disease in seniors,3,Associated Press
story_reviews_00213,"The prospect of resolving nagging knee pain – or discomfort that’s come on fairly sudden – drives many patients to go under the knife, specifically to have an arthroscopic knee procedure done.

During the procedure, an orthopedic surgeon inserts a tiny camera – or arthroscope – through a small incision to view the inside of the knee. The doctor then attempts to surgically address the knee pain, such as making repairs to a torn meniscus – a C-shaped disc that cushions the knee – or realigning a misaligned patella or kneecap.

“There are some limited circumstances where it’s helpful,” says Dr. Reed Siemieniuk, an internist in Toronto and a doctorate student in health research methodology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. That includes young patients who have sports injuries, or tears in the ligaments of the knee, he says, and patients who have bleeding in the knee – to try to figure out where the bleeding is coming from and address that. The surgery could also benefit individuals of any age who’ve suffered a traumatic injury to the knee, such as a meniscus tear. An example of a good candidate for arthroscopic knee surgery would be a 30-year-old who twists his knee getting up from a seated position or while playing tennis, says Dr. Joseph Bosco, a professor and vice chair of the department of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center.

But a meta-analysis led by Siemieniuk of research on arthroscopic knee surgery strongly recommended against knee scoping “in nearly all patients with degenerative knee disease.” The clinical practice guideline was published in the BMJ in May. The analysis evaluated arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease, which is often synonymous with knee arthritis. ""It is knee pain or locking that occurs with use or overuse. The most common risk factor is being overweight or obese,"" Siemieniuk explains. ""We use the term degenerative knee disease rather than arthritis because some surgeons restrict the diagnosis of arthritis to those diagnosed by X-ray or MRI when in reality, many people have degenerative knee disease with normal X-rays and MRIs."" Meniscus tears are also a common finding in those with arthritis, or degenerative knee disease, and are not associated with knee symptoms, but are often used as a reason to operate, he adds.

“In all of those groups of patients, arthroscopic surgery … doesn’t have any long-term benefit for pain or for function or quality of life,” Siemieniuk says. “But it does have some downsides [including] two to six weeks recovery time, and some rare but more serious adverse effects like blood clots that can sometimes be fatal [and] infection.”

The procedure is generally considered safe, but given the lack of evidence demonstrating a long-term benefit in these common scenarios, clinicians and patients should look at other non-surgical options to address knee pain, the researchers assert. The alternatives they cite include losing weight, if a person is overweight, physical therapy, corticoid steroid injections and other types of injections into the joint to treat pain or taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs. “Then if it’s severe and it really is interfering with your quality of life and it’s persistent … some people require knee replacement surgery,” Siemieniuk says. “But nowhere along that line should ... arthroscopic surgery, which is even more common, be performed.”

Bosco says he generally agrees with the recommendation set forth, and that it doesn’t change the way he practices. But he emphasizes that each patient has to be treated individually. The recommendation suggests similarly that individual factors and patient values and preferences must be taken into account. The expert panel that created the guidelines published in the BMJ included not only doctors but also several patients who had osteoarthritis, including one who’d had arthroscopic knee surgery.

“Our strong recommendation against arthroscopy reflects a low value on a modest probability (less than 15 percent) of small or very small improvement in short-term pain and function that does not persist to one year, and a higher value on avoiding the burden, postoperative limitations and rare serious adverse effects associated with knee arthroscopy,” the researchers wrote. The panel felt that almost all patients would share these values. “The recommendation is not applicable to patients who do not share these values (that is, those who place a high value on a small, uncertain and transient reduction in pain and function, and a low value on avoiding the burden and postoperative limitation associated with arthroscopy),” the researchers added.

But many arthroscopic surgeries are being done that don’t benefit patients, Siemieniuk stressed. In Ontario, approximately 90 percent of arthroscopic surgeries are performed for degenerative knee disease, he says. Though he adds that it’s difficult to know exactly what proportion of arthroscopic knee surgeries were for degenerative knee disease in the United States, the researchers reported that arthroscopic procedures for degenerative knee disease cost more than $3 billion per year in the U.S. alone, according to previous research. Citing other studies, they report that arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease is the most common orthopedic procedure in countries where data is available and that more than 2 million procedures are done annually worldwide.

Despite the concern that many arthroscopic surgeries are being performed on patients who won’t benefit, some clinicians say these type of guidelines have already been adopted by many surgeons.

The new recommendation comes as no surprise, says Dr. Alejandro Gonzalez Della Valle, a hip and knee surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. “For a number of years, we have known, that if we offer arthroscopic surgery to patients who have moderate or severe arthritis, they generally don’t do well in the long-term,” he says.

Frequently patients with lots of arthritis in the knee also have torn meniscus. But performing arthroscopic surgery won’t relieve a patient of the discomfort from the underlying arthritis. “Fixing the torn meniscus will not cure the patient’s pain,” he says. “Under those conditions, the surgery will not be useful or effective or will not provide any benefit to the patient.”

On the other hand, some patients have very minimal arthritis in the knee, and a very severe meniscal tear producing a lot of pain. “In our clinical impression, those patients can do well for several years with arthroscopic surgery,” he says. “So it’s all about patient selection at the end of the day.” For ideal arthroscopic candidates – like those who suffer a traumatic or sports-related meniscal tear, who have no arthritis – arthroscopic surgery can provide a permanent fix.",The Case Against – and for – Arthroscopic Knee Surgery,4,U.S. News & World Report
story_reviews_00214,"NEW YORK -- A new study says yoga may be as good a treatment for back pain as physical therapy.

One person who might agree is 74-year-old Judith Zaborowski, who took up yoga more than 10 years ago to help with her aching back.

""I'm much more comfortable with movement,"" she told CBS News. ""Yoga makes me think about my back and how I'm standing and if I'm standing properly, then I can function better.""

In the study, 320 adults with moderate to severe back pain received one of three approaches over 12 weeks:

Weekly yoga classes



15 physical therapy visits



Education about how to cope with back pain



CBS News

Yoga was just as effective as physical therapy -- and both groups were about 20 percent less likely to use pain medication than patients receiving education alone.

Yoga classes started with relaxation exercises, warm up, then gentle yoga poses like wall dog and chair twist.

Dr. Robert Saper CBS News

Dr. Robert Saper at Boston Medical Center is one of the authors. He explained the results.

""Yoga was as effective as physical therapy for reducing pain intensity,"" Saper said. ""Perhaps most importantly reducing pain medication use.""

Saper says yoga likely works by strengthening core and lower back muscles and helping with mind-body relaxation.

""I feel, the more that one can do for one's self and not depend on medication, the healthier it is for your body,"" Zaborowski said.

MONDAY, June 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative to pain medications for some emergency room patients, a new study reports.

""While acupuncture is widely used by practitioners in community settings for treating pain, it is rarely used in hospital emergency departments,"" said study lead investigator Marc Cohen. He is a professor in the School of Health and Biomedical Sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.

The study -- billed as the world's largest randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture in the emergency department -- included 528 patients.

The study participants were seen at four Australian emergency departments for acute low back pain, migraines or ankle sprains. Patients who said their level of pain was at least 4 on a 10-point scale received one of three treatments: acupuncture alone; acupuncture with painkillers; or painkillers alone.

One hour after treatment, less than 40 percent of all patients had significant pain reduction, meaning at least a 2-point decline on the 10-point scale. More than 80 percent still had a pain rating of at least 4, the findings showed.

But two days later, most patients were satisfied. Overall, nearly 83 percent of acupuncture-only patients said they would probably or definitely repeat their treatment, compared with about 81 percent in the combined group, and 78 percent who took painkillers alone.

""Emergency nurses and doctors need a variety of pain-relieving options when treating patients, given the concerns around opioids such as morphine, which carry the risk of addiction when used long-term,"" Cohen said in a university news release.

The study results suggest acupuncture would be especially beneficial for patients who can't use standard pain-relieving drugs because of other medical conditions, Cohen added.

But he noted that more research is needed because some patients remained in pain no matter what treatment they received.

The study was published June 18 in the Medical Journal of Australia.

story_reviews_00216,"Scientists have developed a simple three-in-one blood test they believe could transform treatment of advanced prostate cancer, helping to extend or save lives.

The test, developed by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London and the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, picks out men suitable for treatment with olaparib, part of a revolutionary class of drugs called “PARP-inhibitors”, which stops damaged cells from repairing themselves.

The liquid biopsy, less invasive than a tissue biopsy, also detects early signs of resistance to olaparib and monitors the cancer’s evolution over time, according to the paper, published in Cancer Discovery on Monday.

Prof Johann de Bono, Regius professor of cancer research at the ICR, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, said: “Our study identifies, for the first time, genetic changes that allow prostate cancer cells to become resistant to the precision medicine olaparib.

“From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term. We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP-inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy.

“Not only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer as well.”

By testing cancer DNA in the bloodstream, the researchers found they could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer were likely to benefit from treatment with the drug.



They also used the test to analyse DNA in the blood after treatment had started, so people who were not responding could be identified and switched to alternative therapy in as little as four to eight weeks.

Thirdly, they used the test to monitor a patient’s blood throughout treatment to quickly pick up signs that the cancer was evolving genetically and might be becoming resistant to the drugs.

The researchers collected blood samples from 49 men at the Royal Marsden with advanced prostate cancer enrolled in the phase II clinical trial of olaparib.



The drug is effective at killing cancer cells that have errors in genes which would otherwise keep them healthy. Some patients respond to olaparib for years but in others the treatment can fail early or the cancer can evolve resistance.

The ICR chief executive, Prof Paul Workman, said the test could “usher in a new era of precision medicine for prostate cancer”.

He said: “Blood tests for cancer promise to be truly revolutionary. They are cheap and simple to use, but most importantly, because they aren’t invasive, they can be employed or applied to routinely monitor patients to spot early if treatment is failing – offering patients the best chance of surviving their disease.”

story_reviews_00219,"George Burke has a talent for tossing back his daily cocktail — which contains vitamins, minerals, muscle-building compounds, some little-known research drugs and a microdose of LSD — in almost a single gulp. It’s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.

Burke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California’s Silicon Valley, where he’s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.

He used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn’t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics — some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers — said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.

“It’s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,” Burke acknowledges. “It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”

The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.

But when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.

Piracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it’s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.

Using ‘stacks’

A number of companies now market nootropic “stacks,” or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.

Because they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.

When Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. “It was as if I was buying coke off the street,” he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.

But self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.

“Who doesn’t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn’t want to maximize their muscle mass?” asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.

But while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs — of any type — improve thinking or productivity over the long run. “There’s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,” notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, “it’s a zero-sum game. That’s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you’re probably impairing another system.”

Short-term benefits?

Early studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics — so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.

A 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer’s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.

Although piracetam has a history of “relatively few side effects,” it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “We don’t use it at all and never have.”

As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. “Piracetam has been studied for decades,” says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But “some of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they’re selling. Please don’t take it, people!”

For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.

Burke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee — a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil — has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance “to teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.”

Last spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD — which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity — was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a “party dose” — enough to give you “the glow” and enhance your cognitive powers without “the trip.”

Burke says he definitely got the glow. “The first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.”

The effects of fasting

Not all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.

Nootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.

“We stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,” says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company’s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms — not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.

“Fasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,” Lam enthuses. “It’s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.”

Nootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.

Research on animals has shown that intermittent fasting — limiting caloric intake at least two days a week — can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.

Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence — so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.

“There’s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,” he says.

Fasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, “I fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.” The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.

Far easier to take a pill.

Looking for an edge

Vinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city’s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.

Ngo has experimented with piracetam himself (“The first time I tried it, I thought, ‘Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.’ I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It’s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain”).

But he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.

“There is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,” Ngo says. “People want to find an edge over their competitor — that’s how they got their position in the first place. I’m trying to give them a little more wiggle room — but in a safe way.”

He says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. “I don’t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate” for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.

If, for example, someone decides to go on medication — be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam — the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.

“I want to empower them,” Ngo says, but “there’s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.”

story_reviews_00220,"Wagler's pit viper

THURSDAY, June 8, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scary pit vipers may need an image upgrade: Their venom might end up helping human heart patients, research suggests.

Taiwanese scientists say a blood thinner drug based on venom from the Wagler's pit viper was effective in mice, and might prove safer than current anti-clotting meds for humans one day.

The serpent-medicine connection isn't new, one cardiologist noted, since venom typically kills by disrupting the blood's clotting mechanisms.

""Blood thinner medications have a long and storied history with snake venom,"" said Dr Satjit Bhysri, a heart specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. In fact, ""many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom,"" he added.

In the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler's pit viper or the Temple viper.

The snake's venom contains a protein called trowaglerix, the researchers explained. Designing a molecule based on trowaglerix, Huang's group was able to block GPVI -- a protein that sits on the surface of blood platelet cells and is crucial to allowing these cells to clump together and form clots.

When mixed with blood, the new compound prevented blood cells called platelets from clotting. Also, mice that received the drug had slower blood clot formation than untreated mice, but the treated mice did not bleed longer than untreated mice. Still, experiments in animals often don't translate to success in humans, so further research is needed.

Dr. Kevin Marzo is head of cardiology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. Reviewing the findings, he agreed that the drug under development may have merit.

""Many of the lifesaving drugs used in the treatment of heart attack patients work by inhibiting platelets and preventing blood clotting. However, it is often at the cost of serious bleeding complications,"" he said.

""The potential development of a new agent based on snake venom that could have similar beneficial effects on preventing blood clotting, and potentially cause less bleeding side effects, is an exciting discovery that warrants future investigation,"" Marzo added.

The study was published June 8 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.

story_reviews_00221,"A vaccine that blocks the high from heroin has just moved one step closer to reality.

The compound, created by chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, works in a way that’s similar to other vaccines. By introducing the immune system to a potential future enemy, antibodies against that invader are ready to attack when the time comes. In this case, the vaccine introduces a piece of the heroin molecule to the immune system. In response, this protective system manufactures antibodies to the drug, including the components that cause the high.

As a result, those molecules never reach the brain, preventing the euphoria that may have otherwise resulted. The absence of a high could help recovering heroin users resist the temptation to relapse, the researchers say.

The current study of the vaccine, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, follows eight years of laboratory research and studies in rodents that indicated the compound could neutralize heroin at different doses.

Here, the Scripps investigators, working with researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, tested the vaccine on four rhesus monkeys. The animals were given three doses of the vaccine, which elicited a successful immune response that neutralized heroin given at varying doses. The high-blocking effects of the vaccine were strongest during the first month but continued for more than eight months. The researchers did not observe any harmful side effects from the intervention.

Two of the animals had been exposed to the vaccine seven months before for a similar pilot study. All four monkeys responded to the vaccine, but the two that were receiving it a second time had a stronger response, hinting that their immune systems were already primed with the “memory” of the compound.

Mark Thomas, who researches addiction at the University of Minnesota Health Sciences, says that a vaccine like this could help a former heroin abuser, “forge a path to abstinence.” Thomas, who was not involved with the study, explains that he was initially wary of the vaccine approach. He figured that a person who is dependent on drugs would find a replacement if heroin no longer caused a high.

“It’s not going to be a panacea,” says Thomas. But in light of the growing drug abuse epidemic, for which, he says, “we have so few tools,” adding a vaccine to the available treatments could help. “It’s an avenue that shows some promise.”

Although research on humans is not yet planned, study authors Kim Janda and Paul Bremer, chemists at the Scripps Research Institute, are encouraged about this next step. Other anti-heroin vaccines have proved ineffective for people, but this compound is the first to work in primates. “We believe this vaccine candidate will prove safe for human trials,” said Janda in a statement.

Importantly, this vaccine is designed to work against only heroin, not other opioids. Bremer and Janda now hope to find a company interested in conducting a human study so that the vaccine can become commercially available.

story_reviews_00222,"A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn’t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.

Dr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.

Those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

Reginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.

He stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can’t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.

European regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.

In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.

“I tell my patients, ‘buyer beware,’” Shepard said in an email. “I tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.”

If chondroitin doesn’t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID “periodically,” and to be aware of the side effects.

“If you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,” Shepard cautioned.

Dr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is “reasonable to try” for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.

“However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,” said Wolfe, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.

story_reviews_00223,"It’s common for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to also struggle with depression. Now, a small study published in the journal Gastroenterology suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.

The randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.

For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)

After six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.

Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.

One explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.

MORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?

“We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. “It provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.”

No serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that bifidobacteria seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, lactobacilli.

Some experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.

MORE: Should I Eat Olives?

The study’s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn’t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn’t commercially available, anyway.) “The evidence at this point is promising,” says McIntyre, “but it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy.”

But McIntyre says the results are encouraging. “They seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,” he says.

story_reviews_00226,"With little fanfare, the Food and Drug Administration did something this week that it’s never done before: The agency approved a single prescription drug, pembrolizumab (marketed by Merck as Keytruda) for treatment of solid tumors in any organ so long as the malignancy bears a specific genetic signature.

In the fast-moving field of cancer treatment, the FDA’s announcement marks an important milestone, close to two decades in the making. Increasingly, cancer will no longer be identified, categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits, or in which it first gained its foothold. In a shift that is already underway, cancers will be known by — and treated for — the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them.

In clinical trial evidence cited by the FDA this week, pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40% of patients with one of 15 end-stage malignancies. And for 78% of those patients, that response lasted six months or more. A trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients, pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer, and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug.

All of those subjects, of course, had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target.

Advertisement

In the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments, that record of success constitutes a “home run,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University’s Kimmel Cancer Center. Vogelstein’s 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab’s broad cancer-fighting powers.

With the FDA’s announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer. No longer will they see all cancers of the lung, breast, colon, brain, liver, pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another. Instead, they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they’re found. And they’ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon, either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack.

It’s a key principle of what’s called “precision medicine” — the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor’s specific molecular fingerprint, and not, as most chemotherapies do, harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones.

In the cancers pembrolizumab treats, the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern DNA repair. Deficiencies in the DNA’s “mismatch repair system” generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets. The mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and the FDA had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week.

But this week’s FDA approval goes further: It makes clear that the drug’s molecular targets are also common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and less frequently present in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid gland.

All told, scientists believe about 4% of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by Keytruda.

The appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape — not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well.

Organizations representing, say, people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients. In cancer centers, specialists in, say, melanoma will start (in fact, have already started) treating patients with a range of other cancers. When drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug, they’ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they’ve used in the past: the genetic signatures their tumors bear.

Even before the FDA’s announcement this week, all these processes were underway. The FDA’s decision recognizes that fact, said Dr. Svetomir Markovic, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in treating melanoma.

But the decision also puts cancer physicians — as well as insurers, who will be called on to pay Keytruda’s $100,000-per-year price tag — on notice that a new era is at hand, said Markovic.

“The field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed,” he said. Physicians “are having a hard time keeping up, and I can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same,” he added. “But this decision by the FDA is really wonderful: It has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help.”

Two other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment — nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) — but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum. Several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials, and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be.

“In many ways we’re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy: There’s clear benefit but it’s still a minority of patients that get long-term benefit,” said Markovic of the Mayo Institute. “We will get better at this.”

Markovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab, as well as the FDA’s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions, could prompt drug companies, physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs. With a clearer idea of which patients they might help, and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials, some failures may look more promising, he said.

“We just needed to take the first step in showing that this long-believed theory — that the immune system can kill cancer — is true,” Markovic added. “It indeed can.”

story_reviews_00227,"(CNN) Cannabidiol, which is found in marijuana plants, reduced the number of convulsive seizures in children with a severe and often fatal epilepsy disorder, according to research published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . Among children taking cannabidiol, the decrease in the frequency of convulsive seizures -- which involve a loss of consciousness, stiffened muscles and jerking movements -- was 23 percentage points greater than the decrease in seizures among children taking a placebo.

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial, which is considered the gold standard test for any new medicine.

GW Pharmaceuticals, a company that is developing cannabidiol medicines, helped subsidize the study.

""After 3,800 years of cannabis use for epilepsy ... we finally have solid evidence,"" said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, lead author of the study and director of NYU Langone's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. His own previous research indicates that cannabis was used as early as 1800 B.C. in Sumeria to treat epilepsy; neurologists of the Victorian period used Indian hemp, which is rich in cannabidiol, for the same purpose.

Despite the generally positive results, most study participants reported side effects that included vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and some liver issues.

""CBD is an effective drug for this type of rare epilepsy but was not a panacea (or cure-all) for these children,"" Devinsky said.

What is Dravet syndrome?

A total of 120 patients with Dravet syndrome, ranging in age from nearly 2 to 18 years old, were randomly assigned to receive either an oral solution of cannabidiol or a placebo for a 14-week period.

""Dravet syndrome is a severe childhood-onset epilepsy that causes multiple kinds of seizures, developmental delays, speech and language problems, behavioral issues and movement and balance problems,"" said Brandy Fureman, vice president of research and new therapies at the Epilepsy Foundation. She was not involved in the new study.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that disrupts electrical communication between neurons in the brain. Considered a spectrum disorder, different epilepsy syndromes are defined by clusters of symptoms or features and treated accordingly.

Existing epilepsy medications usually don't work for patients with Dravet, so ""up to 20% of these children die from seizures before age 20 years,"" Devinsky explained.

Within the study, individual participants experienced convulsive seizures at a rate ranging from four per month, on average, to 1,717 per month.

During the 14-week study, frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from an average of 12.4 to 5.9 per month in the cannabidiol group, compared with 14.9 to 14.1 in the placebo group. On average, the change in seizure frequency amounted to a 39% decrease for the cannabidiol group patients, compared with a roughly 13% decrease among the placebo group.

Five percent of the children became entirely seizure-free during the 14-week study. Overall, parents in the cannabidiol group felt that they witnessed ""significantly greater"" positive changes in their children than parents in the placebo group.

However, there was a downside. Most (93%) of the cannabidiol patients reported side effects, though three-quarters of the placebo group patients did as well. Nine out of 61 cannabidiol group patients dropped out of the study, eight of them because of side effects, compared with just three of the 59 placebo group patients.

""Tiredness (somnolence or fatigue) was most common; others were decreased appetite, diarrhea and vomiting,"" Devinsky explained.

Based on the overall results, Devinsky believes CBD should be evaluated for epilepsy types beyond Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a genetic mutation and affects about one in 20,000 to 40,000 children in the United States.

Wayne Hall, professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland in Australia, also believes the findings are ""sufficiently encouraging"" to warrant further research of cannabidiol that focuses on ""related forms of epilepsy.""

'Critically important' for the epilepsy community

""No one study decides an issue; the sample size is still relatively small (because this is a rare syndrome and so hard to study large numbers of cases) and the duration of treatment so far has been relatively short,"" Hall, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email.

Still, Hall said the research, which carefully measured safety and efficacy for a ""substantial"" number of children, showed ""clear evidence of benefits in reducing seizure frequency and severity over the duration of the trial.""

""glad to see"" data coming out. Porter is not one of the researchers behind this study, though she too has published papers on cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy. Dr. Brenda Porter, associate professor of neurology at Stanford School of Medicine, said she's""glad to see"" data coming out. Porter is not one of the researchers behind this study, though she too has published papers on cannabidiol as a treatment for epilepsy.

""Interestingly, it looks similar to our other seizure medications in terms of efficacy and tolerability,"" Porter said. ""So, sadly, not a home run for most patients but another tool in our treatment regimen.""

The marijuana plant is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Scientific researchers studying cannabidiol must meet federal security requirements and follow federal practices. Some scientists have said these federal requirements have slowed research supporting medicinal benefits of the plant.

Porter believes the study may open the door to having ""more thoughtful discussions with our patients about the efficacy and the side effects"" of cannabidiol. ""Hopefully, the FDA will see this as a sign it should be moved off of Schedule I. If it stays on Schedule I, we will have trouble getting it to our patients when it does become available.""

The 1970 Controlled Substances Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug , meaning it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.""

Changing the schedule of a drug falls to the Drug Enforcement Administration or the Department of Health and Human Services. An interested party, such as a drug company, may also petition for the process to begin. The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Drug Abuse provide guidance to the DEA when reviewing scientific evidence on which to base a schedule change.

Dr. David Gloss, director of clinical neurophysiology at CAMC Health System in Charleston, West Virginia, believes the new study is ""very important"" because ""there's a lot of people using cannabidiol for all kinds of stuff."" Gloss co-authored a review of cannabinoids for the Cochrane Library , which publishes systematic reviews of medical research. He was not involved in the new research.

He noted that generating more evidence of effective use is ""a good thing.""

Already, there is existing "" medical evidence of efficacy for narrow neurologic conditions,"" said Gloss, who hopes that when enough evidence is available, the classification of cannabidiol as a Schedule I drug might be reconsidered and changed.

The University of Queensland's Hall believes that boundaries between medical use of cannabinoids and the recreational use of cannabis by adults should not be blurred. ""If future clinical trials confirm these promising results, then appropriate regulation will enable the drug to be safely used for medical purposes,"" he said.

The Epilepsy Foundation's Fureman said, ""before publication of this trial, much of the clinical evidence about CBD's effects on people's seizures was uncontrolled and anecdotal."" She added that the new study is ""critically important"" for the epilepsy community, which believes a CBD-based medical product would be a first-in-class therapeutic option.

On the need for more scientific research, all these experts agree.

story_reviews_00228,"A treatment for obesity could be on the horizon as scientists have discovered an antibody that reduces body fat.

In trials on mice, the antibody was found to increase bone mass and reduce adipose tissue (fat)—and while human studies are some way off, the findings could lead to new treatments for weight loss and osteoporosis.

The antibody discovered targets follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) found in the pituitary gland. Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.

From this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice—and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women—a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.

But scientists also realized it could have other uses. Mone Zaidi, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, is one of the authors on the latest study into how the antibody triggers weight loss. “Osteoporosis and obesity are fairly closely linked in several ways,” he tells Newsweek. “Women, when they undergo menopause, lose bone and gain body fat. So we thought maybe there was a connection—that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.”

In the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.

Zaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. “In all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It’s a fairly dramatic effect.” Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).

But how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.

Their next step is to “humanize” the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. “We would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead—if all goes well—to the first human trials in three to four years.”

At present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: “I think obesity is a more prevalent disease—but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,” Zaidi says.

Eventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. “That’s the ideal situation,” he says. “It could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger. And the population that could be most benefited by this could be post-menopausal women.”

Commenting on the research, Tim Speckor, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, U.K., says: “It’s a nice mouse study that seems to work—whether it works in humans is another matter.”",Obesity Cure? Scientists Discover Antibody That Reduces Body Fat in Mice,2,Newsweek
story_reviews_00229,"Common blood tests could help diagnose cancer early even in patients that show no other symptoms, study finds

A common blood test could help diagnose cancer earlier, according to research suggesting a high platelet count is strongly associated with the disease.



Platelets are tiny blood cells that circulate in the body, helping wounds to clot. But in some individuals too many platelets are produced – a condition known as thrombocytosis, thought to affect about half a million people in the UK over the age of 40.

Researchers say that raised platelet counts are as good a predictor of getting any cancer as a lump in the breast is for breast cancer.

“This is a clue which can be used in practice by GPs to help them select patients for further investigation … most excitingly in some patients who may not already have other symptoms of cancer to achieve earlier diagnosis,” said Sarah Bailey, co-author of the research from the University of Exeter.

Previous studies have suggested a link between thrombocytosis and various cancers, with recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advising high platelet counts could be a sign of cancer of the oesophageal, stomach, lung or uterus.

But it remained unclear whether the condition could signal an increased risk of all cancers, and how it ties in with factors such as age and sex.

Can you manufacture blood cells? Read more

Writing in the British Journal of General Practice, Bailey and colleagues report how they examined data from almost 50,000 individuals aged 40 or over who had been given a blood test by their GP. The patients were selected at random from a national database.

In total, over 31,000 patients found to have a raised platelet count, and nearly 8,000 without, were included in the analysis.

Within a year of the blood test, the team found that cancer was more common among those who had thrombocytosis: 11.6% of men and 6.2% of women were found to have cancer compared to 4.1% of men and 2.2% of women without a raised platelet count. In the general population about 1% of individuals over the age of 40 develop cancer each year.

For comparison, among women aged between 50 and 59 who have discovered a breast lump, the proportion who are found to have breast cancer is 8.5%.



“We found cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men with raised platelet counts than it was in women with raised platelet counts and we believe that is because there are more causes of raised platelet counts in women that are not cancer,” said Bailey.

The team add that cancer was more common among for those who had thrombocytosis for longer. Of the men who had a raised platelet count of the same value or higher six months after being diagnosed with thrombocytosis, 18.1% developed cancer, while for women the figure was 10.1%.

While many different types of cancer were present in both groups, the team found that breast and prostate cancers were less common among those with thrombocytosis than in the general population, while lung and colorectal cancers were more common.

For about a third of cases of lung and colorectal cancer in patients with thrombocytosis, there had been no other symptoms that raised the suggestion of cancer. That, say the researchers, makes testing for raised platelet count a valuable tool, and could speed up cancer diagnosis by at least three months for thousands of patients a year.

Richard Neal, professor of primary care oncology at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study.

“This is an excellent study that demonstrates the potential for a commonly used blood test to identify some patients with cancer earlier,” he said.

“This work should begin to change practice, so that GPs should be testing patients with raised platelet counts for cancer, especially those without other potential cancer symptoms,” he added.

Dr Jasmine Just, Cancer Research UK’s health information officer, said more research was need to confirm whether further tests following a high platelet count would save lives.

“There are lots of possible reasons a person’s platelet count might be high, and in most cases it won’t be down to cancer,” she added.

“Measuring platelet count in patients who don’t otherwise warrant a blood test is not necessarily a good idea. But if a patient has a blood test for another reason and a high platelet count is found, then one of the possible diagnoses doctors should consider is cancer.”",High blood platelet count 'as good a cancer predictor as a lump in the breast',4,The Guardian

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, May 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A leukemia drug might also effectively treat severe asthma, a small-scale clinical trial suggests.

Gleevec (imatinib) reduced the ""twitchiness"" of airways, making them less likely to reflexively constrict when exposed to an allergen or asthma trigger, said senior researcher Dr. Elliot Israel.

""We showed we could decrease the amount of airway twitchiness by a third,"" Israel said. ""That's a substantial change, and that was significant compared with the placebo group.""

Israel is director of the respiratory therapy department at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

The drug also improved overall airway function, an effect researchers hadn't expected, Israel said.

People whose severe asthma isn't controlled despite use of high-dose steroid medications are at risk of declining lung function and poor quality of life, the researchers said in background notes.

But, this powerful cancer drug can't be recommended for them on the basis of this small study, Israel and other specialists noted.

Gleevec fights leukemia by blocking a specific receptor on cancerous white blood cells, inhibiting their ability to multiply and spread, Israel said.

That same action also affects mast cells, a type of white blood cell distributed throughout the body that promotes inflammation and causes allergic reactions, Israel said.

For example, mast cells in the skin are responsible for hives, while mast cells in the lungs have been associated with severe asthma, he said.

""By blocking the signal that helps keep mast cells alive, we were hoping to reduce the number of these cells,"" Israel said. ""By doing that, we hoped to produce improvements beyond the maximal therapy that these patients with severe asthma are on.""

Israel and his colleagues recruited 62 severe asthma sufferers for the study. All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.

Blood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.

Further, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.

Physical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.

""There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,"" Israel said.

Side-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. One person dropped out because of a sharp decline in white blood cells, which bounced back after the drug was discontinued. Another person dropped out because of leg cramps associated with the drug.

""All in all, we were expecting a significantly greater pattern of side-effects, and we didn't see it,"" Israel explained.

According to Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, ""This drug represents a new mechanism for the immune modulation of severe asthma."" Horovitz was not involved with the study.

""It has been a while since a new approach and treatment for severe asthma has emerged,"" Horovitz said. ""Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma.""

Pulmonologist Dr. Theodore Maniatis is medical director of Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He sounded a more cautionary note.

""This is a very early work that in no way should encourage asthmatics,"" Maniatis said. ""While it is a very interesting study for pulmonologists and immunologists, it is a very small study.""

Until now, ""this immune-modulating drug has been used only for cancer and is toxic,"" he added. ""It will take years of study to determine the usefulness of this drug in treatment.""

Israel agreed that further clinical trials are needed. ""Before you go out and recommend this be used in general, you really want to repeat this in a larger population with greater numbers,"" he said.

It likely will be three to four years before Gleevec could be approved for asthma treatment, Israel estimated.

If proven effective, Gleevec might provide a relatively inexpensive new treatment for asthma patients. Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.

story_reviews_00231,"(Reuters) - Pivotal trial results for Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda show that it lengthened survival by three months, or nearly 40 percent, for patients with advanced bladder cancer who had stopped responding to chemotherapy.

The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial.

The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. Roche, in an emailed statement, said it plans to discuss the data with health authorities but did not disclose the timing for the discussions. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency.

Merck filed in February for FDA approval of Keytruda for both initial and secondary treatment of advanced urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.

Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.

In addition to Tecentriq’s approval for bladder cancer patients whose disease has stopped responding to chemotherapy, the FDA last month approved the Roche drug as an initial treatment for people with a specific type of advanced bladder cancer and in people whose cancer progressed despite at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.

The agency has also granted contingent approval to AstraZeneca Plc’s Imfinzi, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Bavencio, developed by Pfizer Inc and Merck KGaA, as second-line bladder cancer treatments.

All five drugs are part of a new class of treatments designed to unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer by interfering with proteins known as PD-1 or PD-L1 that help malignant cells evade immune attack.

Merck said data from an open-label Phase 3 trial of 542 advanced bladder cancer patients showed median survival of 10.3 months for Keytruda patients and 7.4 months for patients given second-line chemotherapy. The study’s median follow-up was 18.5 months.

After 18 months, 36 percent of Keytruda patients were alive, compared with 20.5 percent of chemotherapy patients, according to research published by ASCO.

The study did not detect a difference in the length of time patients lived without their disease getting worse.

Millions of people take a low-dose aspirin daily in hopes of reducing their chances of having a heart attack. For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?

This study

The researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.

Over seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.

[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]

Who may be affected?

Women. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.

Caveats

The researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results. Data on aspirin and other NSAID usage came from the women’s responses on questionnaires. Most of the participants were white.

FRIDAY, May 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Blood thinners are often prescribed to prevent strokes in people with the abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.

The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners.

""We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.

Atrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.

Atrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained.

While many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.

Although the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.

In patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.

A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.

In this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.

In patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.

The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.

For the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.

""Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,"" Bunch said. ""The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,"" he added.

The results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

According to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), ""There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia."" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.

""Therefore,"" he said, ""we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline,"" Lee said.

SAN FRANCISCO — Tech company developer conferences always feature a wacky demo or three.

But at Build 2017 in Seattle Wednesday, Microsoft went for the waterworks at the conclusion of CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address: it showcased a prototype watch that temporarily eliminated the arm shaking that often plagues those suffering from the neurological disease Parkinson's.

After a speech that both heralded and warned about coming leaps in technological power, Nadella screened a video that told the story of two British Microsoft Research employees, Haiyan Zhang and Nicolas Villa, who developed the tremor-interrupting device for a BBC documentary, The Big Life Fix.

Working with graphic designer and Parkinson's sufferer Emma Lawton, 32, the researchers developed a watch — which they named Emma — that, according to Microsoft, ""vibrates in a distinctive pattern to disrupt the feedback loop between brain and hand.""

The video showed Lawton trying to draw a square with her shaky right hand, and then again, wearing Emma. Watson erupts in tears as she calls her mother to say this is the first time she's been able to write her name in ages.

When the lights went up, Nadella welcomed both Lawton and engineer Zhang on stage, thanking them for showing that thanks ""developers can have impact.""

Emma Watch remains a prototype, Microsoft says, but the developers are working with a neuroscience research team to undertake trials with a small group of Parkinson's sufferers.

The watch works through a combination of sensors and AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to potentially detect and monitor symptoms like tremors, stiffness and instability, among others, according to Microsoft. ""Once these symptoms can be identified and measured, it’s possible to develop technology and devices that help humans manage their symptoms. AI is used to classify the sensor information and elicit real-time responses on small devices like wearables.""

Microsoft stresses that Emma Watch is not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 10 million people. ""Rather, its technology has the potential to help Parkinson’s patients manage symptoms that impede regular functions. The goal of further research is to determine whether Emma Watch could help other people with similar Parkinson’s symptoms.""

story_reviews_00237,"(Reuters Health) - The experimental orphan drug teprotumumab significantly reduces the eye bulging associated with Graves’ disease, according to results of a small trial.

Among the 88 participants with moderate-to-severe disease who were given intravenous infusions of either teprotumumab or a dummy drug every three weeks for eight treatments, 43 percent who got the real drug had a reduction of at least 2 millimeters in eye protrusion by the sixth week compared to 4 percent in the placebo group.

“In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.

The eyes don’t have that bulging appearance, he said, and many of them return to the degree of bulging they had before they got the disease.

“That’s something that we almost never see in someone who’s manifested the degree of disease one needed to have in order to get into the study,” Smith said.

The marked reduction in bulging is similar to that reported after decompression surgery, Smith and his colleagues write in the New England Journal of medicine.

Graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid in the United States, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.

Certain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves’ eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves’ disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.

Teprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves’ patients with moderate to severe bulge.

The study “included some of the worst cases imaginable and we’re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,” Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

By week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.

More people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.

However, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.

High blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.

The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.

The drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche. River Vision Development Corporation licensed the drug from Roche. On Monday, Horizon Pharma announced that it was acquiring River Vision, which paid for the new study.

Smith said FDA approval could come sometime in 2018. Enrollment in a follow-up trial is expected to begin within six weeks.

The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.

The researchers also cautioned that the study only included volunteers with active disease of recent onset so “the potential of teprotumumab in benefiting patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed.”

story_reviews_00238,"Marijuana appears to improve the memory and learning abilities of old mice. Scientists discovered low doses of its main psychoactive ingredient—cannabinoid THC—can reverse the age-related decline in cognitive abilities, a finding that could lead to scientists figuring out a way of slowing brain aging in humans.

Researchers are increasingly examining THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) for its potential medical benefits. In the U.K., Oxford University recently launched a £10 million ($13 million) program to “identify new medical therapies through research into the molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms of cannabinoids.” Meanwhile, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now approved several medications derived from THC.

Many scientists are currently looking at its potential use as a treatment for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.

Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week

In a study published in Nature Medicine on Monday, researchers led by Andreas Zimmer, from the University of Bonn, Germany, have shown how THC can provide significant benefits to mice when it comes to age-related cognitive decline.

THC interacts with receptors in the brain’s endocannabinoid system, which is involved in many physiological functions, including pain, mood, memory and appetite. Previous research has also shown activity in the endocannabinoid system declines as we get older, indicating it plays a role in the progression of aging.

To study what effect THC has on the aging brain, scientists gave low doses of THC to mice at three different life stages—two months, 12 months and 18 months. The latter two groups represented mature and old age.

The team carried out three experiments. The first involved a water maze, where mice have to learn and then remember how to navigate their way to the end. In a control group, mature and old mice performed worse than the young group. However, when treated with THC, the older groups improved at the task, while the young mice fared far worse. (The study’s authors noted that this was in “good agreement with the known detrimental effects of THC on cognition in young animals and humans.”

Next, they created a task where mice had to locate a specific object. Older mice treated with THC performed to the same standard as young mice that had not been given the drug. A third test relating to partner recognition also showed THC led to improved memory in mature and older mice. “Together, these results reveal a profound, long-lasting improvement of cognitive performance resulting from a low dose of THC treatment in mature and old animals,” the scientists write.

John Vizcaino/Reuters

Further research showed what might cause the improvement, with THC appearing to restore hippocampal gene transcription patterns—activity in the brain relating to memory and learning—to a similar state seen in young mice.

The team argues that while they do not yet know if these findings would be same in humans, it could lead to new treatments to prevent cognitive decline in older people: “Cannabis preparations and THC are used for medicinal purposes,” they write. “They have an excellent safety record and do not produce adverse side-effects when administered at a low dose to older individuals. Thus, chronic, low-dose treatment with THC or cannabis extracts could be a potential strategy to slow down or even to reverse cognitive decline in the elderly.”

Zameel Cader, associate professor in clinical neurosciences at Oxford University, is involved in the institution’s $13 million cannabis research project. Commenting on the Nature Medicine study, he tells Newsweek the paper is “very interesting on a number of levels.”

“First of all there’s clearly growing interest in the potential therapeutic role of cannabinoids and in this particular case THC on various human conditions,” he says. “This paper is addressing a possible role for that compound in memory and cognition, which is relevant to disorders such as Alzheimer’s and other dementias.”

He said that while it is important to remember the study was carried out on mouse models, the differences in the effect of the drug on younger animals versus older animals tells us a lot about our understanding of the differences between old and young brains.

Moving this research forward, however, will be problematic: “Testing in humans is going to be difficult. This is a challenge faced by anyone wanting to develop a therapy for a human disorder such as dementia. Human lifespan is very extensive. So the question would be, when would be the most appropriate time to give these kinds of medications? Over what period of time do you need to evaluate the effects? In humans it could be years before an effect is noticed.”

“Finally, there is the issue surrounding safety. With a cannabinoid like THC, which does have adverse effects in certain individuals, there would be worries about the chronic dosing of this kind of medicine. We would need to assess the safety first before going into seeing whether it would improve cognition.""",Can Marijuana Restore Memory?

Enlarge this image toggle caption technotr/Getty Images technotr/Getty Images

A little spit may help predict whether a child's concussion symptoms will subside in days or persist for weeks.

A test that measures fragments of genetic material in saliva was nearly 90 percent accurate in identifying children and adolescents whose symptoms persisted for at least a month, a Penn State team told the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco, Calif. In contrast, a concussion survey commonly used by doctors was right less than 70 percent of the time.

If the experimental test pans out, ""a pediatrician could collect saliva with a swab, send it off to the lab and then be able to call the family the next day,"" says Steven Hicks, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State Hershey. Hicks helped develop the test and consults for a company that hopes to market concussion tests.

A reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Many of the injuries are related to sports.

In most cases, concussion symptoms last only a few days. But up to 25 percent of young patients ""go on to have these prolonged headaches, fatigue, nausea, and those symptoms can last sometimes one to four months,"" Hicks says.

And, right now, there's no way to know which kids are going to have long-term problems, he says.

""Parents often say that their biggest concern is, 'When is my child going to be back to normal again?' "" Hicks says. ""And that's something we have a very difficult time predicting.""

Hicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help.

They knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. As a part of this process, brain cells release tiny fragments of genetic material called microRNAs. Some of these fragments eventually turn up in blood and even in saliva.

The team did an experiment that involved 50 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 18.

""When they came to our medical center and received the diagnosis of concussion, we evaluated them with some standard survey-based tools and then we also got a sample of their saliva,"" Hicks says. Most samples were collected about a week after the injury.

The team measured levels of many different microRNAs in the samples, and eventually they identified a handful that let them predict how long symptoms would last. They also identified one microRNA that predicted which children would have a specific concussion symptom: difficulties with memory and problem solving, Hicks says.

A saliva test could greatly improve care for young people who don't have obvious symptoms of a concussion, says Manish Bhomia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.

""A lot of children get mild concussion and oftentimes it goes ignored,"" he says.

A reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don't go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says.

And microRNAs offer a promising way to assess concussions in adults as well as children, says Bhomia, whose research involves a range of ""biomarkers"" for traumatic brain injury.

But saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says. A better option, he says, might be blood samples, which tend to contain greater numbers of the genetic fragments.",Spit Test May Reveal The Severity Of A Child's Concussion,3,NPR

WEDNESDAY, May 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A new study finds that people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who haven't done well on other treatments may find relief with Xeljanz (tofacitinib), a drug currently used to treat arthritis.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF).

The illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.

""There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,"" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.

Xeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body's inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don't, the researchers said.

""Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" Sandborn said.

The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.

Whether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

Because Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.

""How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,"" Swaminath said. ""I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.""

The researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.

The first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer ""tumor necrosis factor antagonist"" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.

In the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.

In the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.

In the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.

In the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.

However, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.

In addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.

Also, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.

The report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She's also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.

""Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],"" Friedman said.

An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.

""Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,"" she said. ""Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.""

The international research project into the impact of depression on pregnant mothers and their babies, led by Professor Sonia Bhalotra from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, could have major implications for public policy.

More than 400 million people worldwide report episodes of depression, at a global cost of around £600bn in 2010. Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is “based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle”.

CBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.

While studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.

The study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.

Returning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.

The study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.

“These findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,” Bhalotra said. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now – their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.”",Therapy ‘has long-term benefits for mothers with depression’,2,The Guardian

44 percent report they did not consult a gynecologist for finding a solution.

4 percent only recognized the common symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

Estrogen is the best treatment option for VVA since it rehydrates the vagina and restores lubrication and pH balance in the vagina. Unfortunately, this is not always an appropriate option, especially if you have breast cancer or are unable or unwilling to be on estrogen. Other medication options include Osphena, vaginal estrogen, steroid and testosterone creams, and lubrications or moisturizers.

The Mona Lisa Touch Laser Treatment, or MLLT, is one of the newest kids on the block to combat vaginal atrophy. There are other types of vaginal lasers, but they don't have the same track record, Food and Drug Administration support and long-term studies as the MLLT. An Italian-built laser device, the Mona Lisa Touch Laser holds tremendous promise in treating a vagina that has been transformed in menopause or via cancer treatment side effects.

Once you've had a pelvic exam to assure you're an appropriate candidate, a physician trained in the use of the Mona Lisa – which is actually a small vaginal laser – inserts the device into the vagina during three 4-minute sessions, six weeks apart. Many women report positive changes after just the first 4-minute treatment, which involves removing the dried skin inside that vagina, stimulating collagen and blood flow production, and allowing vaginal revival. The end result is a vagina makeover – a new lease on a vagina, if you will – with more elasticity and natural lubrication of the tissue inside the vagina. Although it may sound too good to be true, the results are proving to be a game changer in the way vagina atrophy is being treated – without hormones – which is a relief to many women and their partners.

Mona Lisa is ideal for women who can't take estrogen due to a personal or family history of breast cancer or for those who are unhappy with the side effects associated with hormone replacement therapy. Still, there is a painful part of the procedure: the cost. It runs about $1,000 a session and is most likely not covered by insurance.",Treating Vulvo-Vaginal Atrophy,2,The Guardian
story_reviews_00246,"A minimally invasive procedure designed to shrink prostate tissue with a series of nine-second blasts of steam offers men a new treatment for urinary symptoms commonly associated with enlarged prostates.

The procedure, called Rezūm (pronounced “resume”) and developed by NxThera Inc. of Maple Grove, Minn., became widely available in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. Thermal energy in the form of steam is applied to the prostate with a needle. As it cools it releases heat energy into the tissue, killing cells and shrinking the prostate overall by about a third, says Bob Paulson, NxThera’s chief executive.

Some 50% of men over the age of 50 have enlarged prostates, which can produce symptoms such as increased urgency to urinate during the day and frequent urination, which disrupts sleep at night. Sufferers often must choose between surgery or medication, both of which have side effects, including sexual dysfunction.

The NxThera therapy is the second major innovation in recent years for men with enlarged prostates. The other, an implanted device called UroLift, was introduced in the U.S. in 2013 by NeoTract Inc. of Pleasanton, Calif.

After years of little improvement in the minimally invasive treatment of enlarged prostates, men now have two new options “that leave your sexual function intact,” says Claus G. Roehrborn, a professor and chairman of the department of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a co-author of published studies on both treatments.

Middle ground

Physicians say Rezūm can be used on a wider range of prostate anatomies than the UroLift implant. The procedure, which costs about $2,000 and generally is covered by insurance, can be done in a doctor’s office in just a few minutes. To dull pain, lidocaine may be injected into the prostate, and most doctors will offer a sedative for patients who want one. After the procedure, most patients need to wear a catheter for two or three days but can return to daily activities immediately.

While the results of a two-year clinical trial published by Dr. Roehrborn and colleagues show that Rezūm provides significant relief from symptoms, it isn’t clear how long the improvement will last.

“The durability issue is what’s going to sink or swim this procedure,” says study co-author Kevin T. McVary, chairman and professor of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, in Springfield, Ill. Both minimally invasive options are likely less effective than surgery, Dr. Roehrborn says, because surgery removes the most tissue.

Still, for many men, the steam treatment offers an appealing middle ground between the risk of surgery and the hassle and side effects of taking daily medication, which can cause dizziness and fatigue.

“I tried Flomax for about two years but the side effects were too annoying,” says Stephen Gooding, a 60-year-old utility supervisor from Grayson, Ga., who says the drug made him dizzy and constipated. He had the Rezūm procedure in October, and now “I feel like I did 30 years ago.”

In the two-year study of 197 men, funded by NxThera and published online in the Journal of Urology in December, patients who had the Rezūm procedure showed a significantly greater improvement in symptoms at three months compared with patients who had a sham procedure. At the end of two years, patients treated with Rezūm showed a 51% reduction in urinary symptoms (as measured by a seven-question survey), compared with the beginning of the study.

Over the two years, about 4% of the patients who underwent Rezūm had to have a repeat procedure or surgery to treat their condition. Early in the trial, physicians were new at performing the procedure and didn’t always remove enough tissue, says Cindy Ogden, vice president, clinical affairs at NxThera.

So far, Rezūm appears to spare men sexual side effects. In the surgical procedure known as transurethral resection, 70% to 80% of men generally get a condition called retrograde ejaculation, also called dry orgasm, says Dr. McVary.

In the Rezūm study, about 3% of the patients who underwent the procedure experienced no ejaculatory volume afterward, and 5.3% experienced a decrease in ejaculatory volume, according to data provided by NxThera. Ejaculatory volume can fluctuate over time in men with enlarged prostates, so it isn’t clear the reductions were caused by the procedure, Dr. McVary says. Overall in the study, there was no average change in ejaculatory volume, he adds.

Larger prostates

A major advantage of Rezūm is that it can be done on most types of anatomies. UroLift isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the median, or middle lobe of the prostate, which contributes to symptoms in about 10% to 30% of patients, Dr. Roehrborn says.

The FDA hasn’t cleared Rezūm or UroLift for prostates weighing more than 80 grams. So NxThera can’t market its procedure for larger prostates, though doctors can legally use it on such patients if they choose.

Early results in clinical practice on large prostates appear “promising” and a study on prostates up to 150 grams is expected to begin later this year, says Ricardo Gonzalez, a urologist at Texas Medical Center in Houston, who will be a principal investigator on the research. About a quarter of men seeking treatment for prostate-related urinary symptoms have prostates greater than 80 grams, he says.

Business executive Jim Bracke, 69, says that, with just a Tylenol and the lidocaine shot, discomfort from Rezūm’s steam blasts felt no more intense than “warm water spilled on the groin.” He drove himself home after the procedure, and says he’s thrilled that he no longer needs to check out a bathroom the moment he arrives at a restaurant. And as long as he doesn’t overdo it, he adds, “I can have beer, and coffee and chocolate and still sleep through the night.”

story_reviews_00247,"(CNN) Finding ways to fight the flu just got a tad more ribbeting -- that is, if you ask some researchers who have turned their attention to frogs.

A new study suggests that mucus from the skin of certain frogs can be harnessed to obliterate flu viruses.

Some frog mucus contains antimicrobial peptides, which are immune system molecules that can neutralize bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

However, the flu-killing power of such peptides has been demonstrated only under a microscope and in lab mice. More research is needed to determine just how effective a peptide can be in helping humans beat the flu.

""We have identified a potentially new treatment for H1N1 human influenza virus, which is a peptide that comes from the skin of a frog from southern India,"" said Joshy Jacob , an associate professor in the Emory University School of Medicine's microbiology and immunology department, who led the study.

The peptide, named urumin, specifically targets H1 flu viruses, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Immunity

""This peptide works by directly killing the virus, and it is specific for all influenza viruses that have a H1 type of hemagglutinin,"" Jacob said.

Hemagglutinin is a spike-shaped protein found on the surface of flu viruses. For the viruses to make you sick, the spikes of hemagglutinin attach to your cells to infect them.

'It makes the virus particle fall apart'

For the study, skin secretions were collected from 15 frogs, of the species Hydrophylax bahuvistara , which are about the size of a tennis ball and brightly colored. Peptides were then gathered from their secretions.

A Hydrophylax bahuvistara frog in its native environment in southern India.

The researchers observed how the peptides interacted with influenza viruses under a microscope and in mice.

""In this paper we screened 32 peptides, and the surprise was that four out of 32 had activity against the virus,"" Jacob said.

""Out of the four, we found one of them (urumin) was non-toxic to human cells,"" he said. ""So, we tested it against viruses that came from the 1930s until the current ones, and it kills all of the H1s. It doesn't touch H3. It's very, very specific.""

Professor Joshy Jacob, in middle, seen with his colleagues David Holthausen (on left) and Song Hee Lee (on right).

The researchers aren't quite sure why urumin only targets H1 viruses, but Jacob said that H1 viruses might be anatomically similar to an amphibian pathogen that the frog mucus is intended to destroy. If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin's wrath.

""The frog makes this peptide for its own survival. It never gets influenza,"" Jacob said, adding that the peptide fights the flu virus by destroying an important part of the hemagglutinin.

To explain how the peptide works, Jacob likened hemagglutinin to a billboard sign.

""You have the message and then you have the little stem that holds it up. The message can change but the stem is the same, and this peptide targets the stem of the hemagglutinin, that's why it's very efficient,"" he said.

The urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said.

""It just blows it up. It makes the virus particle fall apart,"" he said.

Gregory Chinchar, a professor in the University of Mississippi Medical Center's department of microbiology and immunology, said that he was surprised that the peptide targeted the hemagglutinin on the flu virus. He was not involved in the new study.

""I don't think people thought that they work that way before,"" Chinchar said about the peptide. ""They thought that they would be more targeted to membranes, but the data looks like they target the H1 protein specifically and that data looks pretty firm.""

The history of 'milking' frog skin

It was first discovered that frogs had a special way of warding off bacteria and other pathogens in ancient Russia, when live Russian Brown frogs were dropped into milk to keep the milk from going sour, according to the American Chemical Society

""The milk stayed good, just like you refrigerated it,"" Jacob said about the age-old Russian practice.

""In 2012, scientists took that particular frog and wanted to know why is it, why do these frogs keep milk fresh? It turned out that when you shock a frog or when you stimulate them or stress them, they secrete these short peptides into their surroundings,"" he said. ""A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad.""

Separate studies have also shown that various amphibian and fish antimicrobial peptides play important roles in protecting the animals against invasive pathogens, including viruses.

""Amphibians, especially certain groups of frogs, produce and store large amounts of antimicrobial peptides in specialized granular glands in the skin,"" said Louise Rollins-Smith, associate professor of pathology, microbiology, and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ""When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin.""

Rollins-Smith, who was not involved in the new study, has conducted separate research on whether certain antimicrobial peptides in frogs might hold clues to preventing HIV transmission

""The peptide described in the Immunity report is somewhat unusual because of the apparent specificity,"" Rollins-Smith said about how urumin specifically targets H1 viruses.

""If further studies show that it has a low level of cytotoxicity and it can protect in other animal models of influenza, it could be developed as a potential treatment for influenza,"" she said. Cytoxicity refers to being toxic to cells in the body.

""As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved,"" she said.

Ferrets are next, then possibly humans

A challenge to possibly using frog mucus as a flu-fighting treatment in humans is figuring out how to get the urumin peptide to attach to flu virus cells in the human body, Jacob said.

In the new study, the peptide was delivered to mice through their noses, where flu viruses were also delivered.

""I need to come up with a strategy to deliver it systemically as well; maybe an injectable, which goes in the bloodstream and kills influenza viruses,"" Jacob mused.

to duplicate their study findings in ferrets, which are For now, Jacob said that his colleagues and he are hopingto duplicate their study findings in ferrets, which are often used in influenza virus research , and they hope to secure funding for additional studies.

story_reviews_00248,"The new study is the latest chapter in an extraordinary, decades-long collaboration among cognitive scientists, brain surgeons and people with severe epilepsy being evaluated for an operation. The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients’ consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.

This approach — called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes — has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.

In a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient’s high- and low-functioning states.

Each participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.

The team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state — and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said. “And when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.”

Dr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. “Each seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren’t attached to anything,” Dr. Greenblatt said.","‘Pacemaker’ for the Brain Can Help Memory, Study Finds",3,New York Times

story_reviews_00250,"Army veteran Vivian Cooke has long struggled with debilitating depression. She has tried alternative therapies and medication to cope with her symptoms.

“It wasn’t effective. Some side effects would be headaches or stomachache,” she told CBS News.

Then three years ago, she decided to try something different after hearing about a study testing Botox to treat depression.

While Botox is commonly used for cosmetic purposes, doctors say the reasoning behind the treatment for depression may not be what you expect.

“We don’t believe it has anything to do with looks,” says researcher Dr. Eric Finzi of Chevy Chase Cosmetic Center.

Rather, he says it’s because facial expressions are part of the circuit of the brain related to mood.

“Fear, anger and sadness — all go through this muscle,” Finzi told CBS News, pointing out the area between the eyebrows where frown lines appear. “So Botox basically inhibits the muscle and calms it down, so it becomes more difficult to feel those negative emotions.”

The makers of Botox recently announced plans for the final phase of testing it as a treatment for depression. Finzi notes previous studies show between 50 to 60 percent of patients may benefit from the treatment.

“Our hope is eventually it will form a place as one of the tools to treat depression,” he said.

Botox is a prescription drug that blocks nerve signals to muscles in the injection area. Its effects are temporary and typically wear off after three months. Botox is currently FDA approved for cosmetic use to lessen frown lines, and for medical use to treat a number of conditions including chronic migraines, bladder incontinence, excessive underarm perspiration, and certain types of neck pain and eye issues. Costs vary widely, but the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery said the average price for a Botox treatment in 2016 was $376.

Researchers are also studying whether Botox can treat social anxiety and bipolar disorder.

As for Cooke, she said she noticed a change in her depression almost immediately.

“I found overall my mood was better on a day-to-day basis,” she said. “I had less problems with depression.”

story_reviews_00251,"A study released April 12, 2017, suggests restrictions on heart-damaging fats in restaurant food may have helped prevent heart attacks in several New York counties. (Photo: Dima Gavrysh / AP)

Chicago — Local bans on artery-clogging trans fats in restaurant foods led to fewer heart attacks and strokes in several New York counties, a new study suggests.

The study hints at the potential for widespread health benefits from an upcoming nationwide ban, the authors and other experts say. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 gave the food industry until next year to eliminate artificial trans fats from American products.

New York City enacted a restaurant ban on the fats in 2007 and several counties in the state did the same. Hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes in those areas declined 6 percent starting three years after the bans, compared with counties without bans. The results translate to 43 fewer heart attacks and strokes per 100,000 people, said lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, a Yale University cardiology fellow.

His study was published Wednesday in JAMA Cardiology.

Trans fats, also called partially hydrogenated oils, enhance food texture and structure. They were once commonly used to make restaurant fried chicken, French fries, doughnuts and other foods and found in grocery items including cookies, crackers and margarine.

These fats can boost blood levels of unhealthy cholesterol, increasing risks for heart problems. The FDA in 2006 required them to be listed on food labels and the food industry has been switching to healthier oils.

The researchers examined hospital admissions data from 2002 to 2013 in 11 New York counties that adopted bans and in 25 counties that did not. Admissions for heart attacks and strokes declined in all counties, going from more than 800 to less than 700 per 100,000 people, but the drop was steeper in counties that enacted bans.

Alice Lichtenstein, a heart and nutrition specialist at Tufts University’s Boston campus, said the results are encouraging but that other changes could have contributed, such as smoking bans and mandatory calories on menus.

Dr. Mark Creager, former American Heart Association president, said the results echo previous studies “and are consistent with the thinking of most scientists” on potential benefits of these bans.

“Policies such as these when adapted on a nationwide level will be good for our entire population,” said Creager, director of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center’s heart center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

(Reuters Health) - - People were less likely to go to the hospital with heart attacks or strokes after several counties in New York State restricted the use of trans fats, according to a new study.

Trans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They’re found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture.

“New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

New York City limited the use of trans fats starting in July 2007. The restrictions applied to food purchased outside of stores, such as at restaurants, street vendors and bakeries, in the city’s five counties. Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City’s measure was enacted.

Previous research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.

For the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn’t restrict trans fats.

Altogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.

In 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.

While admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.

After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.

Admissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.

Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Those included clean air initiatives and showing calorie counts on restaurant menus.

When they removed New York City data to make sure those other factors weren’t driving the findings, the pattern didn’t change.

“We still found the same thing,” Brandt said.

Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties.

Brandt and colleagues write that in 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed manufactured trans fats from its list of safe food additives. By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.

“There has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,” said Brandt. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”

The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.

story_reviews_00254,"Dr. Maximilian Muenke has a superpower: He can diagnose disease just by looking at a person’s face.

Specifically, he can spot certain genetic disorders that make telltale impressions on facial features.

“Once you’ve done it for a certain amount of years, you walk into a room and it’s like, oh, that child has Williams syndrome,” he said, referring to a genetic disorder that can affect a person’s cognitive abilities and heart.

advertisement

And that’s an incredibly useful skill, even as genetic sequencing becomes more widespread. For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don’t have access to genetic tests at all.

That’s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient’s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.

Some older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners — a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.

Meanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.

It’s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics’ systemic blind spots.

Diagnoses vs. probabilities

The algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They’re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.

But they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall “look” of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won’t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, “Does my patient have a genetic disorder?”

That’s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases — a means to an end.

“We are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,” said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.

Drawing that bright line between Face2Gene and “a diagnostic tool” allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.

Diversity needed

The algorithm the NIH uses — developed by scientists at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., — seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.

Face2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. “Since Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,” Gelbman cautioned.

But there’s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.

“In every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,” Muenke said. “When I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren’t. There just aren’t.” (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH’s work.)

So diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn’t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. “We have thought about it but haven’t gone there yet,” Muenke said.

For example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges — as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome — the angles between landmark points on the child’s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children’s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other “typical” features weren’t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.

In fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. “One of the findings that I’m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,” Linguraru said.

To continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients’ faces — but that’s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH’s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.

Those numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. “Most practitioners are located in North America and Europe,” Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn’t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.

It’s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH’s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 “skinny” budget proposal announced in March.)

For now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm’s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

As both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, April 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report another step in the use of stem cells to help treat people with debilitating heart failure.

In an early study of 27 patients, Japanese researchers used patients' own muscle stem cells to create a ""patch"" that was placed on the heart.

Over the next year, the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms -- including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued.

However, experts cautioned that while the results are encouraging, there's a lot of work left ahead before stem cells can be used to treat heart failure.

""They've shown that this approach is feasible,"" said Dr. Eiran Gorodeski, a heart failure specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

But it's not clear whether the stem-cell tactic was actually effective, said Gorodeski, who was not involved in the study.

That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells.

So it's possible, Gorodeski explained, that the ""modest"" symptom improvements would have happened anyway. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.

Stem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.

Heart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.

Symptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.

In the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.

That's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.

The patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.

He said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.

To test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.

The sheet was placed on each patient's heart.

The tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.

Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.

The stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that ""hibernating"" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.

Still, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.

This type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.

Those trials are underway, Sawa said.

Other studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.

Patients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.

So it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.

For now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.

""There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,"" Gorodeski said.

The message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for ""innovative"" ways to improve that treatment.

The study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Is running really a better form of exercise than walking, given that running can lead to more injuries?

At Vox, I sit near health reporter Sarah Kliff, who trains for half-marathons and triathlons with a casualness most people reserve for grocery shopping. But Sarah’s also suffered with plantar fasciitis and a stress fracture. At times, she's hobbled around in running shoes for months because everything else hurt too much, and even sported a big blue brace on her left leg to help cushion the tiny cracks in the bones of her foot brought on from too much wear and tear.

In many ways, Sarah is a perfect case study in how to think about the benefits and risks of running versus walking. Running has greater health benefits than walking (Sarah is super fit), but it also carries a much bigger risk of injury (see Sarah’s foot brace).



So which effect dominates? To find out, I first searched for ""randomized control trials"" and ""systematic reviews"" on running, walking, and exercise at PubMed health (a free search engine for health research) and in Google Scholar. I wanted to see what the highest-quality evidence — trials and reviews are the gold standard — said about the relative risks and benefits of these two forms of exercise.

It was immediately apparent that running can lead to more injuries, and the risk goes up as running programs get more intense. Studies have found that runners have significantly higher injury rates than walkers (one study found that young men who run or jog had a 25 percent higher risk of injuries than walkers), and that ultramarathoners are at an even greater risk. The main running-related injuries include tibia stress syndrome, Achilles tendon injuries, and plantar fasciitis.

Overall, more than half of people who run will experience some sort of injury from doing so, while the percentage of walkers who will get hurt is around 1 percent. Interestingly, it seems you can walk pretty much endlessly without any increased risk of hurting yourself.

That running hurts people shouldn't be surprising. As this study described, ""Running produces ground reaction forces that are approximately 2.5 times body weight, while the ground reaction force during walking is in the range of 1.2 times body weight."" You're also more likely to trip and fall while running than you are during a walk.

Jogging even 5 to 10 minutes per day can reduce the risk of death from all causes I also learned about some of the incredible health benefits of going fast: Even five to 10 minutes per day of jogging at around 6 miles per hour can reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and other causes. Joggers have been found to live longer than non-joggers even after adjusting for other factors — a difference of 3.8 years for men and 4.7 years for women.

That said, research has found that walking carries significant health benefits, as well. Some studies suggest that you can extend your life and stave off disease by simply walking — and the more, the better.

All this research, while illuminating, didn’t offer up any clear conclusions on whether running or walking was better for you overall. So I asked some of the world’s leading researchers in this area. Their conclusion? You need to consider the trade-offs.

""Running moderately prolongs life more than walking does,"" said Peter Schnohr, a clinical cardiologist who has researched many aspects of exercise and health. The key word there is ""moderately."" Schnohr warned of the emerging research that doing a lot of endurance exercise over the long term (like triathlon training) can lead to heart problems. Overall, there's a U-shaped association between running and mortality, he said. Too little isn't helpful for health, but too much might be harmful.



""The most favorable regimen is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace""

""The most favorable [regimen] is two to three running days per week, at a slow or average pace,"" Schnohr advised. ""Running every day, at a fast speed, more than 4 hours per week is not as favorable."" And for those who don't like running, he noted, ""Fast walking, not slow, also prolongs life. I can’t tell how much.""

Dutch researcher Luiz Carlos Hespanhol pointed out that in general, running simply delivers health benefits more efficiently than walking does. This study, for example, found that five minutes of running per day is as beneficial as 15 minutes of walking. Hespanhol also said that after one year of training just two hours a week, runners lose weight, reduce their body fat, lower their resting heart rates, and drive down their blood serum triglycerides (fat in the blood). There's even evidence that running can have positive effects on tension, depression, and anger.

Even so, Hespanhol wasn't a total cheerleader for running. A good walking regimen can have similar benefits, he noted. So on running versus walking, it really depends on your values and preferences: ""One could choose walking instead of running as a mode of physical activity based on injury risks, since walking is less risky than running,"" he explained. Or alternatively: ""One could choose running because the health benefits are larger and come faster, in a shorter period of time.""

To recap: Running improves your health more efficiently than walking does and has greater health benefits per time invested. But even a small amount of running carries more injury risk than walking. And a lot of running (i.e., ultramarathon training) can well be harmful, while the same is never true for walking.

Where does this leave us? All the exercise researchers seemed to agree on one thing: that the best exercise routine is the one you'll actually do. So the answer to the running versus walking question will probably vary from person to person. If you prefer one over the other, stick with that. And if you still can't decide, Hespanhol suggested this: ""Why not do both — running and walking — in order to get the best of each?""

story_reviews_00257,"(CNN) An aspirin a day may keep the doctor away. It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer.

Yin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington.

Cao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012.

Over that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.

The strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.

""Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,"" Cao said. ""It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.""

Not everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people.

Rulla Tamimi , the epidemiology chair for the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, thought the presentation was a beneficial one, particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets.

""There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,"" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. ""This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.""

Studies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago.

In April 2016, the US Preventive Service Task Force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular low-dose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between 50 and 69 who have a 10% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer.

story_reviews_00258,"NEW YORK -- Three years ago, Tomas Sandoval was looking forward to the birth of his second child when he was diagnosed with a rare form of a blood cancer called lymphoma.

Thomas Sandoval CBS News

Despite chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, the cancer returned before his daughter’s first birthday.

“Everything is at stake. Being around for my daughter, my son, my wife. Yeah it was a really tough time,” he said.

Sandoval is alive today because of an experimental form of immunotherapy called CAR-T.

Normally, our immune cells are good at killing invaders like bacteria but bad at fighting cancer. With CAR-T, a patient’s own immune cells are removed from the body, reprogrammed to find and destroy cancer cells, then put back into the bloodstream.

On Friday, Moffitt Cancer Center and MD Anderson reported test results of 101 patients with advanced lymphoma who had failed previous therapy and were treated with CAR-T.

“It puts a GPS navigation on the front of the cell so that when they’re infused back in they know where to go and kill the lymphoma,” said Dr. Frederick Locke, who helped lead the trial.

Dr. Frederick Locke CBS News

About eight months after a single treatment, 39 percent of patients had no evidence of cancer.

“That’s actually quite remarkable knowing that at best only one out of 10 of these patients could have complete disappearance of their lymphoma with standard chemotherapy,” Locke said.

Side effects included flu-like symptoms and confusion, and there were three treatment-related deaths.

The FDA will review these results and could make a decision on approval by the end of the year.",Promising new lymphoma treatment gets fast-tracked by FDA,2,CBS News
story_reviews_00259,"This article is featured in Newsweek's Special Edition: Nature's Remedies—Heal Your Body.

One of the leading causes of disability in the United States isn’t physical—it’s mental. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), 15 million adults—approximately 6.7 percent of the population—suffer from major depressive disorder, which is most often treated through a combination of talk therapy and medication. Those who struggle with depression have imbalanced levels of serotonin, which maintains mood, and dopamine, which controls the pleasure and reward zones. The brain’s synapses control how much of these chemicals are released, and drugs like Zoloft effectively prevent the little serotonin being produced from reabsorbing back into the nerve cells from which they were released, resulting in a higher concentration of serotonin. Some pill-averse patients have longed for a natural cure for depression, while others complain that the drugs they’re on aren’t enough. Hope for both groups may have arrived through an unlikely source: magnets. Researchers discovered they can harness the power of magnetism to increase serotonin production and combat depression through a process called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

“Each [symptom of depression] maps onto a given circuit of the brain,” neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone told NPR in April 2016 about treating patients using TMS. “The reason why that circuit of the brain is not functioning properly...has to do with a deficit of a certain chemical in the brain. But the point is that if we can identify the circuit that causes the symptoms, we can target that circuit and make it function better through brain stimulation. So, in a sense, [TMS is] not a treatment...for the ultimate cause of the disorder, but it’s an intervention that improves how the patient is able to function.”

PHILIPPE GARO/SCIENCE SOURCE

TMS has a lot in common with a traditional MRI scan. In fact, the only clue TMS treatment contains magnets at all is that patients must remove any jewelry and stow their credit cards (to prevent demagnetization) before treatment. According to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s description of the technique, a coil is fitted to the front of a patient’s head so the electromagnetic pulses can target the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which controls emotion. A physician then tests the machine to see how much power is needed to affect the patient’s reflexes. Once the patient’s thumb involuntarily twitches, the current is strong enough to affect the patient’s brain activity. At this point, specific symptoms can be targeted depending on the patient’s needs.

The biggest drawback to TMS, according to advocates, is the limitations on just who can undergo the treatment. Though it was approved by the FDA in 2008, its use is federally restricted with exemptions only for those with severe depression, autism or Parkinson’s. Even those who are approved to undergo the treatment face another barrier as TMS is not widely covered by health insurance. Its efficacy varies from patient to patient and, like most prescriptions for depression, TMS has its own set of side-effects. The most common, not surprisingly, are headaches. Although one-third of patients have reported experiencing painful scalp sensations and facial twitching, these tend to fade after several treatments.

Despite these setbacks, researchers are optimistic about TMS—and not just as a form of treatment for depression. Experiments treating Parkinson’s and autism, the other two conditions for which TMS is approved, have seen some success among neurologists. More studies will be needed to determine whether this method can be used as a widespread treatment for other brain-related disorders, but if today’s research is any indication, TMS could be a key to improving the lives of Americans suffering from a multitude of disorders.

One study also examined functions of the eye itself and found none of these improvements were because of changes in the eye. They’re all in the brain.

Various smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.

Perceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called “lazy eye,” which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).

It should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. One study published in Psychological Science trained 16 college-aged adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1.5 hours per day for seven days. After training, the older adults’ ability to see low-contrast images improved to the level that the college-age ones had before training.

story_reviews_00263,"There’s another type of prescription drugs, besides opioid painkillers, that’s involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US every year.

The drugs are benzodiazepines, which are widely known by their brand names Xanax and Valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety. These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there’s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.

A new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.

The study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.

The study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose–related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller–related overdose deaths in 2015.

Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren’t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. “Even if we didn’t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,” Humphreys said.

Yet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent — a nearly 89 percent jump.

For some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives — to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there’s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren’t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)

There are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)

Finally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it’s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users — perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.

Still, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk. So it’s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose — or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.

Given that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it’s important — and potentially lifesaving — for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study’s findings.

story_reviews_00264,"What would happen if screening for male infertility was just about as easy as taking a pregnancy test in your home bathroom?

That’s the question researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone-based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes.

The test delivered impressive results, identifying abnormal semen samples with approximately 98 percent accuracy according to the researchers, who published their findings Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Infertility affects up to 12 percent of the male population worldwide. Though it’s as common as female infertility, it often goes unrecognized due to factors like cultural stigma, the high cost and time required for testing, and access to laboratory facilities.

As things stand now, men have to provide samples “in these specific rooms in hospitals under so much stress and embarrassment,” the study’s principal investigator, Hadi Shafiee, PhD, told CBS News.

His team’s new approach aims to change that with a simple and inexpensive at-home test option.

The smartphone-based test involves several distinct parts: one, a disposable device on which to place the sample, including a disposable microchip that handles the sample; two, an optical attachment that connects to a smartphone; three, an app that guides the user through each step of testing. The researchers say the optical attachment could be created by 3D-printing, and the device would only cost about $5.

The testing kit also includes a tiny weight scale that connects wirelessly to the testing app and measures the total number of sperm swimming in the sample.

The March 22, 2017 cover of the journal Science Translational Medicine depicts a smartphone-based test for male infertility. Gilank Bara Verdana / Ravastra Design Studio, Science Translational Medicine

The researchers tested the device on 350 clinical semen specimens in Massachusetts, including both trained and untrained users in their trial.

“The accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer-assisted laboratory analysis, even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background,” they wrote in the study.

The app is similar to a fitness tracker, in a sense, in that it stores any history of previous semen samples as well. The app’s user experience is hard to forget: users can see vivid moving images of their sperm right on the screen.

Though the system is in the prototyping stage, it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy, cheap testing.

In addition, the developers say it could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress at home following surgery. Currently, they’re required to make office visits to a urologist for several months to ensure that the operation was successful.

Shafiee’s team plans to continue refining the test and then file for approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other home-based tests are already on the market, but Boston researchers say their version can analyze additional aspects of the sample, checking how well the sperm move (known as motility) as well as their concentration.

Results showed some gender-based disparities. Women in the treatment group had an average diastolic blood pressure reduction of 6 mmHg while men in the same group had an average 4 mmHg reduction.

“The electronic counseling (e-Counseling) intervention had an effect similar to that of adding an additional blood-pressure-lowering medication,” said Robert P. Nolan, the lead author of the study, a senior scientist at the Peter Munk Cardiac Center at the University Health Network and an associate professor at the University of Toronto.

The randomized, double-blind study included 264 participants with an average age of 58, of whom 58 percent were women. The participants were divided into two groups, one of which received weekly emails with generic information about healthy living that is good for the heart and for reducing high blood pressure, and the other group received weekly emails with links to interactive tools and online multimedia, such as videos of people diagnosed with high blood pressure who made lifestyle changes. These tools were carefully chosen to increase in knowledge about and motivation to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle.

“In the e-Counseling intervention we tried to replicate the experience of going through face-to-face lifestyle counseling for a year,” Nolan said.

High blood pressure affects 1 in every 3 adults in the United States, according to a fact sheet by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2013, high blood pressure was the major cause behind 360,000 deaths in the United States. Reduction in high blood pressure has added health benefits because it can potentially reduce the likelihood of heart attacks, strokes, chronic heart failure and kidney disease.

Engaging patients in such a way could be a very powerful tool in promoting behavioral change, Nolan said.

“I am so happy to see this on the agenda for three main reasons. In part, most of the studies here today show what to do — not how to achieve it,” said Eric Peterson, a professor at Duke University School of Medicine and an associate editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, during the conference. “Secondly, we only look at the trade-off between efficacy and safety, but your study is looking more at efficacy and effectiveness and practicality, issues that are also very important. And finally, this is a very real world study.”

The study was received well by the audience. “No one should die of hypertension. The study is very useful in telling and confirming that we should talk to the patients, no matter how we do it,” said Bernard Wong, a cardiologist based in Hong Kong.

One of the caveats of the study was that participants were highly motivated people looking for ways to cope with and decrease their blood pressure. Participants were also largely white and well-educated, with most having a postsecondary education, so the results of the study might not be generalize well to other groups.

story_reviews_00266,"Many Americans would rather take a drug than change their habits to control a persistent ailment. Yet, every medication has side effects, some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat. Drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards, both bothersome and severe, that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time.

Such is the case with a popular class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s, now used by more than 15 million Americans and many more people worldwide to counter an increasingly common ailment: acid reflux, which many people refer to as heartburn or indigestion.

These medications are now linked to a growing number of complications, ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies, joint pain and infections to bone fractures, heart attacks and dementia. While definitive evidence for most of the risks identified thus far is lacking, consumers plagued by acid reflux would be wise to consider an alternative approach, namely diet and lifestyle changes that can minimize symptoms and even heal damage already done.

Acid reflux is more than just a nuisance. It involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it. It results when the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach, fails to close tightly enough to prevent the contents of the stomach from moving up instead of down.

TRENTON, N.J. — Cardboard boxes certainly aren’t new technology. But when they’re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they’re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.

Williams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.

She now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he’s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.

‘‘Open your mouth and say I’m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,’’ Williams said.

Sudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren’t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they’re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.

Ohio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.

The Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.’s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.

The idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.

The boxes are a new idea for many Americans.

‘‘The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like ‘wow that’s weird,’’’ said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.

Peterson’s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.

McCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don’t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants’ sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.

‘‘No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,’’ she said. ‘‘They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it’s not safe.’’

To get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes. The boxes can also be sent in the mail, if a nearby hospital is not designated as a distribution center.",Forget cribs.

story_reviews_00270,"(Reuters Health) - Improvement or worsening of chest pain symptoms and quality of life after a CT scan of the heart may depend on what the scan finds, a large study suggests.

People who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.

Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.

“Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.

“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.

Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.

Newby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.

When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.

This reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.

The findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.

“Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.

If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.

“If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”

“It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.

“In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.

story_reviews_00271,"Deep sleep is critical to maintaining a robust memory, but both decline with age. A small new study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called “pink noise”—a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better-known cousin, “white noise.”

It may sound strange, but previous studies have found that playing so-called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults. “We wanted to see if it would work in older people, too,” says senior author Dr. Phyllis Zee, professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.

Zee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.

On one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. “The noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,” says Zee. “It’s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it’s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.” The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.

(Here’s what pink noise sounded like to study participants, in the box below.)

After analyzing everyone’s sleep waves, the team found that people’s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.

Northwestern has a patent pending on the new technology, and one of the study authors has cofounded a company that plans to market it commercially. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. The researchers hope to develop an affordable device that people can use at home.

Zee says that the effectiveness of pink noise is all in the timing. “The effect here, at least for memory, is quite related to the ability of the sound stimulus to enhance slow-wave sleep,” she says. “That’s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on.”

That doesn’t mean there aren’t benefits to other soothing background sounds. Music, nature sounds and white (or pink) noise apps may still help improve sleep, she says—which, in itself, is good for the body and for the brain.

story_reviews_00272,"Eating More — Or Less — Of 10 Foods May Cut Risk Of Early Death

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Taylor/Getty Images Paul Taylor/Getty Images

About half of all U.S. deaths from heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes are linked to poor diets, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

And eating more — or less — of just 10 types of food can help raise or lower the risk of death from these causes, the researchers found.

Scientists at Tufts University identified the foods that seem to contribute the most to the risk. At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths.

Next — and I sympathize with all of you who love to eat these — high intake of red meat and processed meats such as bacon was linked to 8 percent of the deaths. And sugary drinks were a factor in 7.4 percent of the deaths.

We know, it may be tough to cut back on foods you love. Bacon is so alluring to many that it has even been called the 'gateway' to meat for vegetarians!

But, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. So, think of it this way: You can start consuming more of the foods that are protective.

For instance, the study found that low consumption of nuts and seeds was linked to about 9 percent of deaths.

In addition, diets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.

""The good news is that we now understand which foods we need to target to prevent Americans from dying prematurely from cardiometabolic diseases,"" says lead study author Renata Micha, a public health nutritionist and epidemiologist at the Friedman School at Tufts University.

In 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. ""This is a remarkable burden, nearly 1,000 deaths each day"" linked to dietary habits, says senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School at Tufts.

So, changing Americans dietary habits could have a significant impact, the authors argue. ""Our research suggests that nearly half of the risk can be reduced [by] eating a healthy diet,"" Mozaffarian says.

The new analysis is based on data from the federal survey known as NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers asked some 8,500 participants about their eating habits. In addition, Mozaffarian and his colleagues estimated associations of diet and disease from prior studies and clinical trials.

Now, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. Scientists use statistical methods to try to tease apart the impact of diet as part of people's overall lifestyle.

One challenge: People who have healthy diets often have other healthy habits, too — such as getting regular exercise. Dietary habits also track with socio-economic status. So, people with lower incomes are more likely to have poorer diets compared with wealthier people.

The Tufts researchers used studies that had controlled for these lifestyle factors, but it's not a perfect science.

""Relying on evidence from observational studies...carries the potential limitation of confounding bias,"" states an editorial that was published alongside the study. The editorial raises the possibility that the effect of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and physical activity could be substantial. ""For instance, it's possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern.""

Mozaffarian acknowledges the limitations. ""At the end of the day, our findings might modestly over - or under-estimate the health burdens,"" he told us.

He says the bigger point is this: ""Whether poor diet is causing 1,000 cardiovascular and diabetes deaths per day, or 500, it remains among the leading causes of preventable suffering.""

Poor diets are also linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don't separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.)

If you love foods that are associated with cardiovascular risks, you don't have to give them up entirely. As most nutrition studies show, it's excessive consumption that drives up the risk.

For instance, dietary guidelines recommend limiting sugar consumption to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. This means that a single 200-calorie sugary drink may be OK for a person who typically consumes a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet.

The problem: Most Americans consume much more.",Eating More — Or Less — Of 10 Foods May Cut Risk Of Early Death,4,NPR
story_reviews_00273,"Exercising by doing interval training, not weight lifting, could be the secret to staying young, according to a new study published Tuesday in the medical journal ""Cell Metabolism.""

High-intensity aerobic interval training--or exercising in bursts of moderate and high-intensity running, cycling, or other aerobic activity--may help to reduce the effects of aging at a cellular level, researchers found.

Scientists analyzed three groups of people who were exercising by doing high-intensity aerobic interval training, resistance training, or a combination of the two, over the course of a 12-week period.

While scientists found that all three types of exercise improved participants' lean body mass, at a cellular level, they found that the group participating in the high intensity interval training also saw improvements in the exercise capacity of their muscle's mitochondria. As people age, their mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy for your cells, become less efficient.

High intensity interval training essentially ""reversed"" many ""age-related differences"" in aspects of elderly participants' mitochondria, the researchers wrote in the study's summary.

Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, called the study's findings ""very interesting.""

""When they looked at the cellular level, the changes they saw in the older people’s cells with the high-intensity [training] made those cells look more like younger people’s cells in terms of how they handled energy,” Besser said today on ""Good Morning America."" “That was very interesting.”

Chris Powell, trainer and transformation specialist on ABC's “Extreme Weight Loss,"" said the term high-intensity interval training can be ""terrifying"" to people, but it should not be.

""High intensity interval training is just aerobic training with short bouts of weight training in between,"" Powell said today on ""GMA."" ""The beauty of it though is that we get to control the throttle of our own workouts.""

He continued, ""It doesn’t matter if you’re an elite athlete or you haven’t moved for 10 years...It’s all about completing, not competing.""

Besser advised people to consult with their medical doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen, including high-intensity interval training.

This training, also known as HIIT, can be done using just your own body weight and with minimal to no equipment, according to Powell.

Aerobic training can be accomplished by jump roping, running in place or doing jumping jacks or high knees, the trainer said. Weight training can be done with exercises such as push ups, lunges and back squats.

Powell demonstrated a HIIT workout of 20 high knees combined with 10 back lunges.

story_reviews_00274,"(Reuters Health) - When a migraine strikes, patients might one day be able to make the experience less painful by using a smartphone-controlled device to deliver mild electric shocks to their arm, a company-funded experiment suggests.

The experimental gadget, Nerivio Migra, is a patch with a battery, electrodes and a computer chip that can wirelessly communicate with mobile devices. It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.

“All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.

“We worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,” Yarnitsky added by email.

The study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.

Participants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what’s known as aura

Overall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.

Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.

For the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.

The four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.

When researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.

At the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.

The timing of treatment also mattered.

People who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.

Even though the study’s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.

The technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn’t involved in the current experiment.

One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.

“Rapid and sustained relief is what patients want,” Schoenen added.

If the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can’t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don’t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.

“The percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,” Schoenen cautioned.

story_reviews_00275,"Parents of children with autism take note. It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.

Infants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.

Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging — or MRI — to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.

On the left: MRI of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age 2. Note the decreased amount of CSF. UNC Health Care / UNC School of Medicine

This excess fluid “could possibly be an early biological marker for autism,” said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.

Such a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.

“The earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, ” said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.

The study results are “very exciting,” said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. “You can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.”

Shen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could “hamper brain development” and lead to autism, said Shen.

Completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.

Related: De Niro says 'find the truth on vaccines'. But scientists already did

Parents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.

“We wouldn’t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range” from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.

He and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain’s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.

“We’re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,” said Shen.

About 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.",Excess brain fluid may predict autism in high-risk babies,3,NBC News

Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR

If you drink more alcohol than you want to or should, you're not alone. A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.

Yet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.

""The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,"" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Part of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.

""I thought my only option was AA,"" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.

He's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker — a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought ""solace in the bottle,"" he says.

""I wanted to numb my thoughts,"" says John.

He'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.

He worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.

""She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,"" he recalls. ""Just absolutely furious.""

He went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.

""I would say John's story is not unique,"" DeSanto tells us. ""A lot of people are reluctant.""

Sometimes, traditional treatments — such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous — ""can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,"" she explains. ""There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.""

DeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.

""Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.

The analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.

So, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.

""It blunts the effects of alcohol,"" says Koob. ""People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.""

That was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. ""I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,"" he says. ""It was startling.""

It's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.

""This is helping me,"" John says. ""I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.""

According to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.

Many physicians are ""unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.

Any health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone — not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.

According to the NIAAA, ""patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.""

Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe.

story_reviews_00279,"Step inside the lounge at Evolved Science and you’ll find a cocktail menu unlike any you’ve ever seen.

The ritzy Manhattan medical office — which says it serves high-powered clients and celebrities — shakes and stirs up tailored IV infusions using a slurry of vitamins and amino acids. There’s a Jet Lag Eraser, for use after hopping off a long international flight, a Detoxification saline smoothie for “improving alertness and mental acuity,” and a Late Night Rescue cocktail to undo the effects of too many actual cocktails the night before.

The company claims liquid vitamins, minerals, and amino acids delivered straight to the bloodstream can protect users from getting a cold, boost athletic performance, “annihilate toxins,” and stave off headaches. “We put together the ideal combination for them to obtain the results they want: clearer skin, clearer mind, better hair, better nails,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, who runs the clinic.

And though the IV lends a medical air to the procedure, the infusions suffer from the same problem as many supplements taken orally — there isn’t any robust evidence to back up their health claims.

“Supplements don’t fix anything and they don’t prevent anything. It’s simple,” said Dr. Pete Miller, a clinician and nutrition researcher at Johns Hopkins.

The Evolved Science clinic in New York. Evolved Science

Vitamin IV infusions aren’t anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They’re part of a huge — and wildly popular — supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren’t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.

The infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers’ cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers’ cocktail — but it’s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.

The research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. The other — which was also missing a placebo group — involved just seven patients and showed only short-term improvement in symptoms.

Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe.

“We’re doing it in a sterile environment, it’s administered by a nurse, and everything is sterile,” she said. “The only difference is it’s kind of a beautiful environment.”

Customers at Evolved Science shell out anywhere from $325 to $875 for an infusion. For first-time clients, Schwartz recommends weekly injections for the first month or so, and then a routine infusion once a month. Patients kick back in cream-colored chairs together while they’re hooked up to IVs in the “infusion lounge.”

“It doesn’t look like a doctor’s office. It’s very relaxed, not like a spa. But like a private club. It’s a SoHo house kind of thing,” said Schwartz, a former trauma surgeon.

But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation?

“There is not not substantial evidence that vitamin supplements have a large impact on cognitive function,” said Dr. Francine Grodstein, a public health researcher at Harvard who has studied the subject. A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.

Still, the trend seems to be going strong. The I.V. Doc — an in-home vitamin infusion service — offers on-demand nutrient drips in places including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Hamptons. In Las Vegas, hangover buses deliver pick-me-up infusions on the go.

And despite a lack of sound evidence, experts expect consumers to keep coming back for infusions.

“What drives the market is not the science,” said Miller. “In spite of that lack of evidence, there’s still a market for it.”",Vitamin IVs make bold health promises. But where's the evidence?,5,STAT
story_reviews_00280,"WASHINGTON -- Bacteria live on everyone’s skin, and new research shows some friendly germs produce natural antibiotics that ward off their disease-causing cousins. Now scientists are mixing the good bugs into lotions in hopes of spreading protection.

In one early test, those customized creams guarded five patients with a kind of itchy eczema against risky bacteria that were gathering on their cracked skin, researchers reported Wednesday.

“It’s boosting the body’s overall immune defenses,” said Dr. Richard Gallo, dermatology chairman at the University of California, San Diego, who is leading the work.

End of the road for antibiotics?

We share our bodies with trillions of microbes that live on our skin, in our noses, in the gut. This community — what scientists call the microbiome — plays critical roles in whether we stay healthy or become more vulnerable to various diseases. Learning what makes a healthy microbiome is a huge field of research, and already scientists are altering gut bacteria to fight diarrhea-causing infections.



Wednesday’s research sheds new light on the skin’s microbiome — suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too.



“It’s a really important paper,” said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “It does open a window for a potential new treatment.”

Healthy skin harbors a different mix of bacteria than skin damaged by disorders such as atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. Those patches of dry, red, itchy skin are at increased risk of infections, particularly from a worrisome germ known as Staphylococcus aureus.

Gallo’s team took a closer look at how microbes in healthy skin might be keeping that bad staph in check.

They discovered certain strains of some protective bacteria secrete two “antimicrobial peptides,” a type of natural antibiotic. In lab tests and on the surface of animal skin, those substances could selectively kill Staph aureus, and even a drug-resistant strain known as MRSA, without killing neighboring bacteria like regular antibiotics do, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

But those good bugs are rare in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis, Gallo said.

“People with this type of eczema, for some reason that’s not quite known yet, have a lot of bacteria on the skin but it’s the wrong type of bacteria. They’re not producing the antimicrobials they need,” he explained.

Would replenishing the good bugs help? “They’re normal skin bacteria, so we knew they would be safe,” Gallo noted.

FDA fast-tracking ""unbelievable"" eczema drug

His team tested five volunteers with atopic dermatitis who had Staph aureus growing on their skin’s surface — what’s called colonization — but didn’t have an infection. Researchers culled some of the rare protective bacteria from the volunteers’ skin, grew a larger supply and mixed a dose into an over-the-counter moisturizer. Volunteers had the doctored lotion slathered onto one arm and regular moisturizer on the other.

A day later, much of the staph on the treated arms was killed — and in two cases, it was wiped out — compared to the untreated arms, Gallo said.

“We’re encouraged that we see the Staph aureus, which we know makes the disease worse, go away,” he said.

The study couldn’t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai’s Guttman-Yassky.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Feb. 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Stem cell transplants may halt the progression of aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in nearly half of those with the debilitating disease, but picking the right patients for the treatment is key, a new study suggests.

Specifically, younger patients with a relapsing form of MS who were not severely disabled and who hadn't found relief with other treatments fared better than others over five years, the international team of researchers found.

However, in some cases the treatment proved fatal, the researchers reported.

""Stem cell transplantation cannot be considered a cure for MS. However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,"" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.

Using patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.

In fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.

Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.

In effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.

Racke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.

""There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,"" he said. ""It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.""

A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.

More than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

MS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.

These symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.

Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.

To see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.

The researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.

Within 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.

The researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.

The report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.

Dr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He said, ""As neurologists battle with current therapies that are limited for progressive MS in younger patients, this study provides a possible new avenue for treatment.""

story_reviews_00283,"People with psoriasis who haven’t seen improvement with standard treatments now have a new option. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the injectable drug Siliq (broadalumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.

Because of an association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, Siliq will be sold with a “black box” warning and should be considered only for patients whose psoriasis has not responded—or has stopped responding—to phototherapy or to other systemic medicines taken orally or via injection.

Plaque psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes cells to build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick red patches and flaky silver-white scales. Current treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments (like corticosteroids) phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser) and systemic drugs—delivered via a pill, an injection or an IV infusion—that work throughout the body.

Siliq is unique because it binds to the receptor of a protein called interleukin-17, a known contributor to inflammation. By blocking the receptor from being activated, it keeps the body from receiving signals that can fuel inflammatory responses and psoriasis progression. Two other psoriasis drugs currently on the market work similarly, but instead bind to the protein itself.

This small difference is significant, says Dr. Richard Fried, a member of the National Psoriasis Foundation medical board, since responses to drug treatments can vary dramatically from person to person. “Having another agent in our armamentarium that works by a different mechanism is a welcome addition and may prove beneficial to many psoriasis suffers,” he says in an email. (Fried says he has no involvement with the drug or the drug company.)

In the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50% of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance—the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments—within a year. The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.

The drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.

Because of these events, the labeling for Siliq will include a Boxed Warning, and the drug will only be available through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.

A causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.

“Effective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,” says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.

Siliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients’ risk of infections and shouldn’t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or active tuberculosis infections. People should also avoid immunizations with live vaccines while being treated with Siliq.

“Patients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment,” said Dr. Julie Beitz, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an agency press release.

The drug’s recommended dosage schedule is an injection once a week for the first three weeks, followed by an injection every other week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Siliq’s manufacturer, says that pricing information is not available at this time, and expects to begin sales and marketing in the second half of 2017.

story_reviews_00284,"Yvonne Felix’s eyes don’t work well enough on their own for her to read, recognize faces or cross the street without help. But when the Toronto-based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera-equipped headgear, she looks at me like no one has before.

The visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer Star Trek fiction. Leaps in augmented-reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function, and then some.

Ms. Felix, who has Stargardt disease, wears a device from a company called eSight. The eSight 3—which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand-held remote—captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on OLED screens that sit very close to the eyes. Legally blind people like Ms. Felix have some limited vision, and eSight’s displays are tuned to make use of it. By dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in, it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure.

“Being able to see that people’s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing,” she says. The gear has allowed Ms. Felix to get a desk job and travel on her own. She’s also become a spokeswoman for eSight.

Efforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky TV-like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books. In the 1990s, NASA developed space goggles with a camera and two black-and-white cathode-ray-tube screens.

To Star Trek fans, this system recalls the blind “Next Generation” series character who wore a vision visor. “I remember thinking that Geordi La Forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out, I wanted to try it,” says Ms. Felix, who is 36.

The eSight visor, in development for 10 years, is reaching a level of maturity. The third-generation, which debuts this week, weighs less, has a wider field of view and just looks cooler. ESight—along with other makers of head-mounted low-vision aids such as Orcam and Nu-Eyes—is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.

The camera-equipped eSight 3, which weighs less than a quarter of a pound, uses VR-like displays to bring images close to the user's eyes. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal

When Ms. Felix allowed me to try on her visor, the images I saw were very high contrast, and the screens were positioned to allow me to also make use of my natural peripheral vision. The battery lasts about 6½ hours.

Using the hand-held controller, users can zoom and pan, like on a street sign, or plug in a TV feed directly. Because of those capabilities, Ms. Felix said in some cases eSight probably lets her see better than me.

“There is no device that’s a magic solution for all problems,” says Walter Wittich, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal’s School of Optometry, who is part of the first independent research project into the tech. Still, Mr. Wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification, for whom most current options are hand-held.

Not everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear. Mr. Wittich plans to release initial results from the study in May, and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with eSight immediately see a boost in quality of life. “It is working very well for some people already, and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability,” he says.

ESight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it. Their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for. They have sold about a thousand to date, and this new visor costs $10,000. While the device has FDA clearance as a Class I medical device, most insurance doesn’t cover it.

“That is a battle we are starting to wage,” says eSight Chief Executive Brian Mech. Some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab, he says, but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work.

The eSight 3 handheld controller lets the user zoom in or pan across signs and other objects. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal

“Yes, that is an expensive piece of equipment, but it can really do a lot for people,” says Gislin Dagnelie, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins and an adviser to the company. While the National Federation of the Blind estimates there are 1.3 million legally blind people living in the U.S., Mr. Dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from eSight’s tech.

For an artist like Ms. Felix, it has offered more than routine improvement. She worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint, because she felt her work as much as she saw it. Her favorite artist was Vincent van Gogh, because he also likely suffered from vision problems.

She recalls the first time she saw “Starry Night” with her eSight visor on, it made her cry. “I saw every little stroke. When I saw the color mixtures and how thick the paint was, it was the most overwhelming moment of my life,” she says. “I thought that never in my life would I be able to see something so beautiful.”

story_reviews_00285,"Cassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.

Instead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.

“It weakens the bacteria so the mouse’s own defenses work better” to clear the infection, she said. The plant extracts didn't harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.

The discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall.

AD

MRSA has become a serious threat to human health; in 2011, it was responsible for more than 80,000 invasive infections and more than 11,000 deaths in the United States, according to federal statistics.

AD

Antimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them. The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become “superbugs.”

“But instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,” said Quave.

Plants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said.

AD

AD

“People don’t save that knowledge over centuries” if something doesn’t work, she said. “We’re trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?”

The Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it’s sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed. The woody plant has long been a staple in Brazilian traditional medicine. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said.

Less is known about the plant’s fruit, which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers.

AD

From an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment.

AD

But she said the average person shouldn’t try to use the weed to make their own medicine. “Not everything that is natural is safe,” she said.

Her lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract. Researchers would still need to conduct pre-clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits.

story_reviews_00286,"“Bariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in health care,” says Laurie K. Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery’s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.

“I haven’t come across a patient yet who wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Twells said in an interview. “Most say they wish they’d done it 10 years sooner.” She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying — and failing — to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.

“These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,” Dr. Twells said. “The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,” often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.

In reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients’ health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.",Why Weight Loss Surgery Works When Diets Don’t,3,New York Times
story_reviews_00287,"(CNN) A new blood test may be as accurate as a test requiring a painful spinal tap for differentiating Parkinson's disease from similar disorders, according to a study published Wednesday in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that can cause tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, trouble balancing, problems walking and difficulty coordinating movement. Less obvious symptoms include depression, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and constipation.

Neurological disorders that mimic the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are called atypical parkinsonism disorders.

Many doctors cannot tell whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism.

""This can be very challenging, especially during the early stages of the diseases and if the responsible doctor is not a neurologist specialized in movement disorders,"" said Dr. Oskar Hansson, lead author of the new study, a neurologist and an associate professor at Lund University in Sweden.

Non-specialists ""do not really know exactly what questions to ask the patient and the special signs to look for,"" Hansson wrote in an email. Yet patients with atypical disorders ""usually have a much worse prognosis, with faster disease progression, (with) more disabling symptoms"" than Parkinson's patients, so early identification is crucial.

The correct diagnosis is also key to treatment since ""most patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders do not respond well to dopamine-targeting medications"" that are usually prescribed for Parkinson's patients, Hansson said.

Validating a new biomarker

Hansson and his colleagues developed a blood test that is, essentially, a variation on an existing test capable of detecting neurofilament light chain protein in spinal fluid. This protein is a component of nerve cells, and when these cells die, it can be detected in both spinal fluid and blood.

Because spinal fluid is not easily obtained by a primary care doctor, this diagnostic test is not very useful, so Hansson developed a blood test and investigated its accuracy in the new study.

When validating a new biomarker for disease, ""one should always analyze at least two different (groups of patients and controls) to make sure that the results are reproducible,"" said Hansson, who added that participants should also include both early- and late-stage patients established at different clinics.

All told, a total of 244 people with Parkinson's and 79 healthy volunteers serving as a comparison group participated in Hansson's study, along with 181 patients with atypical parkinsonism disorders.

Of these, 88 patients had multiple system atrophy, which impairs the body's involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion.

Seventy patients had progressive supranuclear palsy, which affects movement, walking, balance, speech, swallowing, vision, mood and thinking.

And 23 patients had corticobasal degeneration, which causes decreased movement on one side of the body, muscle rigidity, tremor and a disconnection between thought and action.

Testing these participants, the researchers found that nerve protein levels ranged higher in people with atypical parkinsonism and lower in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the healthy volunteers. However, the test cannot distinguish between the different atypical disorders, which doctors must rely on symptoms to diagnose.

Blood test accuracy is defined based on sensitivity, the percentage of positives that are correctly identified, and specificity, the percentage of negatives that are correctly identified. In Sweden, the blood test had a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 91%, while in the United Kingdom, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 90%. For early-stage study participants, generally, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 80%.

Overall, the blood test showed equal accuracy as the spinal fluid test when diagnosing Parkinson's or an atypical parkinsonism disorder, in both early and later stages of disease.

Hansson imagines that blood-based tests will be used in the future ""in the diagnostic work-up of patients with parkinsonism by most doctors who are not very specialized with these movement disorders."" He also believes the test will be used by specialists for Parkinson's patients who ""do not exhibit a very typical symptomatology"" or do not respond as expected to treatment.

Misdiagnosis is common

The prevalence of Parkinson's in the general population increases from about 1% at age 60 to 4% by age 80, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . ""Atypical parkinsonism disorders are not as common as Parkinson's disease,"" said Dr. Jeff Bronstein, a professor of neurology and director of movement disorders at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. He was not involved in the new study.

Usually, patients are first diagnosed with Parkinson's, and only later do their doctors discover that they have one of the more rare neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonism disorders, which are most likely to affect people in their 50s and 60s and represent approximately 10% to 20% of all cases originally diagnosed as Parkinson's

Though atypical parkinsonism conditions look very similar to Parkinson's at first, they ""have a different underlying molecular cause,"" according to Bronstein, and so it is important to recognize them early in order to treat them properly. ""Disease-specific therapies are now in trials, so accurate diagnosis is essential in determining if these new treatments work,"" he said.

According to Dr. Paul Wright, chairman of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, the importance of this study is that it brings to light that there are new biomarker tests that can delineate between these neurological diseases.

""A lot of time, people come in and say they or a family member has a tremor, and they believe it's Parkinson's disease,"" said Wright, who also was not involved in the study. This early assumption may impede diagnosis of a less recognized atypical parkinsonism condition.

Or a patient has ""horrible blood pressure fluctuations,"" Wright said, and no obvious tremor or rigidity symptoms, so a doctor suspects a heart condition. Instead, the cause is multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. Though other symptoms will show up eventually and help in diagnosing the patient, in the meantime, the patient will be receiving the wrong medicines.

An accurate blood test, then, would be good news in these situations.

""It's a lot more reassuring to a patient to say 'we're just going to take a blood test to check for a few things,' "" Wright said. ""It's much easier and less anxiety-provoking for patients than taking a spinal tap.""

Up until now, many diseases have been diagnosed based on symptoms, with patients asking, ""How do you know I have this?"" Meanwhile, doctors are not always correct, Wright said. This is true even of Parkinson's, which is diagnosed based on symptoms, a patient's history, neurological exams, a patient's response to medicine and, in some cases, brain imaging tests.

Still, Wright is hopeful and believes a biomarker test for Parkinson's ""will be down the line. ... In general, researchers are looking for biomarkers of disease.""

Specialists and sub-specialists are available only in big cities, Wright said, and access to a simple blood test would enable a correct diagnosis in a primary care office.

story_reviews_00288,"An app called Natural Cycles has become the first to be classified as a medical device for use as contraception.



Natural Cycles uses a woman's body temperature and menstrual cycle data to tell her when she is fertile. On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by Tüv Süd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.

But sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.

Natural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.



Natural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.

""The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,"" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.



Taking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control.

You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you’re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.

But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.

And if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.

""You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,"" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. ""It's not a method that's going to suit everybody.""

But for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.

""When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,"" said Berglund.

""Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.""



To use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.



The app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a ""red day"" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.","This App Says It's As Good As The Pill At Preventing Pregnancy, But Experts Want More Evidence",5,BuzzFeed

Would a life without onions, garlic, apples and most bread be worth living?

For growing numbers of people suffering from digestive ills, the answer is ""yes,"" at least for a while.

They are trying something called the low-FODMAP diet, an experimental eating plan developed in Australia and now getting some scientific backing and commercial buzz in the United States. The diet is aimed primarily at people with irritable bowel syndrome, a common condition in which abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits — with diarrhea, constipation or both — can wax and wane for years.

Followers are asked to eliminate, and then try to reintroduce, a long list of foods containing certain carbohydrates that might trigger gas, bloating, pain and diarrhea. FODMAP is an acronym for those carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.

The theory is that FODMAPs, found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy foods and sweeteners, are poorly digested by susceptible people. The undigested carbohydrates can draw extra fluid into the digestive tract and end up in the colon, where they are “feasted upon” and fermented by gut microbes, leading to all sorts of misery, says Lauren Van Dam, a registered dietitian at the University of Michigan.

If giving up some foods might lessen that misery, many people are game, she says. “We have some patients that are literally housebound because they are worried they are going to have an accident or because they have terrible pain,” Van Dam says.

Barbara DeLancey, a 63-year-old registered nurse from Ann Arbor, says she was crippled by 10-times-a-day diarrhea when she agreed to try the diet a year ago. “I was resistant at first because it seemed so restrictive,” she says. She got teary-eyed at the grocery store, seeing all the food she could not have.

But eventually she learned she could tolerate and add back some favorites, including garlic and apples. She credits the diet, along with medication, with a big reduction in her symptoms, but says “it has not been a miracle cure.”

The diet has generated enough interest to prompt some food companies to introduce low-FODMAP products — hoping for a market surpassing that for gluten-free foods, according to some industry reports.

In 2014, IBS treatment guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology said the diet showed promise, but that the quality of evidence was “very low.""

Since then, several studies have strengthened the case for the diet, says guideline co-author Brian Lacy, a professor of medicine and chief of gastroenterology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, N.H. Still, one study from Sweden showed no advantage over a less-restrictive dietary approach that eliminates fewer foods and stresses changes such as smaller, more frequent meals.

""The data are not overwhelming,” Lacy says. “But I think it’s a reasonable thing to try.”

The largest study so far, with 92 patients, was conducted at University of Michigan. It found that 52% of low-FODMAP patients and 41% of patients on a less-restrictive diet reported “adequate relief.” The difference was not statistically significant, says study co-author William Chey, a professor of gastroenterology. But low-FODMAP patients did get significantly better relief from pain and bloating and greater gains in mood, body image and overall quality of life, he says.

Medications, probiotics, fiber supplements and other approaches still have roles in treating IBS, and no one approach works for all patients, Chey and Lacy say.

It’s not known if the diet leads to any nutritional deficiencies or keeps working in the long run — especially for patients who get little support from doctors or dietitians.

“Physicians are largely administering the diet by giving patients sheets of paper with foods to exclude,” Chey says. Ideally, all would be referred to dietitians, Chey and Lacy agree. But few dietitians are trained in the diet, and insurers typically do not cover the visits, Lacy notes.

When patients do make their way to Kate Scarlata, a Boston area registered dietitian who specializes in the diet, the first thing she tells them is that it “is a dietary experiment. It’s a short-term learning diet.”

Van Dam does the same — explaining that after a few weeks she will help clients reintroduce foods one carbohydrate category at a time.

“Most are able to identify some high-FODMAP foods they can tolerate very well and some they can tolerate a little, but not in high portions every day,” she says. “Our goal is for them to be on the most varied, nutritious diet possible.”

The trickiest part is avoiding onions and garlic, the dietitians say. They teach clients strategies such as using (safe) garlic-infused oils, avoiding restaurant sauces and soups and topping salads with oil and vinegar.

Mapping FODMAP

High- and low-FODMAP food lists are updated frequently at websites and apps run by the University of Michigan and Monash University in Australia.

Here is a sampling from the Michigan site. (Note: the site receives funding from Nestle Health Science, which is marketing low-FODMAP products).

story_reviews_00290,"Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones.

The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a long-running study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients.

After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.

The study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.",Hormone Blockers Can Prolong Life if Prostate Cancer Recurs,4,New York Times
story_reviews_00291,"A commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice.

The drug, a type of androgen-depleting therapy, is a frontline treatment for men who opt not to have surgery for the cancer. But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns.

Androgens, including testosterone, are thought to contribute to the growth and development of prostate cancer. Among men whose cancer showed signs of coming back after their prostate was surgically removed, adding a drug that blocks androgen receptors to radiation treatments halved their death rate from prostate cancer over the subsequent 12 years.

The findings should trickle down to clinical settings “pretty quickly,” said Dr. William Shipley, chair of the genitourinary oncology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the researchers behind the study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Prostate cancer recurrence happens in about 30 percent of patients after surgery. In these cases, radiation therapy is usually used.

The specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The effect of the newer-generation medications, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, is similar to bicalutamide, according to other trials.

AstraZeneca (AZN), which is one of the makers of bicalutamide, was a sponsor of the study, and one of Shipley’s coauthors has received honoraria and grants from the company.

Because prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly, the study — which ran from 1998 to 2003 — needed an extended follow-up period to be sure of the effects, Shipley said. The men in the trial received the ADT drugs for two years.

The study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It really builds on some prior data and combines prior findings to ask and answer a new question that is quite relevant for men affected by prostate cancer.”

Some patients benefitted from adding the drugs more than others. The results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels above .07 ng/ml when they started the trial. (While that is a relatively low level for most men, PSA levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy.) Men with medium-grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug.

However, See and Shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do, which limits the statistical power of those conclusions. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.

“You don’t want to treat a patient if he doesn’t need to be treated,” Shipley said.",Old drug gets new trick for prostate cancer treatment,3,STAT
story_reviews_00292,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its potent cholesterol fighter Repatha significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with heart disease, according to initial results of a large, eagerly-anticipated trial released on Thursday. The data should pave the way for greater acceptance by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting about 75 percent of prescriptions written for the expensive medicine despite multiple appeals by physicians.

No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. It also said Repatha’s effect on mental function was similar to placebo, likely alleviating concerns that it might impair cognition in some patients.

The trial was widely expected to be positive, especially after a smaller study presented in November showed Repatha therapy led to regression of artery-clogging plaque, an underlying cause of heart disease.

“These results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.

Details on the magnitude of benefit will be revealed in mid-March at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, D.C. Industry analysts have been looking for a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events.

Repatha, with a list price of more than $14,000 a year, was approved based on its ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in patients who require more intensive therapy on top of widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or who are unable to tolerate statins.

But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine.

Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Corp and Sanofi have had endured anemic sales as a result.

Amgen reported just $40 million in third-quarter sales. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled.

The primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. At the heart meeting in March, researchers will also provide details on risk reduction for each of the components, such as non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death.

TUESDAY, Jan. 31, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A breath test to detect stomach and esophageal cancers shows promise, researchers say.

The test measures five chemicals in the breath. It was 85 percent accurate in detecting these cancers in more than 300 patients, the new study found.

Each year, 1.4 million cases of cancer of the stomach and esophagus (the tube leading from the throat to the stomach) are diagnosed worldwide. Both tend to be diagnosed at a late stage and the five-year survival rate for the two cancers is 15 percent, the researchers said.

Findings from the study were presented Monday at the European Cancer Congress (ECC).

""At present the only way to diagnose esophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications,"" study author Dr. Sheraz Markar said in an ECC news release. Markar is from Imperial College London in England.

With endoscopy, a flexible tube is threaded down a sedated patient's throat to the stomach to view the digestive tract.

""A breath test could be used as a noninvasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival,"" Markar said.

""Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the esophagus and stomach, and which do not,"" he explained.

Markar added that the test needs to be validated in a bigger group before it could be used on patients. The researchers said they are planning a larger trial of the breath test over the next three years.

Study results presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00294,"(Reuters Health) - Complementary and alternative medicine options may help men manage premature ejaculation, according to a new review of existing research.

The improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine.

“There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK.

“It’s important to evaluate the evidence for other therapies,” she told Reuters Health by email. “To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess complementary and alternative medicine for premature ejaculation.”

According to the International Society for Sexual Medicine, premature ejaculation can be a lifelong problem, and this primary form of the problem is usually defined as ejaculation happening within one minute of initiating vaginal intercourse every time a man has ever had sex. A man’s “latency time” can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.

In the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical “severance secret” cream.

Together, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.

Chinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.

In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.

“There are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,” said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.”

The prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men’s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.

“Although it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,” said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.

The main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.

In addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it’s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.

Some studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.

“Nowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn’t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,” Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. “After all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.”

story_reviews_00295,"A small study claims children with autism may benefit from fecal transplants, which involves introducing donated microbes into people with gastrointestinal disease to rebalance the gut. The Ohio State University, Northern Arizona University and Arizona State University researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress, and improvements to both after fecal transplant.

“Transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems,” lead study author Ann Gregory, a microbiology graduate student at The Ohio state University, said in a news release. “And, with autism, gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe, so we thought this could be potentially valuable.

The researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall. The research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life.

The study, which was published in the journal Microbiome, included 18 children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. The children ranged from 7 to 16 years old. A questionnaire was used to assess social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication. Parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment. Children without autism were used as a control for the study, the news release reported.

On average, the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped 82 percent from the beginning to the end of treatment, while average developmental age increased by 1.4 years, according to the release. Researchers also asked the children’s doctors to perform pre- and post-diagnostic evaluations, which suggested lasting benefits.

One of the study’s limitations is its small size, and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home.

“We have to be mindful of the placebo effect, and we have to take [the findings] with a grain of salt,” Matthew Sullivan, an associate professor of microbiology at The Ohio State University, said in the release. “But it does give us hope.”","Fecal transplants may help children with autism, researchers claim",2,Fox News

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Just how successful is the procedure called catheter ablation at fixing irregular heartbeats that can be potentially fatal?

Pretty successful, a new study found, but there are caveats.

Burning or freezing specific areas of the heart can alleviate the common irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation in 74 percent of patients. However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.

About 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.

For those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.

""Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,"" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.

But the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.

Complications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.

In addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.

During the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.

The burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.

According to Dr. Hugh Calkins, ""Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results."" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

The complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.

""Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,"" Calkins said. ""For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,"" he added.

The new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.

Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.

According to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.

Atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.

About 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.

After the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.

The study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.

Dr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, ""Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.""

In certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.

""Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,"" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.

""Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,"" he suggested.

Catheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.

The report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.

When Ali Andrew Li was born on Jan. 7, he was gently placed on his mother's chest, where doctors cleaned and examined him and covered him with a warm blanket.

""I just loved it,"" his mother, Salma Shabaik, a family physician who lives in Los Angeles, says. ""It was really nice to have the baby right there beneath my eyes where I could feel him, touch him, kiss him.""

That was different than the birth of her son Elias two years ago; he was whisked away to a bassinet to be examined. And unlike Elias, who cried a lot after delivery, Shabaik says Ali stopped crying ""within seconds"" after being placed on her chest.

Kangaroo mother care has been widely used worldwide to care for premature babies, and it's gaining popularity in caring for healthy full term babies like Ali as well. It is as it sounds: Like a kangaroo's pouch, mothers hold their naked newborns on their bare chest for the first few hours of life.

At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born, the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns. The baby gets to know their mother immediately, says Dr. Larry Gray, behavioral and developmental pediatrician at Comer Children's Hospital, University of Chicago Medicine. ""The baby gets landed in a trusting environment,"" he says, reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be ""soft, comfortable and warm.""

The benefits are many, according to Dr. Lydia Kyung-Min Lee, an ob-gyn at UCLA. Not only is the baby happier, she says, but his or her vitals are more stable. Body temperature, heart and breathing rate normalize more quickly. The close contact also allows the baby to be exposed to the same bacteria as the mother, which can protect against allergies and infection in the future. Infants who receive kangaroo care breast feed more easily, Lee says, and their mothers tend to breast feed for longer periods of time, which is ""all good.""

Babies also seem to suffer less pain. Almost 20 years ago, Gray studied how babies respond to a heel prick to draw blood, a procedure that screens newborns for genetic disorders. He found that when healthy newborns had kangaroo care, there was less facial grimacing and crying suggesting pain, compared to babies who had been swaddled and had the procedure in their bassinets, ""sort of alone.""

One of the first places to show how this technique can help preemies was Colombia in the 1990s. There, hospitals with no access to incubators and other equipment often sent home preemies with no expectation that they would live. But doctors were surprised to see that babies whose mothers carried them close, skin to skin, not only survived but thrived.

This was a ""serendipitous magical finding,"" says Gray, suggesting that skin-to-skin contact acted something like a ""natural incubator.""

Gray also points to the work of Myron Hofer, a psychiatrist with Columbia University Medical Center who studies attachment between mother and infants. Hofer coined the term ""hidden regulators"" that pass between mother and baby. It's not just that mother and baby are together, Gray says, but also that the mother is in some way ""programming the baby, the breathing, temperature and heart rate.""

That ""magic"" can also happen between baby and father, too, says Gray, if there's skin-to-skin contact. And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated, Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin.

TUESDAY, Jan. 17, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Because of stringent tonsillectomy guidelines, some kids who could benefit from tonsil removal surgery aren't getting it, two new reviews suggest.

To qualify for the surgery, a child must have many recurring throat infections within a short span of time or severe sleep disturbances, said Dr. Sivakumar Chinnadurai, a co-author of the reviews.

An evaluation of current medical evidence suggests more kids would receive significant short-term improvement in their daily life if the guidelines were relaxed, said Chinnadurai, a pediatric otolaryngologist with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

Children experienced nearly half as many sore throats when they underwent a tonsillectomy, even if they didn't meet the guidelines, Chinnadurai and his colleagues found. The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.

However, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.

""The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,"" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.

There's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.

""In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,"" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.

The medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.

Tonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.

Thirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.

Swollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.

Guidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.

The researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.

There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.

The study results showed ""there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,"" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.

""In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,"" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.

""If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,"" Hackett said. ""But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery."" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)

Still, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.

About 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.

""Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,"" Chinnadurai said.

""We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,"" Hackett said. ""We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That's not what this study says at all.""

The two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.

story_reviews_00300,"Like spicy foods? If so, science has some good news for you: Eating hot chili peppers may help you live longer.

A new study, published in PLoS ONE, found that consumption of hot red chili peppers was associated with a 13 percent lower risk of death.

The research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life.

For the study, researchers at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont analyzed data on more than 16,000 Americans using the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants were followed for an average of 18.9 years.

The researchers note that people who ate hot red chili peppers tended to be “younger, male, white, Mexican-American, married, and to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and consume more vegetables and meats . . . had lower HDL-cholesterol, lower income, and less education,” in comparison to participants who did not consume red chili peppers.

Though the mechanism by which chili peppers could help delay death is not well understood, there are some theories.

Previous, mostly experimental research has suggested that spices and their bioactive ingredient, capsaicin, have anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties.

The authors say capsaicin also possesses antimicrobial properties that “may indirectly affect the host by altering the gut microbiota.”

The research corroborates a 2015 study conducted in China and published in the BMJ that found regular consumption of spicy food is associated with a lower risk of death.

But experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. People with gastrointestinal issues, for example, should hold off on the hot sauce.

“For those who are affected by digestive disorders such as a stomach ulcer, I would be cautious about eating spicy foods,” Lu Qi, of Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and lead author of The BMJ study, told CBS News.

The authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes.

“Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write.",Good news for people who love spicy food,3,CBS News
story_reviews_00301,"To the age-old question “Is coffee bad for you?”, researchers are in more agreement than ever that the answer is a resounding “no.” A new study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that older people with low levels of inflammation — which drives many, if not most, major diseases — had something surprising in common: they were all caffeine drinkers.

“The more caffeine people consumed, the more protected they were against a chronic state of inflammation,” says study author David Furman, consulting associate professor at the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford University. “There was no boundary, apparently.”

In the study, Furman and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from 100 young and old people. The older people tended to have more activity in several inflammation-related genes compared with the younger group — no surprise, since as people get older, inflammation throughout the body tends to rise. Chronic diseases of aging, like diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, cancer, joint disorders and Alzheimer’s, are all believed to have inflammation in common. “Most of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging, per se, but rather diseases of inflammation,” Furman says. The more active these genes were, the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.

What’s more, even among older people, those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation — and they had something else in common too. They all drank caffeine regularly. People who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway. Caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off, the researchers say.

The goal isn’t to make every trace of inflammation disappear, the scientists stress. In fact, inflammation is an important function of the immune system, which uses it to fight off infections and remove potentially toxic compounds. But with aging, the process isn’t regulated as well as it is in a younger body. “Clearly in aging something is breaking down, and we become less effective at managing this inflammation,” says Mark Davis, director of the Stanford institute. “But now in this paper, we identify a particular pathway that was not associated with inflammation before. We are able to point, with a much higher resolution picture, at aging and the things that should be markers for inflammation.”

The key will be to figure out when the inflammatory response starts to spiral out of control. In an upcoming study, Furman and others will soon investigate the immune systems of 1,000 people; he hopes to use that information to develop a reference range of immune-system components to tell people whether their levels are normal, or if they’re at higher risk for developing chronic conditions driven by inflammation.

In the meantime, following the example of caffeine-drinking adults with lower levels of inflammation — by having a cup of joe or two — might be a good idea.

story_reviews_00302,"Risk of early death is as low for those who meet recommended activity targets in one or two sessions a week as it is for daily exercisers, study shows

People who cram all their exercise into one or two sessions at the weekend benefit nearly as much as those who work out more frequently, researchers say.



A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that “weekend warriors” lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week.



The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit.



Health racket: tennis reduces risk of death at any age, study suggests Read more

“Millions of people enjoy doing sport once or twice a week, but they may be concerned that they are not doing enough,” said Gary O’Donovan, a physical activity researcher and author on the study at Loughborough University. “We find a clear benefit. It’s making them fit and healthy.”



The UK’s National Health Service recommends that to ward off an early death, people should spend 150 minutes a week performing moderate exercise, or 75 minutes a week doing vigorous exercise. As a rule of thumb, moderate exercise can be done while maintaining a conversation, whereas during vigorous exercise talking at the same time is too hard.



In the study, those who met the physical activity target by exercising through the week had a 35% lower risk of death than the inactive adults, with cardiovascular deaths down 41% and a 21% lower risk of cancer death.



But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Their overall risk of death was 30% lower than the sedentary adults, with the risk of cardiovascular and cancer deaths lower by 40% and 18% respectively.

“Weekend warriors are people who meet the recommended volume of physical activity each week through only one or two sessions. There are doing a large proportion of vigorous exercise and that makes you fitter than moderate exercise,” said O’Donovan. Men and women benefited equally, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine.



The results are based on medical data gathered for 63,591 adults aged 40 and above between 1994 and 2012. Nearly 9,000 of the study participants died in the period.



For those who have resolved to get fit in the New Year, O’Donovan recommends to start with moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, and then to set realistic, incremental goals to boost confidence without running the risk of setbacks due to injury. “A middle aged or older person should do as much as 12 weeks of moderate exercise before introducing vigorous exercise,” he said.



Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. In the study, those who exercised a little had a 29% lower risk of death than those who did no exercise at all. “The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,” Ekelund said.



“My take home message is that the greatest risk reduction and the greatest gain for the individual and for public health is if those who are physically inactive take up some activity,” he added.

A paper published January 9 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests these warriors may be onto something. In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend.

“I think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,” says Gary O’Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England’s Loughborough University and lead author of the paper.

O’Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records.

They found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations.

However, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it’s likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn’t count as a workout.

It’s recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) “In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,” says O’Donovan.

This study shows that it doesn’t matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it.

However, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn’t exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.

There are risks that come with a weekend warrior exercise schedule, especially for people who aren’t used to being active. “I would be more concerned about what’s happening at the point of exercise—not the long-term benefits,” says Dr. Howard Andrew Selinger, chair of family medicine at Quinnipiac University. He says someone who is not in good shape is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest or acute injury, such as spraining muscles or putting too much stress on joints.

O’Donovan encourages aspiring weekend warriors to start slowly to avoid any health problems. He says middle-aged adults should exercise moderately during the first 12 weeks and then slowly build up to more vigorous activity.",‘Weekend Warrior’ Workouts are Beneficial as Just 20 Minutes of Exercise a Day,4,Newsweek
story_reviews_00304,"(Reuters Health) - Cardiac arrest patients who get cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from a bystander at the scene may have better survival odds even when an ambulance takes a long time to arrive, a Danish study suggests.

Researchers examined data on 7,623 cardiac arrest patients and found when an ambulance arrived within five minutes of a 911 call, patients were 2.3 times more likely to survive at least 30 days if they received bystander CPR than if they didn’t get this aid at the scene.

When ambulances took up to 10 minutes to arrive, bystander CPR was associated with tripled survival odds, the study also found. After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful.

“Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.

Cardiac arrest involves the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal.

Chest compressions or CPR can help restore circulation, increasing the odds of survival. Bystander CPR generally won’t restore a normal heart rhythm but it can buy time by maintaining blood flow to vital organs.

“We know from previous research that 1 in 8 people survive after a cardiac arrest if a bystander initiates CPR before the arrival of the emergency medical services,” Rajan said by email. “In contrast, if CPR is not initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services, only 1 in 30 people survive a cardiac arrest.”

For the current study, researchers looked at 30-day survival for patients who had cardiac arrests outside of a hospital between 2005 and 2011.

When the ambulance arrived within five minutes, 14.5 percent of patients in the bystander CPR group survived at least 30 days, compared with 6.3 percent in the group that didn’t get this help.

For ambulance arrival times up to ten minutes, 6.7 percent in the CPR group and 2.2 percent of the other patients survived. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful.

The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note.

“Once a victim has sustained a cardiac arrest with little or no blood supply going to the heart or brain, the time to reestablishing blood flow with oxygenated blood is critical,” said Dr. Lenworth Jacobs, director of trauma and emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut.

“It is generally thought that the sooner this is implemented the better,” Jacobs, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.

The biggest obstacle to bystander CPR remains that too few people know how to do it, said Dr. Peter Pons, an emergency physician in Denver and professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

“Clearly, if someone has been motivated to learn and has been taught CPR, they will often assist,” Pons, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”

story_reviews_00305,"On a scale of 1 to 10, lower back pain can register somewhere between ""I need an aspirin"" to “please jack me up with morphine.”

Those suffering from such discomfort might feel moderate to mild pain that is not debilitating. In severe cases, they could feel like a giant electrified claw has claimed the lower part of their back, tearing into each nerve in that part of the body. The smallest of movements – getting up from a chair, walking or even coughing – can feel torturous. Maybe the lower back is as stiff as hardened concrete and as sensitive as an exposed nerve.

A simple lumbar support device, or back brace, can provide short-term relief, research shows, according to an analysis of 28 studies published in the September 2016 issue of the Annals of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine journal. While these devices won’t cure the underlying condition, they're simple and relatively inexpensive. In the 2016 meta-analysis, researchers concluded that lumbar support devices are useful for improving function and reducing pain among those suffering from subacute back pain, which means it's past the acute stage – which is sudden and short in duration – but not long-lasting enough to be chronic.

“Lumbar support devices provide enough compression and support for the lower back to allow healing to occur,” says Christopher Cousins, a physical therapist based in the District of Columbia. “The compression on the abdomen means there’s less pressure on your lower back discs, ligaments, muscles and spine.”

Lumbar devices typically fit around your waist and are secured with Velcro. They often have a steel or plastic plate attached to the section that would press against the patient’s lower back to provide support; some have over-the-shoulders straps. Most over-the-counter lumbar support devices cost between $25 and $130, and they're available at many drug stores, Target and Wal-Mart, plus online without a a prescription. Custom-made lumbar support devices, which are contoured to the natural curvature of the patient’s spine, cost from a few hundred dollars to about $1,000, Cousins says.

People who suffer mild to moderate subacute back pain should put on a back brace as soon as their discomfort sets in, says Scott Bautch, a chiropractor in Wasau, Wisconsin, and president of the American Chiropractic Association's council on occupational health. ""You want to give yourself bracing so you can move,"" Bautch says. ""Inactivity or immobilization is the worst thing for a back. You want to remain active, and a brace can help you do that.""

Some studies have shown that wearing a lumbar support device could lead to negative effects, such as skin lesions, muscle wasting, gastrointestinal disorders, higher blood pressure and higher heart rates. Those issues are rare and typically occur with people who wear a back brace for an extended period of time, for more than the week or two most experts recommend, Bautch says. If a back brace fits well, is worn properly – that is, it's not too snug – and is not overused, it shouldn't create any health problems, Bautch says. During the course of his 30-year career, Bautch says, hundreds of his patients have worn lumbar support devices. None of them developed any problems, aside from a handful who had minor skin irritation where part of the brace rubbed their body, Bautch says. He remedied that issue by having his patients wear an undershirt between the lumbar support device and their skin.

Searing, subacute back pain is caused by an array of conditions, including a herniated disc, in which the soft, jelly-like center inside the disc pushes out through a tear in its tough exterior and irritates nerves. A herniated disc can cause sciatica, a painful condition that affects the back, hips and legs and is caused by the compression of a spinal nerve root in the lower back. Spinal discs degenerate with age, and a herniated disc can occur without a physical injury, says Dr. Neel Anand, director of spine trauma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""Think of your disc like your car tire – it's going to wear out,"" Anand says.

Before getting a lumbar support device for your lower back pain, experts recommend these steps:

1. If you have severe pain, see a physician quickly. If your back pain or stiffness is so bad you can't move without tremendous discomfort, see a doctor as soon as possible, Bautch says. If your pain and stiffness are that severe, a back brace may not be of much immediate use, he says, adding that it may be helpful once the pain and stiffness subside to a tolerable level where you can move.

Moderate to mild lower back pain often subsides after five days or so, but if your discomfort persists beyond that or worsens, see a doctor, adds Dr. Megan Cortazzo, medical director of clinical documentation improvement and health information management at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A doctor can test for and rule out serious potential causes, such as kidney stones, an abdominal aneurysm and cancer, Cortazzo says. Doctors can order an array of tests, such as an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, to arrive at the correct diagnosis, which will help lead to the most effective treatment plan, she says. The goal of most treatment regimens is strengthening the patient's core muscles supporting the spine so the pain doesn't recur. Treatment could include physical therapy, a stretching routine, yoga or Pilates. Many people also find chiropractic adjustments helpful, says Robert Hayden, a chiropractor based in Griffin, Georgia.

2. Find a lumbar support device that fits you. Once you've been diagnosed, look for a lumbar support device that fits the natural curvature of your spine, says Dr. Jeremy Smith, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, California. Try on a few at the store before buying one, he advises. If you buy the device online, you can return it if it doesn't fit. “It needs to naturally contour and fit, kind of like a glove, so all surface areas are in contact with your back. It should help remind you to keep good posture,” Smith says. “The device should be snug, but not too tight. It shouldn’t constrict your breathing.”

3. Don’t become reliant on your back brace. Patients should wear a back brace for no longer than a few days to two weeks at the most, Bautch says. “Longer than that, and your muscles start to adapt and get accustomed to the brace, which means they can lose strength, which can lead to more injuries,” he adds. “If you use the back brace for more than two weeks, you can become brace-dependent.” A lumbar support device can be useful in the short term, but strengthening the core muscles that support your back is important in the long run, Bautch says.

4. Learn your capacity. Figure out your physical limits to avoid reinjuring your back – both when you're wearing a back brace and after you've stopped using it, says Robert Shapiro, a physical therapist and certified orthopedic manual therapist based in Huntington, New York. ""You're not Superman when you're wearing your brace,"" he says. Exceeding your physical boundaries could cause a recurrence of low back pain. “You have to learn what your limits are and not to exceed them,” Shapiro says. “You may be able to lift a box of books, but shoveling snow may cause pain. Your physical limits may change as you exercise and strengthen your core.”",Can Lumbar Support Devices Relieve Lower Back Pain?,3,U.S. News & World Report
story_reviews_00306,"Researchers used CAR-T to treat a man with brain cancer to some success

Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest cancers — an illness that responds to few treatment options, and often poorly. But a single case study that uses an experimental immunotherapy to treat these brain tumors might give oncologists a new way to approach the disease.

The therapy, called CAR-T, is controversial and has faced hurdles in clinical trials. It has shown great promise in treating blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma — but has proven challenging in treating other forms of the disease, including solid tumors.",CAR-T therapy makes early inroads in treating brain cancer,4,STAT
story_reviews_00307,"Using the immune system to beat cancer is quickly becoming a promising new strategy for battling tumors. But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it’s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.

But in a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.

The 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.

Other smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.

If the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. “If we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,” says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.

The patient is one of nine in the trial, and so far, many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy. Based on this man’s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer.

It’s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it’s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected. It’s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein, so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive.

Badie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins. Eventually, these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient’s cancer — a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer. These results are the first encouraging sign that the immunotherapy that is helping more people with blood cancer might also be effective for people with solid tumors like brain cancers.

The incidence has more than doubled in developed countries in recent decades. More than six million children in the United States have asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as do more than 330 million children and adults worldwide, according to the Global Asthma Network.

Dr. Bisgaard said it was not possible to tell from the study whether pregnant women could benefit from simply eating more fish. Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their consumption of certain types of fish like swordfish and tuna because they contain mercury. But many other types are considered safe, especially smaller fish like sardines that are not at the top of the food chain and therefore not likely to accumulate mercury and other contaminants from eating other fish.

The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists bought fish oil from a company that makes it, but they said the company had no role in the study. The research was paid for by the Danish government and private foundations.

An editorial in the same journal by an expert who was not part of the study praised the research, saying it was well designed and carefully performed. The author of that editorial, Dr. Christopher E.

TUESDAY, Dec. 27, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Heart failure patients have weakened hearts, but researchers say an experimental drug used for the first time in humans may repair heart cells and improve heart function.

According to the results of a small phase 1 trial, a single intravenous infusion of the drug cimaglermin was safe and, at high doses, improved heart function for at least three months.

""Right now we have many therapies that we use for heart failure, and these patients [in the study] were on all of those therapies and still had significant heart dysfunction,"" said lead researcher Dr. Daniel Lenihan. He's a professor of medicine and director of Vanderbilt University's heart clinical research program in Nashville.

People with heart failure often take a combination of drugs, Lenihan said. These include medications to lower blood pressure and diuretics to help remove excess fluid that builds up as a result of the heart's labored pumping ability. In addition, some people have implanted defibrillators or pacemakers.

Even with all these options, the death rate among these patients is ""unacceptably high,"" Lenihan said.

Heart failure, a condition where the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, is among the leading causes of death worldwide. A significant number of heart failure patients don't respond well to current treatments, particularly those patients whose left lower heart chamber, which pumps blood into the arteries, is weak, Lenihan said.

Cimaglermin acts as a growth factor for the heart, helping it repair itself following injury, Lenihan said. Specifically, it binds to the HER2 and HER4 receptors on the surface of heart cells that are important for cellular repair and survival, he explained.

Researchers have tried using stem cells to repair heart muscle in much the same way, he said, but these efforts have not been effective. ""You don't see any sustained effect,"" he added.

A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.

""This drug, although still in an experimental phase, might be an important way to improve heart function in patients with heart failure,"" he said.

For the study, Lenihan and his colleagues randomly assigned 40 patients to get an infusion of cimaglermin or a placebo.

Compared with patients who received a placebo, patients given a high dose of cimaglermin had a sustained increase in the heart's ability to pump blood. The improvement lasted 90 days, with the maximum increase in heart function reached in 28 days, the researchers found.

The most common side effects were headache and nausea directly after receiving the drug. One patient who received the highest dose of cimaglermin developed abnormal liver function, which cleared up over a two-week period, Lenihan said.

The study was funded by Acorda Therapeutics, the maker of cimaglermin, and the report was published online Dec. 26 in the journal JACC: Basic to Translational Science.

Dr. Nanette Bishopric is a professor of medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the author of an accompanying journal editorial. ""There haven't been breakthrough treatments for heart failure for a long time,"" she said.

Cimaglermin, however, may be such a drug, she said. ""It's a remarkable thing that you could give a drug once and have it affect heart function three months later -- it's really extraordinary,"" she said.

Every drug currently used to treat heart failure has to be given daily or several times a day to get it to work, Bishopric said. ""And when you stop taking it, it stops working,"" she said.

Despite the encouraging results of this first trial, a lot more testing will be needed before cimaglermin can be considered a standard treatment for heart failure, Bishopric said.

""These findings need to be replicated in larger trials, and you have to be able to predict whether improved heart function from cimaglermin will help people live longer and feel better,"" she noted.

story_reviews_00310,"WEDNESDAY, Dec. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A shorter period of antibiotic treatment for ear infections in young children does more harm than good, a new study finds.

About three-quarters of children have ear infections in their first year of life. These infections are the most common reason why children are given antibiotics, the University of Pittsburgh researchers noted.

""Given significant concerns regarding overuse of antibiotics and increased antibiotic resistance, we conducted this trial to see if reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment would be equally effective along with decreased antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse reactions,"" Dr. Alejandro Hoberman said in a university news release. Hoberman is chief of the general academic pediatrics division at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.

The study included 520 youngsters with ear infections. The children ranged in age from 9 months to 23 months, and were randomly selected to receive either a standard 10-day course of antibiotics or a shortened five-day course of antibiotics followed by five days of placebos.

The risk of treatment failure was 34 percent in the five-day group and 16 percent in the 10-day group. What's more, the children in the five-day group didn't have a lower risk of antibiotic resistance or of side effects such as diarrhea or diaper rash.

""The results of this study clearly show that for treating ear infections in children between 9 and 23 months of age, a five-day course of antibiotic offers no benefit in terms of adverse events or antibiotic resistance,"" Hoberman said.

""Though we should be rightly concerned about the emergence of resistance overall for this condition, the benefits of the 10-day regimen greatly outweigh the risks,"" he added.

The study was published Dec. 21 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

story_reviews_00311,"LONDON (Reuters) - A non-surgical treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in which doctors inject a light-sensitive drug derived from deep-sea bacteria into a patient’s bloodstream was shown in a trial to kill cancer cells without destroying healthy tissue.

Results of a trial in 413 patients showed that the drug, which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate, was so effective that half the patients went into remission, compared with 13.5 percent in a control group.

“These results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,” said Mark Emberton, a University College London consultant urologist who led the trial. “This is truly a huge leap forward.”

The treatment, called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy or VTP, was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with the privately-owned STEBA Biotech.

The light-sensitive drug used, called WST11, is derived from bacteria found at the bottom of the ocean. To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency, Emberton’s team said in a study published in the journal Lancet Oncology.

The Weizmann scientists exploited this feature to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.

Men with low-risk prostate cancer are currently put under active surveillance, where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.

While radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and incontinence, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, the researchers said. No significant side-effects remained after two years.

In the trial, only 6 percent of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30 percent of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance.

The trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.

“The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,” Emberton said.

The VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.",Laser therapy with deep-sea drug kills prostate cancer in trial,1,Reuters Health
story_reviews_00312,"When teens want to sleep in on a school day, they’re not being lazy. For one, teens need more sleep than adults: about eight or nine hours a night, compared with about the six or seven their parents require. Teens, biologically, really do crave sleep.

Which is a problem when it comes to education. Most high schools start before 8 am to help parents get to work by 9 am. Early school start times also give kids more time for after-school activities like sports or theater.

But that has consequences: Around 69 percent of high school students get less than eight hours of sleep on a school night, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which puts these teens at risk of negative impacts on health.

There may be a simple fix: Start schools at a later time.

This is a solution supported by both the America Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AMA urges schools to start no earlier than 8:30 am. In 2014, the Academy of Pediatrics wrote that “the urgency and the magnitude of the problem of sleep loss in adolescents” warranted big changes in school start times.

But it’s not a foregone conclusion that later start times will ensure teens sleep more. Later start times could lead teens to go to bed even later. Or parents might still wake them up early. When it made its recommendation, the Academy of Pediatrics admitted “it is clear that additional research is needed to further document the effects of changes in school start times over time.”

Well, there’s some new (but still incomplete) evidence that later start times do help teens get more sleep.

A new meta-analysis in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine analyzed 18 studies on start times. It finds that when school starts up to an hour later, students typically do get around 19 minutes more sleep, on average. When start times are delayed more than an hour, that average increases to 53 minutes of extra sleep.

The study also found some preliminary evidence that later school start times were associated with better mental health outcomes. Only five of the 18 studies included these measures, but in two of them, later start time was associated with better (self-reported) feelings of depression and irritability.

More work needs to be done to confirm these findings. But even if later school start times only improve sleep time, that’s a positive step for public health. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.

Teens tend to be night owls, and forcing them to be early birds can mess with their health

Teens tend to go to sleep a bit later and wake up a bit later than the average adult — something called a “delayed” sleep phase. For most teens, it means their whole biological clock is shifted, and if they wake up too early, their body will be out of sync with the rest of the world. “Every neurotransmitter, hormone, and chemical in the body cycles with the daily rhythm,"" Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, told me earlier in the year.

When your body clock is off from society’s, scientists call it “social jet lag.” And like the jet lag from a long journey, it messes with your body.

Studies of adults find that social jet lag is associated with higher BMI, insulin resistance, depression, and a higher likelihood to engage in dangerous behaviors like smoking. And the group of people most at risk for social jet lag? Teens.

In a tightly controlled lab study, 24 healthy adult participants* who had their sleep shifted by one hour each day (simulating jet lag) started to look prediabetic after a three-week trial. Their resting metabolic rates dropped 8 percent. ""Assuming no changes in activity or food intake,"" that ""would translate into ~12.5 pounds increase in weight over a single year,"" the study, published in Science Translational Medicine in 2012, concluded.

People with a lot of social jet lag also tend to get fewer hours of sleep, which exacerbates these same health problems. On top of that, short sleep reduces powers of perception, concentration, and judgment. There’s some evidence that when students sleep better, they perform better in school as well.

(*A lot of the studies on social jet lag and short sleep use adults as their participants. But as the American Academy of Pediatrics reports, studies do also find an association between short sleep and obesity in adolescents.)

Delaying school start times is easier said than done

As Vox’s Libby Nelson has reported, very few schools have actually adopted this reform. This map, which reflects the most recent CDC data available, shows that across the country, schools still start very early.

There are some understandable reasons why. Nelson writes:

...the problem is usually logistics. Students of all ages usually share the same fleet of buses. High school students get the first shift, and the buses circle back to pick up their younger siblings later in the morning. Most districts don't want elementary school students to have to wait in the dark for buses early in the morning — nor do they want to pay for a separate fleet of school buses for elementary and middle school kids. Breaking with tradition turns out to be costly.

And even though the evidence is mostly in favor of increasing school start times, it isn’t a slam dunk quite yet.

There are some limitations to mention about the new meta-analysis. The studies mostly used self-reported measures of sleep duration. (More objective measures — like those obtained from Fitbit-like wristbands — are more accurate.) And many of the studies were short in duration, comparing sleep duration in snapshots before and after a school made a switch. More data would show whether the impact of school start time on sleep waned or improved over time.

“The aggregated quality of the evidence,” the study reports, “is only moderate.” The researchers also found no effect on academic performance. Furthermore, two of the studies found evidence that earlier start times were associated with increased vehicle accidents involving the teens. Being tired in the morning can be a dangerous distraction while on the road.

In all, the researchers call for more rigorous data on the topic. As schools change their start times, they write, researchers should sweep in to collect information on students’ sleep in a standardized way.

Regardless, it’s a promising area for study. Because if later school start times can truly help students sleep better, the research suggests that better sleep would lead to major improvements to their health and well-being.",Starting school later might really help sleep-deprived teens,4,Vox

Melanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles, according to new research.

The researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.

“There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.

Melanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies, she told Reuters Health.

“For example, men can’t see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears,” Robinson said.

The new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study. The participants attended “booster” training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years.

Overall, the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study, compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didn’t receive training.

Among people who received the skin exam training, the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later.

“Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson.

The exams didn’t become more embarrassing or less comfortable, either.

The new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles, said Robinson.

“That’s a simple enough statement, and people are not put off by that,” she said.

Bringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.

“We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson.

For now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).",Melanoma survivors' friends can help spot new moles,4,Reuters Health

Generally, guidelines classify donors older than 50 as “extended criteria donors,” but shortages have led to using these donors more frequently.

Italian researchers retrospectively studied 647 kidney transplants, grouping the donors according to whether they were in their 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s. Recipients were at most seven years older or younger than the donors. The study is in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Gary John Norman/Getty Images Gary John Norman/Getty Images

Any pet owner will tell you that their animal companions comfort and sustain them when life gets rough. This may be especially true for people with serious mental illness, a study finds. When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.

""When I'm feeling really low they are wonderful because they won't leave my side for two days,"" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, ""They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.""

Another person said of their pet birds: ""If I didn't have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it's — it's nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.""

Many people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they're doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.

Brooks says, ""Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren't available from friends and family.""

Brooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.

The participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.

Sixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle — the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.

The interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.

""I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],"" said one participant. ""There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always — we don't always understand.""

People with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.

""[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,"" one participant said. ""They don't question where you've been.""

The pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.

One study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they ""help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.""

Another participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.

And having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. ""They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,"" said one participant.

Another said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. ""That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.""

""The routine these pets provide is really important for people,"" says Brooks. ""Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.""

Many of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.

Mark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. ""We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.""

When he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.

The social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. ""I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,"" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.

Brooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it — just like the owners took care of them.

As one person in the study said, ""When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it's different, you know. It's just, like, he needs me as much as I need him.""",Pets Help People Manage The Pain Of Serious Mental Illness,3,mental health

story_reviews_00318,"Having an optimistic outlook on life may do more than just boost your mood. It may actually help you live longer, according to new research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive.

“Optimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,” postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. “So in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there’s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.”

For the study, the researchers analyzed data on from 2004 to 2012 on 70,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, a long-running research project tracking women’s health via surveys every two years.

To measure levels of optimism, participants were asked to use a five-point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements, such as, “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.”

The results showed that the most optimistic women – those in the top 25 percent – had a nearly 30 percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest 25 percent.

Specifically, the researchers found that the most optimistic women had:

a 16 percent lower risk of dying from cancer.

a 38 percent lower risk of dying from heart disease.

a 39 percent lower risk of dying from stroke.

a 38 percent lower risk of dying from respiratory disease.

The researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan, including marital status, education level, and other socioeconomic factors.

While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection.

“It’s a combination,” Hagan said. “If you’re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they’re exercising more, and they’re getting better sleep.”

However, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.

“So it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,” Hagan said. “Optimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.”

She said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.

The authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, “there is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.”

Finally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they’re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism.

“One is called ‘best possible self,’” Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News. “So you think about your different domains of life, whether it’s your personal relationship, your spouse, your career, your friendships, and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome.”

Hagan had some suggestions, too. “Simple things like thinking about what you’re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you’re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism, which can improve health outcomes as we’ve seen here,” she said.",How optimism may help you live longer,3,CBS News
story_reviews_00319,"Strobe lighting has been shown to reduce levels of the toxic proteins seen in Alzheimer’s disease, in findings that raise the tantalising possibility of future non-invasive treatments for the disease.

The study, in mice, found that exposure to flickering light stimulated brain waves, called gamma oscillations, that are known to be disturbed in Alzheimer’s patients. Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s.

The authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.

“If humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so non-invasive, and it’s so accessible,” said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper’s senior author.

Alzheimer’s research has faced a number of major setbacks – most recently the failure of Eli Lily’s drug trial – after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.

The latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.

The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer’s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.



To restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.



After an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells.

In a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer’s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.

Next, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be “not offensive at all” for a person to have in the background.

After being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.

Ed Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: “I was surprised, and it’s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.”

Questions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.

David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer’s.”

The authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs. Tsai and Ed Boyden, a colleague at MIT and co-author, have started a company called Cognito Therapeutics to pursue tests in humans.

story_reviews_00320,"About one in three couples struggling with infertility can trace their issues to poor quality semen, and men are given all kinds of advice about ways to produce healthier sperm. Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.

Now, researchers publishing in the journal Reproduction have found that another lifestyle change—exercise—may also help improve sperm quality.

In the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.

Compared to the control group that didn’t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.

“This fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,” says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “But this is a much better done study than almost anything that’s been done before on the subject.” He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.

In the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it’s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that’s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.

Exercise may also be working in other ways to enhance reproductive health, since all of the men who exercised lost weight, reduced their amount of body fat and improved their fitness levels. Fat tissue has been linked to higher levels of damaging metabolic stress compounds, so losing weight and becoming more fit may create more hospitable conditions for sperm and improve its quality and volume.

There are already plenty of reasons to exercise, and now better quality sperm is one more worth noting.

story_reviews_00321,"(Reuters Health) - - Exhausted shift workers may be safer driving home at night when they’re exposed to bright light before they hit the road, a small study suggests.

To test the effect of light therapy on driving, researchers did a series of three experiments with 19 adults. In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights’ sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.

After sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found.

“We experience severe sleepiness toward the end of the night shift, and this may overlap with our commute time,” said senior study author Dr. Ralph Mistlberger of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.

“Sleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,” Mistlberger added by email.

“Bright light is alerting,” Mistlberger said.

Sleepiness is a leading risk factor for automobile accidents because it can make drivers less vigilant, slow reaction times and dull cognitive abilities, researchers note in Sleep Medicine.

Shift workers with chronic sleep deprivation also face an increased risk of accidents. Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.

For the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.

They found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.

Exposure to bright light didn’t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. But light was associated with better driving.

Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.

“There is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,” said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.

“That said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,” Griffin added by email.

The proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.

“Drowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,” Winston said by email.

More research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.

But there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.

“Safety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,” Redelmeier said.

story_reviews_00322,"In findings that could pry open a door closed for nearly half a century, researchers have found that psilocybin — a hallucinogen long used in traditional healing rituals — eases the depression and soothes the anxiety of patients contending with serious illness and the prospect of imminent death.

In two separate studies published Thursday, researchers report that trial subjects who received a single moderate-to-large dose of psilocybin got substantial and lasting relief from their profound distress. Among 80 cancer patients who participated in the two trials, as many as 4 in 5 continued to feel measurably less hopeless and demoralized six months after taking the drug than they had upon their recruitment.

And even years later, many reported they had gained — and retained — a profound sense of peace and meaning from the experience. Of 29 cancer patients who got psilocybin in a trial conducted at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, 20 rated it as “among the most meaningful” events of their life.

“This drug saved my life and changed my life,” said Dinah Bazer, a Brooklyn, N.Y., woman who was administered a single dose of psilocybin at a New York treatment center in 2011.

In the wake of treatment for ovarian cancer, Bazer said, her anxiety at the prospect of its return was “eating her alive.” Under the influence of a single high dose of psilocybin, Bazer said Wednesday, she became “volcanically angry” as she visualized her cancer as a dark mass bearing down on her. With an epithet, she then saw herself throwing it off.

“I was bathed in God’s love” for hours after that, said Bazer, who describes herself as an atheist. When the psilocybin’s hallucinatory effects wore off, she said, two years of intense anxiety were simply gone.

“This is a groundbreaking result,” said Dr. George Greer, medical director of the Heffter Research Institute, the nonprofit organization that funded the two trials.

Greer suggested that the “existential anxiety” of the terminally ill is only one of many conditions that psilocybin may one day treat. Others may include treatment-resistant depression, addiction to cocaine, alcohol or tobacco, obsessive-compulsive disorder and “demoralization” in long-term survivors of HIV, he said.

Johns Hopkins University psychiatrist Dr. Roland R. Griffiths, the lead author of one of the two studies, said the enduring relief provided by a single dose of psilocybin makes such treatment more akin to surgery than it does to the plodding, labor-intensive treatments that remain the mainstay of his profession.

“I really don’t think we have any models in psychiatry that look like” the effects demonstrated in the two trials, said Griffiths. “Something occurs and it’s repaired and it’s better going forward … very plausibly for more than six months,” he added. “In that sense it’s a new model.”

The publication of the two early trials, in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, marks an American return to research on the therapeutic use of hallucinogenic drugs after a hiatus of 50 years.

In the 1950s and ’60s, hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide — LSD — and psilocybin, which is found naturally in certain mushrooms, were widely used in U.S. biomedical research and in psychotherapy practices. But in 1966, as the psychedelic drugs gained a broad counterculture following in the United States, the U.S. government declared any use of the drugs illegal. By the 1970s, that ended all American research on their potential therapeutic benefits.

In recent years, a small clutch of American researchers, including the authors of the two new papers, have argued that such prohibitions might be preventing the discovery of better treatments for widespread and pressing psychiatric problems, including depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

With PTSD epidemic among U.S. combat veterans and drug addiction a national scourge, American officials have indicated a new willingness to allow research to proceed on psychedelic and other drugs long classified as having no legitimate medical use.

On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration gave its blessing to conducting large-scale clinical trials of an experimental medication — 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — better known as the party drug ecstasy.

Like LSD and psilocybin, ecstasy appears to hold promise as an adjunct to psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD. If the resulting Phase 3 trials of ecstasy demonstrate their effectiveness, the next step could be FDA approval of ecstasy as a prescription drug.

The newly published trials of psilocybin are not quite so far advanced. Both studies were considered Phase 2 clinical trials, in which the safety and dosing regimens of a potential medication are still being tested. But both were considered to be double-blind placebo trials — the gold-standard of medical research in which subjects are left to guess whether they have gotten the active study drug or an inactive lookalike.

In one of the trials, researchers used a very low dose of psilocybin, much lower than that required to induce hallucinations, as a placebo. In the other, they used the dietary supplement niacin. In each trial, all of the subjects got a high dose of psilocybin in one of two sessions. So all, in the end, experienced the full effects of the drug.

All subjects in both trials had been diagnosed with cancer, and with “existential anxiety or depression” resulting from the illness and the likelihood of an early death. Participants were extensively prepared for the expected effects of the psilocybin. To minimize adverse reactions, researchers closely monitored the subjects while they were under the influence of the drug or the placebo. Afterwards, psychotherapists encouraged the subjects to write down and reflect upon the experience.

Immediately after, as well as five weeks after their first session, subjects who got the psilocybin first looked much better than did those who got the placebo first. A wide range of standardized measures of depression, anxiety and quality of life showed that these subjects were less hopeless, less demoralized and less anxious.

Six months out, 87% of those in the trial conducted at New York University/Langone reported their life satisfaction and/or well-being had been improved by the experience. In the larger of the two trials, conducted at Johns Hopkins University, psilocybin produced “large and significant … increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism” — effects that “were sustained at six months.”

Psilocybin’s side effects, meanwhile, were pretty tame. In the two trials, about 15% of subjects experienced nausea or vomiting when getting a high dose, and about 1 in 3 experienced some form of transient psychological discomfort. Many subjects’ heart rates and blood pressure rose, but none to a dangerous extent.

The potential use of psilocybin in patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases comes at a moment when medical care at the end of life is a subject of growing concern among patients and physicians. Research finds it’s still common for dying patients to get painful and futile procedures. Palliative and hospice care, both aimed at easing the discomfort of the seriously ill, are growing specialties in American hospitals. An increasing number of patients, meanwhile, are demanding the right to die with a physician’s help.

As states debate these physician-assisted suicide bills, they should consider the implications of finding an effective treatment for the “existential distress” of the dying, said Dr. Craig D. Blinderman, a palliative care specialist at Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital.

“It would seem to me, before we get to that point, we should explore approaches like psilocybin and hopefully not consider [physician-assisted suicide] as their only option,” said Blinderman, who was not involved in either of the two studies published Thursday.

But finding drugs like psilocybin effective is by no means the final hurdle to their widespread availability. None are currently in production, and no for-profit pharmaceutical company would likely invest millions of dollars to bring to market a pill intended effectively for one-time use.

Dr. Greer said that, in addition to “incubating the next generation of researchers” to explore the healing effects of psychedelic compounds, the New Mexico-based Heffter Institute is pondering a future in which specialized psychiatric clinics have routine access to psilocybin for treating patients. The institute is laying plans to scale up the production and distribution of a synthetic form of psilocybin that could make such treatments available at low cost to patients who could benefit from the drug, he said.

But hope may be on the way.

Scientists who study the immune system are beginning to understand the root cause of allergies — and are starting to work on next-generation therapies that could stop allergies in their tracks, rather than simply treating symptoms. Private investors and corporations are pouring money into the field.

Sean Parker, the internet mogul of Napster fame, donated $24 million to set up an allergy research center at Stanford University. Nestlé this month invested $145 million in a startup aimed at tackling peanut allergy. And the Broad Institute of Cambridge, Mass., recently launched a new initiative to unravel the basic biology of food allergy.

The potential market is huge: It’s estimated that 50 million Americans have allergies. As many as 10 percent of children suffer from hay fever, nearly 12 percent have skin allergies, and 5 percent have food allergies, most commonly peanuts, dairy, and shellfish, according to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey.

“I foresee that a lot of allergy therapies will become more and more specific and targeted, and more customizable to the individual patient,” said Andrew Long, the lead investigational drug pharmacist at Stanford’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research.

Answering ‘home brews’ with science



The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. Bay Area startup Aimmune, backed in part by Nestlé with that $145 million investment, is creating a methodical peanut desensitization pill that slowly weans patients away from allergy.

The company has identified the peanut proteins that trigger allergic reaction and is filling little capsules with the stuff. Patients start out by taking half a milligram of peanut protein, and gradually work their way up — over the course of about six months — to the equivalent of eating a single peanut.

“The people who need it the most are the people who have the most profound and potentially life-threatening reaction,” said Dr. Daniel Adelman, chief medical officer of Aimmune.

The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Aimmune’s peanut powder is in Phase 3 trials — and, despite its relative simplicity, is still considered something of a trailblazer in allergy science.

Tackling multiple allergies at once

Researchers at Stanford University are building on the concept of desensitization.

One of the drugs Long is excited about: omalizumab, a biologic drug made by Genentech under the trade name Xolair.

To understand how it works, you have to back up and look at why you get all itchy and wheezy when you encounter an allergen. Such responses make sense from an evolutionary standpoint: They initially came into being to protect our bodies against toxins, like snake venom, or to ward away parasites. But they can be deadly in the modern era.

Two types of immune cells — called mast cells and basophils — are the biggest culprits behind allergic reactions. When a person encounters an allergen, let’s say peanut protein, a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, gets activated. This stimulates the mast cells and basophils to release a storm of chemicals that provoke an allergic response to help exorcise peanut protein from the body.

Genentech’s drug is an engineered antibody that binds to human IgE, blocking it from triggering that chemical storm.

It was approved by the FDA in 2003 to treat a form of asthma often triggered by allergens, but Stanford researchers are now testing it on patients with food allergies — and finding that it might help speed along classic allergy desensitization therapy, in which patients are slowly introduced to escalating quantities of the allergen, via allergy shots or those “home brew” concoctions.

“Right now, the process of immunotherapy is painstakingly long — it takes not just weeks or months, but years, to treat a single allergy this way,” said Dr. Toshi Kawakami, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.

This timeline becomes untenable for patients with multiple allergies — and about 70 percent of people who have an allergy to one type of food will also be allergic to another, Long said.

So Stanford has paired Xolair with desensitization therapy to treat up to five different food allergens at any given time. Instead of taking years to gird a patient’s body against peanuts, they’re able to help her control her reactions to, say, hazelnuts, fish, dairy, and wheat as well.

Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, the antibody is expressed. In a paper published last year in Nature, Liang’s team found 30 genes that are involved in kicking off the allergic response.

“We think we’ll be able to identify a potential drug target here for allergy reaction — but, of course, it’ll take quite a long time to turn that into a medicine used by patients,” Liang said.

Testing a DNA vaccine for allergens

Another compelling approach is being taken by Japan’s Astellas Pharma (ALPMY), which is developing a DNA vaccine meant to protect the body from cedar pollen. (Hay fever has been called a “national affliction” in Japan, affecting a quarter of the population.)

The underlying research, from Immunomic Therapeutics and Johns Hopkins University, involves attaching a fragment of DNA from, say, cedar pollen to a template vaccine that can embed itself inside the cell. Once there, it revs up an aggressive immune response and imprints an “immunological memory,” which means the immune system will respond even more quickly to future exposures to the allergen.

The idea is to create resistance to an allergen without ever having to expose the patient to that substance. If it works, it’d be fairly easy to swap out the cedar pollen DNA for a different allergen — for instance, the genetic material that codes for peanut or cat antigens — and tack it onto this vaccine template.

“The beauty of this is that, unlike food desensitization or skin patches, patients aren’t exposed to the circulating antigen,” Long said. “That hypothetically decreases the risk for adverse events.”

Overcoming an industry’s fears

For all the research on allergies, none of the drugs in the pipeline is a sure thing.

For a cautionary tale, look no further than Circassia Pharmaceuticals, which has been working on an experimental immunotherapy drug to forestall cat allergies. Interest in Circassia had been sky-high — the small biotech’s market value had shot up to $1 billion earlier this year on speculation that its drug would prove effective.

But in a Phase 3 study, it turned out that the placebo effect was as effective as the drug itself. The company’s stock plummeted on that news this past June.

It’s not just that solving allergies is hard. Current medications — such as Benadryl, Claritin, and epinephrine (best known for powering the EpiPen) — do a decent job controlling symptoms in most patients, so there’s little incentive to innovate.

“There’s a dearth of new allergy products because antihistamines work so well,” said Dr. Todd Brady, CEO of Aldeyra Therapeutics (ALDX), a startup in Lexington, Mass., that’s developing a drug to reduce eye irritation from allergies.

“They’re generic, they’re cheap, they’re safe, and easy to use — but unfortunately, a lot of patients suffer because of that phenomenon, because not everyone responds to antihistamines,” Brady said.

Another reason for the hesitancy: liability concerns. It’s a risky proposition to give patients the foods they’re deathly allergic to — inducing anaphylactic reactions simply to test drugs in clinical trials.

“At the end of the day, it’s a fairly 19th-century approach,” said Dr. Wayne Shreffler, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who is working on the Broad Institute’s Food Allergy Science Initiative. “There’s really no doubt that there have been cold feet in the industry about this issue.”

But investigators around the world have shown they can carry out these “food challenge” trials safely — which could help hasten the development of new drugs.

“In school, we didn’t learn anything about allergy treatment, except antihistamines and epinephrine,” Long said. “But now, we’re seeing this whole new spectrum of treatments. It’ll be interesting to see how this translates into making it into a pharmacy, and into the hands of patients.”

story_reviews_00324,"WASHINGTON — Breaking a sweat? Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.

The experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it’s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin — and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.

If you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.

“Sweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,” said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University’s Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research.

Today’s wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be “radically different,” Rogers said.

For simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it’s time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.

Rogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.

How it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration’s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.

Together, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.

In two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers’ team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches’ performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today — taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson.

The patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches’ biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers’ conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

“It seems really practical,” said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn’t involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a color change, “such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.”

It’s a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao’s colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors.

Rogers’ sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday’s studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he’s now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.

story_reviews_00325,"It’s easy to get into the habit of popping a pill to have a good night’s sleep. Insomnia, which affects a third of adults, becomes more common as we age.

But as evidence has mounted about the risks of drugging the brain to induce or maintain slumber, more doctors are steering patients away from sleep aids, including over-the-counter medications, and are offering innovative behavioral-change solutions.

After reviewing more than 15 years of evidence, the American College of Physicians in May issued new guidelines for the management of chronic insomnia, recommending a form of counseling known as cognitive behavioral therapy as the first-line treatment for all adults. Drugs should be considered only if the therapy is unsuccessful, and only for a short course after a thorough discussion of the benefits, harms and costs, the guidelines say.

“Drugs don’t provide a natural sleep, and the side effects are significant,” says Nitin Damle, an internist and president of the American College of Physicians. “It’s true in all age groups, but even more problematic for older adults.”

In addition to their addictive properties, many prescription sleep aids can cause fuzzy thinking and memory gaps in the short term—like being unaware of taking a drive, eating or making phone calls. As bodies age, drugs remain longer in the body due to changes such as diminished liver and kidney function, which can cause fatigue, weakness, impaired balance and a dimming of other senses, increasing the risk for falls and car accidents. Longer term, sleep drugs may contribute to more serious mental-function issues, they can be costly, and they may not be covered by insurance for more than a short period.

Among the most commonly prescribed drugs are sedative hypnotics, which slow activity in the brain to bring on sleep. They include drugs known as benzodiazapenes, sold under brand names like Halcion, and non-benzodiazapenes, such as Ambien, Lunesta and Sonata. The American Geriatrics Society recommends against using benzodiazepines or other sedative hypnotics in older adults as first choice for insomnia because large-scale studies consistently show that the risk or motor-vehicle accidents, falls and hip fractures leading to hospitalization and death can more than double in older adults taking the drugs.

A new class of drugs known as orexin receptor antagonists act differently than sedative hypnotics, inhibiting the action of a chemical that promotes wakefulness. One, suvorexant, sold as Belsomra, helped people fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer in studies comparing it to a placebo, with no evidence of physical dependence after prolonged use or reports of withdrawal symptoms after stopping the drug. But as with other medications it has the potential to produce drowsiness the next day that might interfere with daily activities, and carries a warning that it may cause sleepwalking or other activities while asleep, like eating, talking, having sex or driving.

Over-the-counter drugs can be risky, too, such as pain medications with sleep aids that include the antihistamine diphenhydramine, part of a type of drugs known as anticholinergics. A study last year in JAMA Internal Medicine suggested higher cumulative use of anticholinergics, which can impair memory and attention, is associated with an increased risk for dementia.

Doctors may initially prescribe sleeping pills when a patient is under stress. “The intent is for them to be on a short course, and then get off of it,” says David Maness, a professor of family medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. “But then the problem is perpetuated, and before you know it, it’s 10 years later, and it keeps getting refilled and no one has reviewed it.”

A review that Dr. Maness co-wrote, published last December by the American Academy of Family Physicians, suggests that a combination of nondrug therapies can help patients just say no to sleep drugs.

Cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be delivered in as few as two sessions with a trained therapist or nurse, has been shown to relieve chronic insomnia and improve daytime functioning for up to two years.

“ Drugs don’t provide a natural sleep, and the side effects are significant ” —Nitin Damle, President, American College of Physicians

Typically, patients are asked to fill out a sleep diary, recording their bedtime, rise time and how long it takes to fall asleep. The patients also record factors such as the number of naps, alcoholic beverages and stresses in a day. Writing down troubling thoughts and worries before bedtime may help clear the mind, making it easier to fall asleep, according to the National Sleep Foundation. One aim of cognitive behavioral therapy is to pinpoint actions that may be prohibiting sleep, and thus develop a customized list of do’s and don’ts for optimal “sleep hygiene.”

Some are obvious, like sleeping in a cool, dark room, and avoiding caffeine, alcohol and tobacco before bedtime. (Contrary to popular belief, alcohol is a deterrent to a sound sleep.) Others are more ingenious: To avoid literally watching the sleepless hours go by, hide the clock.

Relaxation training can help as well, including yoga, and techniques to relax muscles from the feet to the face.

Once patients are dependent on sleep drugs, going cold turkey can just make things worse, says Sean Jeffrey, director of clinical pharmacy services at Hartford Healthcare and a clinical professor at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy. He advises patients on a tapering-off schedule “so it doesn’t feel like you are ripping off a band-aid.”

Dr. Jeffrey encourages patients to exercise and get outdoors in bright morning sunlight to help set the body’s clock for sleep in the evening.

Every year when Morton Pollner had his checkup, he worried that doctors would find something on his lung. For years, they didn't. Then his luck ran out.

""My reaction was, 'Well, you smoked for 30 years. You got away with it for another 30 years and this is it.' I thought it was a death sentence,"" he says.

Pollner, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didn't expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70.

Older patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they won't be able to tolerate it. So they are referred for supportive care to control symptoms, rather than surgery to remove the cancer.

But many patients can survive and even thrive after surgery, says Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was senior author of a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October. The study looked at more than 2,000 patients with Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer who had surgery to remove their tumor. About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75.

And he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free.

""They did well and beat their lung cancer,"" Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor.

This was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of Adusumilli's patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life.

""Whatever I get from here on, it's like gravy,"" he says.

Surgery isn't the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says it's important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades.

Seventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate.

""We shouldn't allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,"" Lichtenfeld says.",Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery,2,Cancer

story_reviews_00328,"U.S. prisons are experimenting with a high-priced monthly injection that could help addicted inmates stay off opioids after they are released, but skeptics question its effectiveness and say the manufacturer has aggressively marketed an unproven drug to corrections officials.

A single shot of Vivitrol, given in the buttocks, lasts for four weeks and eliminates the need for the daily doses common with alternatives such as methadone. But each shot costs as much as $1,000, and because the drug has a limited track record, experts do not agree on how well it works.

Proponents say Vivitrol could save money compared with the cost of locking up a drug offender — about $25,000 a year for each inmate at the Sheridan Correctional Center, 70 miles southwest of Chicago.

New drug offered to addicted inmates combats opioid epidemic

Dr. Joshua Lee, of New York University’s medical school, said more evidence is needed to determine whether the medication can help substantial numbers of people and whether it’s worth paying for, but the early results are encouraging.

“It sounds good, and for some of us, it feels like the right thing to do,” said Lee, a leading researcher on the treatment.

Vivitrol is emerging as the nation searches for ways to ease an opioid epidemic that affects more than 2 million Americans and an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. prison population. Many experts view prisons — where addiction’s human toll can be seen most clearly — as a natural place to discover what works.

Christopher Wolf had already served prison time for nonviolent crimes when he was ordered into treatment for a heroin addiction by a judge who suggested Vivitrol. Three months later, the 36-year-old from Centerville, Ohio, is clean and working full time as a cook.

He now suggests the medication to other addicts.

“I don’t have cravings,” Wolf said. “I see how much better life is. It gets better really fast.”

Vivitrol targets receptors in the brain’s reward system, blocking the high and extinguishing urges. In some programs, prisoners get an injection before release, then follow-up shots from any clinic.

For decades, researchers have recognized addiction as a relapsing brain disease with medication an important part of therapy. But most jails and prisons reject methadone and buprenorphine, the other government-approved medications for opioid addiction, because they are habit-forming and can be abused.

Just ask Joshua Meador, 28, an inmate at Sheridan who hopes to get into the Vivitrol program before his release in January. Before incarceration, he abused both older treatment drugs. When given take-home doses of methadone for the weekend, he would sell them for heroin.

“When I’m on Vivitrol, I can’t get high,” he said. The drug has no street value or abuse potential.

“You couldn’t design something better for the criminal justice system,” said David Farabee of the University of California at Los Angeles, who leads a Vivitrol study in a New Mexico jail. “There’s been pushback with other medications, people saying, ‘We’re just changing one drug for another.’ That argument goes out the window when you’re talking about a blocker” like Vivitrol.

Prison systems in Illinois, Vermont, Wyoming and Wisconsin are trying the drug on a small scale. Michigan is offering Vivitrol to parolees who commit small crimes, if addiction is the reason for their new offense. The federal Bureau of Prisons ran a field trial in Texas and plans to expand the program to the Northeast next year. The drug’s manufacturer hopes prisons will be the gateway to a larger market.

Also known as extended-release naltrexone, the medication won Food and Drug Administration approval for alcohol dependence in 2006 and in 2010 to prevent relapse in post-detox opioid users.

The evidence for giving Vivitrol to inmates is thin but promising.

In the biggest study, sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 300 offenders — most of them heroin users on probation or parole — were randomly assigned to receive either Vivitrol or brief counseling and referral to a treatment program.

After six months, the Vivitrol group had a lower rate of relapse, 43 percent compared with 64 percent. A year after treatment stopped, there had been no overdoses in the Vivitrol group and seven overdoses, including three deaths, in the other group. The results, published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine, have been promoted by the drugmaker, Ireland-based Alkermes, as it markets Vivitrol to U.S. correctional systems.

Yet addiction is stubborn. When the injections stopped, many in the study relapsed. A year later, relapse rates looked the same in the two groups.

“It does suggest six months wasn’t enough,” said Lee, the lead author.

T.J. Voller was a Vivitrol success story — until he wasn’t. After Vivitrol was approved by the FDA, Voller talked about getting the shot with The Associated Press and Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN segment. The 30-year-old was back at work and seemed proud of his recovery. But after 10 months on Vivitrol, he died of a heroin overdose.

“He was alone for the weekend and picked up that needle one last time,” said his mother, Kathi Voller of Raynham, Massachusetts.

Advocates argue that inmates have a constitutional right to all FDA-approved addiction medications throughout their incarceration.

“Treatment should be offered from the moment they are brought into the system,” said Sally Friedman, legal director of the New York-based Legal Action Center, which is looking for a test case to bring to court.

Physicians have learned to be cautious about pharmaceutical company marketing, said Andrew Kolodny, senior scientist at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University.

Not so for criminal justice officials, who may be too trusting, Kolodny said.

“When the drug company sends someone in to give them a talk and buy them pizza, they think they’re getting a scientific lecture,” he said.

Alkermes spokeswoman Jennifer Snyder said the company’s sales team helps educate corrections staff and community care providers only after they have shown interest in Vivitrol.

There’s widespread agreement that counseling, support groups and treatment for underlying problems such as depression are crucial for Vivitrol patients, said Dr. Joseph Garbely of Pennsylvania-based Caron Treatment Centers, which supports medication-assisted treatment and prefers Vivitrol.

“The disease of addiction is a cunning, baffling and powerful one,” Garbely said. “And you need all hands on deck.”","Prisons fight opioids with $1,000 Vivitrol injections: Does it work?",5,Associated Press
story_reviews_00329,"The recommendations also support the position of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, which in 2013 radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient’s low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or “bad cholesterol” to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors.

“People with no signs, symptoms, or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke,” said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who chairs the task force.

AD

AD

The task force, which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government, concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed. But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.

The new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors — such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years — should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk “may also benefit” but did not definitively recommend they take them. “People in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,” the task force advised.

AD

AD

In contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.

Another important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that “the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.” In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is “uncertainty and hesitation” in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.

AD

The task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk — but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.

Individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.

There is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that “it’s a force for good.” But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects — which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women — should be taken more seriously.

AD

AD

In an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take “a step back” and ask “why this debate is so contentious.” They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are “weak,” and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.

“In deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,” they wrote.

The two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.

AD

AD

Statins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.

The task force’s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study, published Saturday, that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not. They are more likely to not only get to the hospital and survive until they are discharged but also survive in greater numbers a year after their hospitalization than those who do not use statins.

story_reviews_00331,"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient’s blood.

The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device.

The researchers say the technology, although still in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in a similar way to diabetes patients checking their blood sugar levels.

It could be particularly useful in remote settings to help HIV patients manage their treatment more effectively, since current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory.

“Monitoring viral load is crucial to the success of HIV treatment. At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result,” said Graham Cooke, who co-led the research from the Imperial’s department of medicine.

“We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.”

The test, which uses a mobile phone chip, requires a drop of blood to be placed onto a spot on the USB stick. Any HIV in the sample triggers an acidity change, which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. This is sent to the USB stick, which shows the result on a computer or electronic device.

Published in the journal Scientific Reports, results showed the stick test was 95 percent accurate over 991 blood samples, and the average time to produce a reading was 20.8 minutes.

Some 36 million people worldwide are infected with the human deficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, and the majority of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Current AIDS drugs, called anti-retrovirals, reduce virus levels in a patients blood to near zero.

But in some cases the drugs stop working - sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them - and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient’s so-called “viral load”.

The research was presented in May at the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health in Las Vegas. While the study was small and lacked a control group, Dr. Streeter and her colleagues are planning a randomized controlled trial to further test the intervention.

“The findings were exciting,” she said. “They show that a behavioral intervention can have effects of similar magnitude as an antidepressant.”

Controlled breathing may also affect the immune system. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects’ saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing exercise group’s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress. The findings were published in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine in August.

Here are three basic breathing exercises to try on your own.

Coherent Breathing

If you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.",Breathe.

story_reviews_00333,"For older people who fracture a hip, the prognosis is grim: a third or more die within a year and only about 1 in 5 return to their pre-injury level of function.

A new approach to care could mean it doesn’t have to be that way.

More hospitals are putting hip fracture patients on a fast track from the emergency room to the operating room, repairing the fracture in as little as six hours after diagnosis. The approach appears to produce significantly better outcomes for patients than the conventional practice of waiting up to three days before operating on the fracture. It can also reduce the costs of complications and longer hospital stays.

Fast-track hospitals also are providing follow-up care in special geriatric fracture clinics that steer patients through rehabilitation, provide treatment to strengthen bones and help them return to independent living.

An estimated 340,000 older adults suffer hip fractures in the U.S. annually, and many of them have other medical issues such as high blood pressure or heart disease. Doctors and surgeons have taken the position that fractures weren’t true emergencies, and studies suggested delaying surgery allows more time to evaluate patients and stabilize other conditions before giving them medical clearance for an operation.

But a review of more than 2 million patients led by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, and published last year in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, found that compared with same-day surgery, each additional day of delay was associated with a significantly higher overall complication rate. And surgery two days and three or more days after admission was associated with higher rates of death.

The deaths are a combination of “complications related to the hip fracture and surgery, and overall decline in health that seems to be hastened after hip fracture,” says Dr. Joseph Zuckerman, study co-author and chair of Orthopaedic Surgery at NYU Langone.

“We have to start thinking differently, and treat a hip fracture with the same urgency as a heart attack or a stroke,” says Philip J. Devereaux, a cardiologist and researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He says delays can cause the physical trauma of a fracture to spark inflammatory responses in the body that increase stress on the heart and the immune system and increase risk for complications.

Dr. Devereaux, who also heads a surgical research group at McMaster’s Population Health Research Institute, is leading a large international trial, called Hip Attack, which will enroll up to 3,000 patients in 20 countries. The study will compare surgery within 6 hours for a hip fracture against standard care, typically surgery 24 hours after diagnosis. The aim is to determine the impact of accelerated surgery on death, heart attack, stroke, infection, and major bleeding. A pilot study in 2013, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, suggested patients receiving accelerated surgery had a 40% lower risk of major complications.

It took just one missed step for Martha Aldredge, 76, to fall and fracture her hip one evening last April while looking for a seat at her granddaughter’s high school concert near Greenville, S.C. Though bystanders helped her up and she managed to sit through the concert, she wasn’t able to walk when it was over. After being helped into a rolling chair, a friend drove her to the emergency room of the Bon Secours St. Francis Health System’s Eastside campus in Greenville.

An X-ray showed the hip was badly fractured, so she was transferred by ambulance to the St. Francis Hospital in downtown Greenville where orthopedic surgeon Michael O’Boyle oversees the Osteoporotic Fracture Program dedicated to the care of older patients with hip fractures.

In the OR the next day at 5 p.m., Dr. O’Boyle inserted a long y-shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee. Ms. Aldredge stayed on an orthopedic floor for three days before being transferred to a rehabilitation floor for four more days.

“They made me walk right away, which turned out to be a great thing,” Ms. Aldredge says. Dr. O’Boyle’s team told her about the importance of building up muscle and she started outpatient physical therapy a week later, going two days a week for three months. She was able to stop using a walker and, after a break from therapy, is continuing for several more sessions to build her stamina. She is back to driving herself, and says her bones are in good enough shape that she doesn’t anticipate future problems.

Dr. O’Boyle says it took a major cultural change to provide such care at St. Francis. In the past, he says, hip fracture patients were triaged as non-urgent cases in the ER, where they waited on average for eight hours, and then might wait nearly three more days for surgery, scheduled as a “waiting list” case. Patients were given heavy narcotics for pain, which contributed to a problem known as postoperative delirium for close to 80% of them, leading to longer hospital stays. There was little coordination of care among doctors, nurses and social workers to ensure good follow up care, and patients and families were often anxious due to poor communication. “We were not doing a good job, and the results were abysmal,” Dr. O’Boyle says.

The fracture clinic has helped improve results. The team coordinates care with emergency medical services to make sure patients don’t get too many narcotics and fluids before they arrive at the hospital. Time in the ER has been cut in half, and most cases are in surgery within 14 to 19 hours.

Since 2007, hospital stays have been reduced to less than four days from more than eight days. The delirium rate has been cut to 10%, and 75% of patients return to independent living. The mortality rate one-year postoperatively is less than 18%, according to Dr. O’Boyle. And patient and family satisfaction scores are at nearly 100%.

The clinic also coordinates care after discharge with rehabilitation programs, which it had not done in the past, to ensure patients follow its post-op instructions and are closely monitored during physical therapy sessions. Dr. Boyle’s team also evaluates and treats patients for osteoporosis and provides education on nutrition, falls prevention and exercise programs.

“We took an injury that was neglected and pushed off to the side with no sense of urgency and made it a priority, “Dr. O’Boyle says.

Confused about calcium?

That wouldn’t be surprising. The mineral found in popular supplement pills — and in dairy foods, leafy greens and many fortified foods — is unquestionably good for your bones. But in recent years, doctors have raised concerns that calcium supplements might be over-used and bad for hearts.

Recently, two new studies made headlines. One found a link between the supplements and a build-up of calcium in arteries, a possible precursor to heart attacks and strokes.

A second, wider-ranging study found no heart risks and was the basis of new guidelines from two medical groups saying that calcium supplements should be considered heart safe.

“The public has been receiving very confusing and alarming messages about calcium supplements,” says JoAnn Manson, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston.

About 35% of U.S. adults take calcium supplements, alone or in multivitamins, according to a recent report in the medical journal JAMA.

So here’s what all those people need to know.

Concerns about heart risks may be fading.

Over the past decade, some studies have raised the possibility that calcium, from supplements but not from food, might raise heart risks.

Most recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University tracked nearly 3,000 adults and found that those who took calcium supplements at the study outset were 22% more likely to show artery calcification 10 years later. Those who got the most calcium from food had a decreased risk. But the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was not designed in a way that could prove the supplements caused the artery changes.

And its findings were quickly refuted by a larger review of 31 previous studies, including some with more rigorous designs. Taken together, those findings suggest healthy adults face no increased heart risks from calcium, in food or supplements, in amounts of up to 2,000-2,500 mg a day, researchers reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The review was funded by the non-profit National Osteoporosis Foundation, with support from Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which makes calcium supplements.

“If you look at the overall totality of the evidence, there’s a lack of association between supplement use and heart attack and other cardiovascular events,” says Manson, who co-wrote an editorial accompanying the review.

The review “is really reassuring,” says Clifford Rosen, senior scientist at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute at the University of Maine. He was not involved in the research.

Also reassured: The osteoporosis foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, which issued new guidelines saying supplements appear heart safe.

Not everyone is convinced.

The larger review did not include all potentially relevant studies, says Erin Michos, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology who led the Johns Hopkins study. “I’m still concerned about harm from supplements and I don’t advise them for my patients,” she says.

There are other reasons not to take calcium supplements.

The first is that most people don’t need them, Rosen says. Calcium intake from food has been rising, he says, with recent surveys finding averages around 1,000 mg a day — close to or meeting the 1,000 mg. to 1,200 mg recommended for adults (the higher level is advised for women over 50 and men over 70). Many people get more than they realize, he says, not just from milk, cheese and yogurt, but from vegetables, grains, and, increasingly, fortified foods and beverages.

When there is a gap, food is a better choice than supplements, the experts agree. Calcium-rich foods, such as milk (300 mg a cup), plain yogurt (400 mg per cup) and kale (100 mg a cup), come with added nutritional benefits. And supplements come with extra risks: increases in kidney stones and, for some people, constipation and bloating.

Some people do need supplements.

Older adults with osteoporosis — bone thinning severe enough to raise the risk of debilitating fractures — can benefit from calcium supplements, Rosen says, though most need just one 500 mg to 600 mg dose a day. Larger doses are poorly absorbed and rarely needed, he says.

Among others who might need a boost: Vegans, people with lactose intolerance and anyone who, for whatever reason, does not consume enough calcium, says Taylor Wallace, an affiliate professor of nutrition at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and a co-author of the new cardiovascular statement.

Teen girls, who are in crucial bone-building years, often have diets that fall short of their needs, 1,300 mg a day, Wallace says.

Your bones need more than calcium alone.

Vitamin D — found in fatty fish, fortified foods and supplements, and produced by the skin in response to sun exposure — also is essential to bone health. Many supplements combine vitamin D and calcium, but experts disagree on who should take those supplements and in what doses. Under current U.S. nutrition guidelines, teens and adults are advised to get 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D each day.

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, Nov. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Obese patients who swallowed balloon capsules that helped them eat less lost an average of 15 pounds, roughly two times more weight than patients who just dieted and exercised, researchers report.

The capsule was inflated with gas via a catheter when it reached the stomach. As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.

In addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn't known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.

The study lasted a year, but ""we don't know what happens after that,"" Pryor said.

""If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,"" she said. ""The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.""

The balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

An advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.

""There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn't want to go back to work after that,"" Pryor added.

Pryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don't want surgery. ""For people who want to lose some weight but don't feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they're afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,"" she suggested.

The findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans. Research presented at meeting is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

One weight-loss expert expressed some doubts about the findings.

""I still question the efficacy of balloons,"" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""While there is potentially easier insertion that does not require sedation, I still doubt after removal there will be weight loss,"" he said.

Roslin said patients who have other treatments that restrict their ability to eat -- such as bands and bypass operations that reduce the size of the stomach -- often regain lost weight over time. ""As time goes on, weight loss will be about lifestyle changes,"" he said.

The only argument for the balloon is that it starts the lifestyle changes, Roslin said. ""It may make it easier to become motivated,"" he said. ""But I believe that few will maintain weight loss two years after any balloon.""

For the study, Pryor and her colleagues randomly assigned nearly 400 obese patients to receive a real or sham device. All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.

During the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.

People treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.

As for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate.

The results were also presented at a medical meeting in May.

One health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.

""A gastric balloon may help with weight loss, but will do nothing to improve diet quality and overall health,"" said Dr. David Katz. He is director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn., and president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.

The role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.

""Such devices may be alternatives to bariatric surgery in some cases. But they should not distract us from the far better solution at the population level: practices, programs and policies that make eating well and being active a cultural norm,"" Katz said.

Writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice — and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans.

The study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites, one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom. It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.

“If you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,” said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.

Many parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.

“It's almost symbiotic,” Navarro said, “because in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.”

AD

AD

Perhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.

Thinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease — a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten — who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.

For the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.

It was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.

So Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit — a compound called AIP-2 — and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment — “I don't even know how much that is in mouse years,” Navarro said.

The researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells — a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.

AD

AD

“It is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,” Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.

This suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice. Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.

Should that work, it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma. The compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders, like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.

AD

This study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years. “There’s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system,” Navarro said.

AD

She wouldn't go so far as to call parasites good. Deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia, malnutrition, developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections.

“But what we need is to find what's good in them,” she said, “and try to restore that missing component.”

story_reviews_00337,"Testing cholesterol in toddlers and babies? Study says it could help

What if a blood test could reveal that your child is at high risk for early heart disease years in the future, giving you a chance to prevent it now? A big study in England did that — screening thousands of babies for inherited risk — and found it was twice as common as has been thought.

The study also revealed parents who had the condition but didn’t know it, and had passed it on to their children. Ninety percent of them started taking preventive medicines after finding out.

Researchers say the two-generation benefits may convince more parents to agree to cholesterol testing for their kids. An expert panel in the United States recommends this test for children between the ages of 9 and 11, but many aren’t tested now unless they are obese or have other heart risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure.

advertisement

For every 1,000 people screened in the study, four children and four parents were identified as being at risk for early heart disease. That’s nearly twice as many as most studies in the past have suggested.

“We really need to pay attention to this,” said Dr. Elaine Urbina, director of preventive cardiology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and a member of the US. expert panel. “It’s reasonable to screen for something that’s common, dangerous and has a treatment that’s effective and safe.”

Dr. William Cooper, a pediatrics and preventive medicine professor at Vanderbilt University, called it “an innovative approach” that finds not just kids at risk but also parents while they’re still young enough to benefit from preventive treatment, such as cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.

Statins aren’t recommended until around age 10, but certain dietary supplements such as plant sterols and stanols could help younger kids, Urbina said.

“We’re not talking about putting all these kids on statins,” she said.

The study was led by Dr. David Wald at Queen Mary University of London. He and another author founded a company that makes a combination pill to prevent heart disease. The work was funded by the Medical Research Council, the British government’s health research agency. Results were published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine.

Researchers were testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that, untreated, raises the risk of a heart attack by age 40 tenfold.

They did a heel-stick blood test on 10,059 children ages 1 to 2 during routine immunization visits to check for high cholesterol and 48 gene mutations that can cause the disorder. If a child was found with the disorder, parents were tested.

One in 270 children had the gene mutations; others were identified through cholesterol levels alone.

“That’s a pretty common genetic defect,” said Dr. Stephen Daniels, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and a member of the US expert panel.

But many parents balk at the idea of testing children for a disorder associated with middle age, experts say.

Karen Teber, a media relations specialist in Madison, Wis., was surprised when a doctor wanted to test her 12-year-old stepson. “My reluctance was really born out of lack of information,” she said. “I hadn’t heard of it before.”

The study did not address whether screening is cost-effective. In the US, cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance though much lower prices often are negotiated. The study authors in England estimated that if cholesterol testing costs $7 and gene testing costs $300, it would cost $2,900 for every person identified as having the disorder.

story_reviews_00338,"A new form of therapy has for the first time been shown to improve the symptoms and behaviour of autistic children, offering a potential breakthrough in care for millions of families.

Six years after parents were trained to better understand and interact with their preschool children, researchers found that the therapy had moderated the behaviour of those who had been severely autistic, unresponsive or unable to speak.

I’ve gone from refrigerator mother to super parent | Letters Read more

A child who might have run around a supermarket squealing, heedless of their parent, putting objects in their mouth and pushing past shoppers to try to press the buttons at checkout, might instead wait in the queue and even help load the trolley, the research found.

The success of the preschool autism communication trial (Pact) has surprised even the researchers who designed it. There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.

Prof Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.

Schoolgirls with autism share experiences in young adult novel Read more

“The advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,” he said. “Our findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.

“This is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.”

The trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.

The therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.

Other experts applauded the work. “I can see why these researchers are excited,” said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. “These results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.”

Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered “a hugely cheering message for families”, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it “a remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive”.

The absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children’s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.

“Parents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,” said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. “Too often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.”

The researchers said children’s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.

About 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe. The lifetime costs to the UK, which include health, social care and education costs as well as productivity losses, are estimated at £1m to £1.5m per child and between $1.4m and $2.4m in the United States.",Study offers potential breakthrough in care of children with autism,3,The Guardian
story_reviews_00339,"Your cells might be aging faster than you are, and new tests purport to help you find out.

A few companies are offering mail-order testing to measure the length of people’s telomeres, the protective caps of DNA on the ends of chromosomes that have been likened to the plastic tips that prevent shoelaces from fraying. Telomeres gradually shorten as people age and eventually may disappear, leaving cells vulnerable to disease and death.

Telomere Diagnostics, of Menlo Park, Calif., launched an $89 test last week. Users mail in a drop of blood and get back a calculation of their age in “TeloYears,” adjusted up or down depending on how they compare with the general population. The service also provides advice for improving diet, fitness, sleep and stress levels, which some small studies suggest may help telomeres regain length.

“There’s a difference between knowing how old you are, and how well you are aging,” says Telomere Diagnostics chief executive Jason Shelton. “The age you are on the inside, on the cellular level, may be a better indicator.”

Still, some top telomere scientists say such information amounts to little more than high-tech palm reading, in part because telomere length varies so widely in the general population that it isn’t clear what length is problematic.

“We don’t yet know how to interpret these results. It might suggest there is something wrong when there isn’t,” says Carol Greider, director of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how telomeres protect chromosomes.

What Your Cells Can Tell You What are telomeres?

Telomeres are stretches of DNA at the end of chromosomes that protect them from damage, but they gradually wear away each time cells divide. When telomeres become critically short, chromosomes can fuse together and malfunction, causing cells to die, which contributes to disease.

How do telomeres relate to aging?

Many studies have linked diseases of aging with short telomeres, but it isn’t clear whether short telomeres are a sign of cellular age or help cause the process.

Can this process be slowed?

Telomere shortening is determined by heredity, environment and lifestyle choices. Some studies suggest that controlling inflammation, exercising, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and not smoking, can slow the rate of shortening. An enzyme called telomerase adds more length to telomeres, but it is mostly found in sperm, egg and stem cells and cancerous tumors. There is no evidence that telomerase supplements help.

Can measuring my telomeres tell me how long I have to live?

No. Most people never reach the end of their telomeres, and some scientists say they have to be extremely short before they contribute to disease.

Fellow Nobel winner Elizabeth Blackburn, now president of the Salk Institute, co-founded the predecessor company to Telomere Diagnostics, but parted ways with it in 2013 and is no longer connected to the company. Dr. Blackburn declined to comment for this article.

Since telomeres were discovered in the 1990s, hundreds of studies have suggested links between telomere length and heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and mental-health issues.

A meta-analysis of 24 studies involving a total of 43,725 participants, including 8,400 with cardiovascular diseases, found that those in the bottom third of telomere length had a 50% greater risk of cardiovascular disease than those in the top third. The review was published in BMJ in 2014.

While telomere length is largely influenced by genetics, environment and lifestyle choices can affect it, too. Studies suggest shorter telomeres are associated with lack of exercise, poor sleep and a diet high in refined carbohydrates, among other factors.

NASA believes that lengthy space travel can also age people faster and is monitoring how the telomeres of astronauts and twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly change over time. Scott spent nearly a year in space, orbiting Earth in the Space Station, about four times as long as Mark.

Few studies have looked at whether people can lengthen their telomeres by adopting healthy choices. An often cited clinical trial, published in the Lancet in 2013, followed 35 men with low-risk prostate cancer for five years. It found that the 10 men who followed a program of diet, activity, stress management and social support lengthened their telomeres by about 10% compared with the 25 who didn’t. The study was conducted by researchers at University of California, San Francisco, and the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute.

Critics say the few controlled trials that show people can lengthen their telomeres are very small and the large observational studies that make up the bulk of the scientific literature on telomeres don’t demonstrate cause and effect. And while exercise, a healthy diet and stress reduction may lower the risk of death and disease, it hasn’t been shown that telomere length has anything to do with it, some researchers say.

Much of what is known about telomeres and disease comes from studying people who have inherited extremely short telomeres and are vulnerable to several specific conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, immune deficiency, loss of bone marrow and certain cancers. It is important for those people, who make up at most 10% of the population, to know if their telomeres are abnormally short because they should avoid certain treatments, says Mary Armanios, clinical director of the Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.

“For everyone else, based on what we know in 2016, telomere length is not relevant to disease risk,” Dr. Armanios says. “They have to be really, really short to cause disease and most people never get to that point as they age.”

The testing companies argue that the wealth of observational studies provides ample evidence that short telomeres are a risk factor for many diseases in the general population and that making healthy lifestyle changes can help telomeres regain length. Knowing your telomere length isn’t meant to diagnose a specific disease, they say. “It’s more like a check-engine light” on a car, an early indication that something is amiss, says Calvin Harley, chief scientific officer at Telomere Diagnostics, which recommends users take the test every six months to track their progress.

Other testing companies also contend that shorter-than-average telomeres can be a warning sign of future health problems. Titanovo Inc., in Raleigh, N.C., uses cheek swabs for its $150 test. Life Length, based in Madrid, offers its test only through physicians, who it says can help patients understand what they are most at risk for. The test, which costs $395, measures all 92 telomeres in cell samples, rather than reporting averages, as Telomere Diagnostics does.

Stephen Matlin, Life Length’s chief executive, says tens of thousands of patients in the U.S., the U.K. and the Middle East have used the test. While it isn’t known if they have lengthened their telomeres, “we do see that people adopt major lifestyle changes to improve their health and fitness,” he says.

story_reviews_00340,"The genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force -- and in a few extreme cases, it can be deadly. Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story:

Amy and Brad Price’s home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you’ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5½ of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.

“She was happy all the time,” Brad said.

Amy added, “She loved pretty dresses.”

“She loved her tutu,” Brad said.

She was talkative, addicted to “Caillou,” the animated TV series, a lively little girl, ‘til she was two. “Her knees were going a little knock-kneed,” Amy said. “And she had been just randomly falling down.”

Her doctor said, “Nothing to worry about,” but she quickly got worse.

“I was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,” Amy recalled. “And I turned around and said, ‘Liviana, what’s wrong?’ And she said, ‘Mommy, my legs don’t work.’”

Liviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: “She’s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they’re telling me she’s gonna die.”

Many children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn’t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.

“I get a call from the doctor’s office,” said Amy, “I knew. And I was thinking, ‘I’ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.’”

Except that’s not what happened.

Doing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni’s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.

The Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.

“The patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,” said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.

A patient’s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient’s body.

Here’s what’s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can’t get AIDS.

Why the HIV virus? “Is it particularly efficient at getting around the body?” Teichner asked.

“Yeah, it’s very efficient in entering our cells, and that’s why we use it,” Dr. Biffi replied.

How well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. “At least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,” Dr. Biffi said. “Some of the children were going to school and having a normal life.”

Giovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.

Brad Price calls Dr. Biffi “Our angel. She took us in like family.”

So why Italy, and not the United States?

Gene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it’s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.

Teichner asked, “Do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?”

“I think yes, absolutely,” Dr. Biffi replied.

The MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what’s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.

Trials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.

Compare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that’s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.

For her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. “It’s decline in slow motion, and that’s difficult,” said Carr.

“I remember the social worker said, ‘It’s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,’” Kefalis said.

After more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter’s life meaning.

“We’re not wealthy people,” she said. “We didn’t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, ‘Well, we’ll start selling cupcakes.’”

The Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It’s been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy.

“She sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,” Kefalis said. “He’s three months younger than Cal, so he should’ve been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again.”

Maria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She’s raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she’s hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States.

“Now, it’s just impatience,” Kefalis said. “Now it’s, like, ‘When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.’”

Until then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won.

Teichner asked Brad and Amy Price, “You keep using the word ‘miracle.’ In what way is all of this a miracle?”

“Our son’s still with us, and Cecilia as well,” they replied. “That’s the miracle.”

And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better.

That's what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center.

While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived.

Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life.

Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It's being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states.

""I put it on my phone yesterday,"" said DeMont's wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. ""He would not be here as we see him today.""

Seattle officials hope DeMont's story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it.

Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city's 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator.

About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events.

He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant.

""The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,"" Price said. ""The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.""

It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said.

It's not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient's outcome.

Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she'd ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions.

Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over.

""I hadn't responded to a cardiac arrest before,"" Forcade said. ""I thought, 'Did he just fall?' ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, 'Oh, man, who's going to step up?'""

He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said.

For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky.

story_reviews_00342,"Even if you’re not a big fan of seafood, you probably know that adding more fish to your diet can do a lot of good, from improving your heart health to lowering inflammation. Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.

The study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.

What she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.

“Based on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,” says Skaznik-Wikiel. “Our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.”

Exactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn’t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.

More studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats. (Some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s, but those cases are relatively rare.)

There may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well, in helping nerve development — that’s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats. “We hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes, omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go [for women hoping to get pregnant,]” she says. “But even without that firm answer at this point I don’t see the harm in supplementing.”

story_reviews_00343,"Story highlights Anti-cytokine drugs may treat depression in the future, researchers say

They are commonly prescribed to treat autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis

(CNN) In the future, a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs could be used to treat depression, say University of Cambridge researchers.

Drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen treat inflammation, the body's immune response to infections or pathogens. During an inflammatory response, immune cells flood the bloodstream with proteins known as cytokines.

Drugs to counteract these cytokines are the newest generation of anti-inflammatories. Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.

Based on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.

Twelve years ago, a car wreck took away Nathan Copeland's ability to control his hands or sense what his fingers were touching.

A few months ago, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center gave Copeland a new way to reach out and feel the world around him. It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.

The scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

""It's a really weird sensation,"" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. ""Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure."" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as ""natural.""

When Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.

""But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,"" Gaunt says.

The success represents an advance that is ""absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,"" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

McLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

For several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.

That makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.

Sensing Touch Watch a blindfolded Nathan Copeland accurately sense which finger's being touched.

""Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,"" he says.

Restoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.

""His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,"" Gaunt says. ""But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.""

So the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.

""We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,"" Gaunt says.

Next, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.

It was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. ""When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' "" Gaunt recalls. ""But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.""

Of course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.

Still, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, Oct. 14, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A multiple sclerosis drug usually reserved for people in the late stages of the disease seems to offer long-term remission in newly diagnosed patients, researchers report.

Because of serious side effects, the drug -- Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) -- is approved in the United States only for patients who have failed other treatments. But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.

""The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,"" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.

The treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.

Giovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system ""rebooter."" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.

During the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.

Also, when the immune system rebuilds itself, ""a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.

""But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said.

Still, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.

Lemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,"" Miskin said.

The decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. ""Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,"" Miskin said.

The new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.

MS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.

For this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.

The researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.

Moreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.

The findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.

Giovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.

""Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,"" he said.

According to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, ""Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.""

This study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. ""I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,"" Bebo said.

Giovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. ""If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible. In the European Union, it's recommended for early use,"" he noted.

The report was published online Oct. 12 in the journal Neurology.

story_reviews_00346,"The race to create the next potent ovarian cancer drug is coming to a head.

Ovarian cancer has historically been one of the harder cancers to treat — but a promising new class of drugs, called PARP inhibitors, is proving powerful in delaying the growth of tumors by preventing cancer cells from repairing themselves after they’ve been damaged by chemotherapy.

In recent days, the researchers behind three PARP drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Denmark.

advertisement

Massachusetts-based Tesaro was the clear front-runner with its experimental once-a-day ovarian cancer pill, niraparib. Its results built upon exciting data it released in June — showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman’s cancer doesn’t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)

A small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer (PFE), recently showed similarly compelling results.

But Colorado’s Clovis Oncology (CLVS) fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn’t measure up to the other two trials. The company’s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.

One PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca (AZN) as Lynparza. It’s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors — but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They’re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.

While chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they’ll keep cancer at bay once it’s been attacked by chemo.

A number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations — including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.

More and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.

The field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there’s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.

“We found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,” said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She’s launching a larger trial for further study.

As for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:

The study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn’t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.

The results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.

A few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro’s drug fast-track approval status — and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.

“In the field, these would be described as landmark results,” Moulder said. “At this time, there’s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.”

By comparison, Clovis Oncology has floundered.

The company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that’s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.

The study’s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can’t compare Clovis’s drug to Tesaro’s: “It’s a completely different population, and a different use of the drugs,” she said.

Because early symptoms are fairly benign — bloating and back pain — about 75 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer don’t learn they have it until it has progressed to stage 3. About 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and about 15,000 women die of the disease each year in the United States.",The race to create a new class of ovarian cancer drugs heats up,3,Cancer
story_reviews_00347,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker.

And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone.

Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment.

“Remember this day. It’s a new day for lung cancer treatment,” Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne’s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented.

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”.

The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected.

Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1.

Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.

Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”.

U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24.

Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO.

COMBINATION THERAPY

The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study.

Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low.

In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent.

Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.

Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.

Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.

They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market.

Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen.

The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.

These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.

The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.

Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.","'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo",3,Cancer

story_reviews_00349,"Ava Christianson, 8, has been battling cancer for half her life. Doctors hope a new, individualized immunotherapy treatment may now keep her in remission. (Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post)

By the time 8-year-old Ava Christianson got to the National Institutes of Health this summer, she had lost several grueling rounds to leukemia and was bracing for the next one.

Intensive chemotherapy, which cures up to 90 percent of children with the most common type of leukemia, hadn’t kept her cancer from coming back. Neither had a painful bone-marrow transplant nor an experimental treatment. Her careworn father cried in the shower to hide his anguish. Her mother couldn’t help but wonder, “Why is this happening to our child?”

But Ava was fortunate in one respect. Discoveries in the burgeoning field of immunotherapy are offering lifelines to desperate patients who previously had none. “Five years ago,” said her mother, Bethany Christianson, “our doctor would have just had to tell us to go home.”

Instead, in a five-minute procedure at the NIH Clinical Center in late July, the freckle-face girl got another chance to beat the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that has stalked her since age 4. She was infused with 30 million of her own T cells, a key part of the immune system, that had been genetically modified to track down and kill her cancer like a pack of crazed dogs.

Ava’s treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy, is one of the new immunotherapies that attempt to rally the body’s own defenses to fight malignancies. Unlike other cancer advances, it is being tested widely in children because of its stunning effectiveness in ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. In early-stage trials, many patients who had repeatedly relapsed saw their leukemia disappear. Some remain cancer-free.

Yet big questions surround the therapy, and many scientists are urging caution. “There’s very real promise with this approach, but the immune system is complicated,” said Terry Fry, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) scientist who is running Ava’s trial. “There’s a lot that still needs to be worked out.”

[Here’s what you need to know about immunotherapy]

Complications can be lethal; one clinical trial was briefly halted in July after three young adults died of brain swelling. It is also far from clear that such a personalized approach — possibly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars — is economically viable on a large scale or will produce the lasting remissions that everyone hopes to see.

U.S. researchers running CAR T-cell trials for children and adults with leukemia and lymphoma have reported remission rates up to 90 percent in some cases. That’s a major achievement in a group whose cancer is emboldened by every treatment failure. But rates in other trials are considerably lower, and many patients eventually relapse.

“The treatment is great about getting people into remission but not at keeping everyone in remission,” said Rebecca Gardner, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children’s hospital. She ran an early-stage trial using CAR T-cell therapy in which 39 of 42 patients went into complete remission. By a year, about half had relapsed, either because their T cells had inexplicably disappeared or their cancer had changed so that the T cells could no longer recognize it. “Leukemia is really smart,” she said.

Ava’s family understands that better than most. She underwent her first CAR T-cell procedure in Minnesota last year, but her leukemia returned within six months. Her treatment at NIH involved a next-generation version, developed by NCI, that used a different target for her marauding T cells. In this first-in-humans trial, she is Patient No. 18.

In late August, the Christiansons learned that Ava had gone into remission. She and her mother, who were still at the Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., gleefully rushed home to Wisconsin so Ava could start third grade.

Her parents, so frequently disappointed, remain guardedly optimistic. “Hope is all you have,” said her father, Jay Christianson.

Her mother added, “We just need this to work and to stay working.”

NCI’s Fry is careful not to make any promises about an extended remission. “I can’t say that’s going to be the case,” he said, “because we just don’t know. It’s too soon.”

Scientists have wanted for decades to marshal the immune system to vanquish cancer, but their attempts have mostly been frustrated. In the past few years, however, breakthroughs have led to the development of two types of immunotherapy — checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T cells — that are generating enormous excitement.

Checkpoint inhibitors are off-the-shelf therapies aimed at unleashing the immune system’s power to see and attack the disease. Used mostly in adults, to date, they are producing impressive results, albeit in a minority of cases. The most prominent: Jimmy Carter. The former president became the poster patient when he was successfully treated last year with a checkpoint inhibitor called Keytruda, along with surgery and radiation, for his advanced melanoma.

Much of the earliest research for customized CAR T-cell therapy was conducted at NCI, the University of Pennsylvania, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Seattle Children’s.

“The technology of CAR T cells is really a breakthrough, especially for children,” said Michael Jensen, director of the Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research at Seattle Children’s Research Institute.

Almost all the initial work focused on CD19, a protein found on the surface of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Scientists figured out ways to use a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, to reprogram T cells to recognize the protein and kill the cancer.

[Immunotherapy is showing benefits in an increasing number of cancers]

Zane Esposito, a 13-year-old from Plano, Tex., calls himself the “T-Cell Explorer.” He was diagnosed with ALL in June 2010. “I just thought my back hurt,” he said. “I couldn’t walk up the steps very well.” Almost three years of treatment, including punishing chemotherapy, provided a couple of years of remission. His leukemia returned in January, and this time it did not respond to treatment.

Soon after Zane relapsed, he and his father bumped into friends in a local doughnut shop who told them about a TV segment on CAR T-cell therapy. Paul Esposito searched online and found Gardner’s clinical trial in Seattle. Zane signed on, got the treatment, went back into full remission and gained 25 pounds.

His Texas doctors have talked about a bone-marrow transplant to increase the chance of a true cure, but the Espositos have resisted. The Seattle doctors say it is not clear yet whether that is necessary or whether there would be still other options should Zane’s cancer recur.

Zane is moving on, with dreams of competing on “Chopped Junior” to show off his homemade pasta and pizza. On July 27, the day that Ava got her T cells, he celebrated his 13th birthday.

Ava was 4 when she started having leg pains, then trouble standing up. Her mother suspected Lyme disease. “You never think of cancer with a child,” she said, eyes filling as she recalled her daughter’s cancer diagnosis in November 2012. The doctors assured the family that it was typical leukemia — and curable.

Like most children, Ava quickly went into remission after starting the prescribed 30 months of chemotherapy. But at home in Prescott, a small Wisconsin city at the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers, things did not get easier for the Christiansons. In early 2013, Ava was hospitalized in Minneapolis for a lung infection. About the same time, the couple’s second daughter, Audrey, was born 13 weeks premature and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit in St. Paul. Bethany, who manages occupational therapists for a nursing-home chain, and Jay, a rural mail carrier, shuttled between the Twin Cities visiting their daughters.

“I would be with Ava during the day, and then when Jay got home, he would stay with Ava, and I would spend time with Audrey,” she said. “No matter what you do, you feel like a bad mom.”

A year or so after treatment began, Ava relapsed. Now she was in a much more dangerous category: children whose leukemia no longer responds to chemo. Her doctors arranged for a bone-marrow transplant, with her baby sister as the donor.

The transplant made her sick and the whole family miserable. Ava spent months in the hospital and then a year at home. Because of fears of infection, she couldn’t go out much. She missed all of first grade. But her parents had hope that the transplant would keep her cancer at bay.

[Brain cancer now the leading cause of cancer deaths in children]

At a six-month checkup, tests showed that the leukemia was back again. There were no more conventional treatments to try. But because of her two relapses, Ava was now eligible for a CAR T-cell trial at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital. Her T cells would be genetically altered to go after CD19.The number of cells then would be vastly increased and reinfused.

It sounded like science fiction, but Bethany Christianson found comfort in talking to the father of Emily Whitehead. In 2012, the 6-year-old Pennsylvania girl became the first child to be treated with reprogrammed T cells for leukemia. She has been in remission ever since.

Ava got her treatment in April 2015 — after her cells were extracted via a tube inserted into her neck — and five days later had a massive immune reaction with a high fever and intense pain. While that is typical, some patients become dangerously ill. Yet Ava recovered fast, went into remission and attended summer school, where she learned how to make pigs-in-a-blanket and wrote her own cookbook.

By then, her parents had gotten used to living in the midst of remissions and relapses. “When she felt better, we would do everything we could,” Bethany said. They visited Robot World, a scientifically themed attraction a few hours from Prescott. “You don’t put things off, because you are always thinking, ‘What if?’ ”

Last fall, doctors delivered the bad news. Ava’s cancer had changed. It was no longer producing the CD19 protein, which meant her modified T cells could no longer recognize the disease. But the leukemia was still producing another common protein, called CD22, and that offered an opportunity.

As it happened, Fry, head of the blood-cancer section in NCI’s pediatric oncology branch, had already launched the world’s first trial using CAR T-cell therapy to focus on CD22. It seemed an equally promising target that could broaden the therapy’s impact, researchers thought. At the time, they did not realize that a significant percentage of patients in the other trials might relapse because of changes in their cancer.

Fry insisted as he designed the study that children be included, despite ever-present concerns about exposing them to safety risks. He wanted to avoid a delay in testing what could be a lifesaving pediatric treatment. “I didn’t want to take two to three years on adults, and then go back and do children,” he said.

The clinical trial already has treated nearly two dozen leukemia and lymphoma patients through age 30. The majority have gone into remission, although some have had their cancer return. While it is far too early to know long-term outcomes, Fry said he is convinced the CD22 treatment holds much potential. He is planning another trial next year with the Stanford University School of Medicine. It will target both proteins — CD19 and CD22 — simultaneously.

Once Ava relapsed after the Minnesota trial, Fry’s study at the NIH Clinical Center appeared to be the only option. But there was no slot immediately available. With Ava deteriorating, doctors put her on an experimental treatment that sent her into remission but had serious side effects.

They immediately stopped the medication when they learned Ava might get her T-cell therapy in January — she actually needed a high level of leukemia in her body to participate. But on this wrenching roller coaster of research and treatment, it turned out that she still had to wait several more months.

Ava’s cancer returned in June. Her T cells were extracted in preparation for the trial, even as she got sicker and sicker.

She was admitted to the Clinical Center in mid-July, to a room with dancing penguins painted on the windows. The day before her therapy, an ebullient Audrey burst into the room and the two sisters ran down the hall to a play space.

Her mother was ready this time for the intense immune reaction that followed treatment, although she still found it hard to watch Ava spike a fever of 106. “When you see that temperature on the thermometer, every bone in your body says it’s wrong to let it get that high,” Bethany said. “Then suddenly it’s over.”

If his daughter’s cancer returns yet again, “I have no idea what we’ll do,” Jay said. “We’re kind of up against the edge.”

Fry thinks she might be able to undergo a second round of her latest immunotherapy, as long as her cancer is still producing CD22 proteins. Doctors in Minnesota also might recommend a second bone-marrow transplant — something her parents dread, saying it was the roughest treatment of all.

For now, Ava is happily back in school. “I just want her to be a kid,” Bethany Christianson said. “She has missed out on a lot of that.”",This 8-year-old is free of cancer — for now — after a ‘breakthrough’ treatment,5,Washington Post
story_reviews_00350,"Actress Marisa Tomei is one of among an estimated 5 million Americans who suffers from chronic dry eye (CDE), a condition that can cause symptoms such as itchiness, stinging, difficulty making tears and blurred vision. To raise awareness about CDE and help other people find relief, the “My Cousin Vinny” and “The Wrestler” star has teamed up with pharmaceutical company Allergan and Guide Dogs for the Blind, an organization that trains dogs and pairs them with visually impaired individuals.

After toting around eye drops, Tomei said she has found a solution with Allergan’s prescription drug RESTASIS®, which works by increasing the eyes’ natural ability to produce tears. CDE causes inflammation that can prevent tear production, according to Allergan.

Sometimes, individuals with CDE have trouble opening their eyes, but Tomei said she went to the doctor and reported mild but incessant itchiness and dryness, and was diagnosed with CDE.

She turned to RESTASIS® because she didn’t want to keep worrying about constantly using eye drops.

“It was as simple as going to the doctor, getting a prescription and trying RESTASIS®,” Tomei, 51, who stars in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Homecoming” movie, told FoxNews.com.

She decided to partner with Allergan not only because she found the prescription improved her quality of life but also because of the company’s relationship with Guide Dogs for the Blind. On Restasis.com, you can take the brand’s “dry eye quiz”— for every quiz taken, Allergan has agreed to donate $1 to the organization. When you visit the website, you’ll see a pop-up window with a portal to take the quiz.

Tomei, a self-proclaimed animal lover, expressed that the effort is close to her heart.

“A whole world of freedom opens up [for these individuals] because you can move about a city like this (New York City) or anywhere much more easily, and the dogs can become your eyes,” she said.

The quiz on Restasis.com can help individuals learn whether they’re a candidate for the drug. If you think you may be suffering from CDE, Tomei advised visiting your doctor to receive a diagnosis.

People who have reached their later years may think it's primarily a time to relax, not to increase their physical activity. Not so. Previous research has suggested that exercise can improve memory and reverse muscle loss in older adults, among other benefits. And a study out Monday finds that a regular program of physical activity reduces the time spent with mobility-limiting disability.

Researchers took more than 1,600 sedentary people between 70 and 89 years old who had some functional limitations, but who could walk about a quarter of a mile in 15 minutes or less, unassisted by another person or a walker. (Canes were OK.)

Half of the participants got a health education program involving regular in-person sessions and some stretching exercises, while the other group was told to aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity as well as strength, flexibility and balance training both at the study's facilities and at home. ""Walking was the cornerstone of the program,"" says Thomas Gill, a professor of geriatrics at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the study, which appears in Annals of Internal Medicine.

The study followed participants for about 2.7 years, and found that the physical activity program cut the amount of time that people spent with a ""major mobility disability"" — defined as being unable to walk a quarter mile — by 25 percent compared to the education program. Previous findings from the same study showed that the exercise program lowered the risk of becoming disabled in the first place; this one showed that it sped recovery from an episode of disability and lowered the risk of subsequent episodes.

""They've done a really nice job of showing the incredible power of physical activity,"" says Bradley Cardinal, a professor of kinesiology at Oregon State University who wasn't involved with the study. ""It's the secret ingredient to successful aging in terms of quality of life."" An editorial accompanying the study, by the University of California, San Francisco's Patricia Katz and the University of South Carolina's Russell Pate, also noted that people who engage in physical activity have a lower risk for heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, depression, cognitive impairment and functional decline.

The exercise program pretty closely followed the government's recommendations for all adults, including older ones: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, plus two strength sessions that hit all the major muscle groups.

But most Americans don't get that much exercise, and that becomes increasingly true as people age. According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 28 percent of those 75 and up meet the recommendation for aerobic activity, and only 8 percent also did the suggested amount of strength training.

Cardinal says older adults need to realize that exercise can greatly improve their quality of life by maximizing function as long as possible. But he says that many believe that older age is for relaxing and that physical activity is somehow dangerous or unnatural. That belief ""is pervasive among older adults,"" he says, even though for many of them, meeting the minimum requirements ""is doable.""

Semantics can help. ""We try to frame this as more physical activity than exercise,"" says Gill. ""We talk with older folks and many say, 'I can't exercise, but maybe I can become more physically active.' "" Study participants were advised to ""start low and go slow,"" and some were even able to get rid of their canes after six months of exercise, which Gill says they found particularly rewarding.

Physicians can also help. ""Prescribing exercise may be just as important as prescribing medications — perhaps even more important in some cases,"" the editorial said. The authors called on medical schools to ""start preparing students to prescribe exercise as effectively as they prescribe statins, and for health systems to support physicians in addressing inactivity just as they provide support in addressing other health risks."" (The American College of Sports Medicine has an ""Exercise is Medicine"" initiative to help physicians integrate exercise recommendations into their treatment plans.)

There are also some basic behavioral strategies for getting yourself to get moving, no matter your age, including giving yourself an incentive to change and engineering your environment to encourage the activity.

story_reviews_00354,"The window for helping certain stroke patients with a potentially life-saving blood clot removal surgical treatment may be longer than previously thought, according to a study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Traditionally stroke is treated with medications that stabilize or diminish blood clots in the brain. In select patients surgical intervention to remove the clot may be possible to mitigate effects of the stroke.

Currently, the American Stroke Association advises that blood clot removal for some patients -- an emergency procedure called endovascular thrombectomy recently developed and increasingly used in addition to medical therapies -- should be done within six hours after stroke symptoms to lower the amount of disability patients will face later. But this analysis showed that the time for treatment could be slightly longer -- up to 7.3 hours.

This study could affect the current guidelines on treating stroke patients, according to Dr. Cathy Sila, Director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. She said there is ""compelling rationale to move that window a little bit.""

As a result of having lost blood flow to the brain for an extended time, stroke victims often suffer physical disabilities and lose varying degrees of their independence. They often require longer-term care and therapies.

""Long-term disability of stroke is more expensive than cost of hospitalization,"" Sila told ABC News today.

Authors from multiple institutions including the University of Calgary, pooled data from five studies on stroke treatments to see if providing endovascular thrombectomy in addition to standard medical treatment past six hours would help patients. They analyzed those studies for patients who have had large blood vessel strokes, seeking to understand how much of an effect blood clot removal surgery performed after six hours would have on their longer-term recovery. They used a benchmark of three months after the stroke to assess patients' level of disability.

In total, 1,287 patients were enrolled in the five trials studied. The researchers examined clinical data and brain imaging in addition to the patients’ physical function. They found that the patients who received standard medical therapy along with an endovascular thrombectomy up to 7.3 hours after developing stroke symptoms were less likely than patients who were treated with only medications to report disability three months later.

When they examined the patients three months after the stroke, each hour delay in receiving the treatment corresponded in worse outcomes for the patients, including more severe disability and less functional independence.

This meant that even the patients who received the treatment outside of the generally accepted 6 hours cut off up to the 7.3 hours point tended to report less disability during their recovery. However, if people received the treatment after 7.3 hours from onset of symptoms there was no statistical improvement.

Dr. Mayank Goyal, a co-author of the study and professor of Radiology, University of Calgary, said he hopes the study will help raise awareness about the importance of getting prompt treatment for a stroke and having an efficient system to provide this procedure.

""Time is brain,"" Goyal told ABC News. ""The faster we can re-establish blood flow to brain, the higher the likelihood of the patients having a good outcome and going back to independent living.""

Sila said further study is needed to find out if these kinds of procedures could benefit people even after the 7.3 hours from symptom onset. She pointed out that these studies are important since they can help change guidelines and push insurance companies to cover the procedure for more patients.

""We need to have this kind of data so third party payers would have it to base [costs] on,"" she said.

story_reviews_00355,"Artist Lorie Novak in front of work from her Migraine Register project, which documents all the time she's lost to debilitating migraines.

It often starts with the aura.

Zig-zagging lines come into view, everyday light becomes searingly bright, and vision starts to slip. These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.

“It’s like you’re possessed,” said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. “I almost feel separate from my body, like it’s just this painful shell around me that’s not me.”

advertisement

Novak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.

But that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.

The new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven’t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they’re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.

And thus four drug makers — Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals — have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.

So far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they’re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It’s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.

Each treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.

So far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.

“There will certainly be hypercompetition,” said William Ratner, Lilly’s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies’ fortunes are intertwined, he said, and “the class only wins if headache care in America improves.”

Aiming to prevent migraines before they start

There’s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative.

“I’m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,” said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein’s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.

With the “exquisite sensitivity” of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.

Because antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck’s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)

“So in some senses, it’s a paradigm shift,” Schatzman said.

But there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be “the Holy Grail of personalized medicine,” said Rob Lenz, Amgen’s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.

And long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they’ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.

‘I felt like my life was being stolen from me’

Any advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.

Bates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn’t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.

“The pain is more than anything I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve run on broken legs before,” she said. “I felt like my life was being stolen from me.”

Collectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.

Yet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.

It’s a “subjective symptom that predominantly affects women,” said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. “That’s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.”

Novak, a professor of photography at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that’s more than 120 pictures.

The idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years.

“That for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,” Novak said, “of how much time I lose.”",The drug industry might finally have an answer for migraines,2,STAT
story_reviews_00356,"Cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate, but a new crop of nuclear-imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment.

The tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level. The ability to accurately locate the cancers helps physicians make better and earlier diagnoses—and may eventually make possible targeted nuclear-medicine therapies that identify and kill cancer cells, but not the surrounding healthy cells.

This summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved two such tests—one can trace slow-growing prostate cancer cells, while the other targets a rare condition where neuroendocrine cells develop into tumors. Advanced Accelerator Applications, a French pharmaceutical company that developed the test for neuroendocrine tumors, also is seeking approval for a drug called Lutathera that uses the same technique to zero in on the cancer that needs treating, says Chief Executive Stefano Buono.

Finding the fuel

Developed in the 1970s, nuclear imaging is used to reveal the body’s metabolic activities (in contrast with static imaging, such as X-rays, which provide just a snapshot). Positron emission tomography, or PET, scans can be used to identify many common cancers, as well as Alzheimer’s and epilepsy.

But many PET scans aren’t effective at locating certain cancers, including cancer of the prostate, the third most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 180,000 new cases and more than 26,000 deaths expected this year. That’s because the most common imaging agent, known as FDG, uses glucose to locate cancer cells. Prostate and several other cancers don’t use as much glucose, so the scans aren’t effective for those diseases.

The new tests pair radioactive materials with a receptor that reacts to a hormone for neuroendocrine tumors or, in the case of prostate cancer, amino acid, which is what fuels the disease. The result is a better view of the cancer.

Spotting a relapse

Blue Earth Diagnostics Ltd., based in Oxford, England, developed the prostate imaging agent, called Axumin, based on a molecule originally developed by Mark Goodman, a professor of radiology and imaging sciences at Emory University’s School of Medicine in the mid-1990s. The agent was administered commercially for the first time in September at a hospital in Atlanta.

With recurrent prostate cancer, the test’s ability to locate cancer at the cellular level means that it can complement current diagnostic tests.

Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is the common way to screen for the disease. But it isn’t entirely reliable because the PSA protein count also rises with age and disease of the prostate like inflammation, and it doesn’t help to determine the location of the tumor. That can be crucial in deciding on treatment. If the cancer is confined to the pelvis, surgery or radiation can be used to treat the disease. But if it has spread to lymph nodes or the bones, hormone therapy may be required.

The test also allows for earlier detection of recurrent disease. An estimated 20% to 30% of men who are treated for prostate cancer will relapse after five years, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

“The new scan can detect cancer with a relatively low PSA count, say, under 5, when the cancer may still be curable,” says Mark Scholz, founder and executive director of the non-profit Prostate Cancer Research Institute. “That changes everything.”

There are other efforts seeking to screen for cancer on a cellular level. Genetic testing, for example, looks for inherited mutations in a person’s genes to gauge the risk of developing hereditary cancer, and allow patients to be on guard even before any symptoms appear. Still, nuclear imaging can provide complementary information to these newer methods. For one, nuclear imaging can see how the tumor behaves in the body and its immediate environment and can be used to inform physicians about changes in the disease during the course of treatment, says Dr. Janet Eary, a deputy associate director at the National Cancer Institute’s cancer-imaging program.

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- New guidelines issued by three leading cancer organizations suggest that more breast cancer patients should consider radiation therapy after a mastectomy.

Overall, the guidelines say there's enough evidence to show radiation treatment after a mastectomy decreases the risk of breast cancer recurrence, and that even women with smaller tumors and three or fewer lymph nodes involved can benefit from the therapy.

""The new guidelines say there is clear evidence that the benefit of [post-mastectomy radiation therapy] extends to women with limited lymph node involvement,"" said Dr. Stephen Edge. He is vice president for health care outcomes and policy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Edge was co-chair of the panel that developed the new guidelines.

One radiation treatment expert welcomed the updated recommendations.

""The guideline is timely,"" said Dr. Janna Andrews, an attending physician in radiation medicine at Norwell Health Cancer Institute, in Lake Success, N.Y. ""The field of post-mastectomy radiation is changing. It's always up for discussion now as to who needs [post-mastectomy radiation therapy].""

The new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. ""In the past, if a woman had a small tumor, less than 5 centimeters, and not more than three or four positive lymph nodes, many doctors would say she does not need [post-mastectomy radiation therapy],"" she said.

The guidelines don't offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. But they do focus on the group of women for whom there is the most debate about the value of radiation.

""There is a great deal of controversy about whether women with one, two or three lymph nodes [with cancer] have sufficient risk to warrant radiation,"" he said. ""For women with four or more lymph nodes involved, everyone would recommend radiation.""

The guidelines also strongly support input from all specialists who treat breast cancer in making the decision about radiation treatment. That typically includes the surgeon, radiation physician and an oncologist.

Doctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Side effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction, he explained.

Edge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. For instance, he explained, ''a woman 65 who has microscopic involvement in a single lymph node and an estrogen-receptor positive cancer would be very different from a 38-year-old who has three lymph nodes involved and so-called triple-negative breast cancer."" The younger woman, he said, would typically be advised to get radiation.

The older woman, because her risk is lower, should have a discussion with her doctor to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk, Edge noted.

Andrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team. If a woman's doctor tells her she does not need radiation after a mastectomy, the woman should be told why and she should ask if the radiation oncologist weighed in on the decision.

Edge was a panel representative from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which created the guidelines along with the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology.

All three groups published the guidelines online this week in their respective journals: the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Practical Radiation Oncology and the Annals of Surgical Oncology.

story_reviews_00358,"When babies eat certain foods early in life—the kinds so many end up allergic to, like eggs and peanuts—they’re less likely to develop allergies to those foods later on, finds a new analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

This is relatively new thinking. Not so long ago, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that allergenic foods be kept away from infants until they were at least a year old, and often older. That warning was especially strong for those with a family history of allergies. But, as an editorial published in the same issue of JAMA points out, in the next decade, food allergy prevalence nearly doubled in the United States.

That advice has been amended, and newer evidence has shown that introducing foods earlier is actually better for preventing food allergies. The authors of the just-published study reviewed all of the available evidence on the topic and included 146 studies in their final analysis.

Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now

They found evidence of “moderate certainty” that introducing peanuts early, between ages 4 and 11 months, is linked to a reduction in the risk of developing a peanut allergy. Eggs, too, showed this association when they were introduced between ages 4 and 6 months. Early introduction of another common allergen, fish, was also linked to less allergy—possibly due to the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3s—though evidence for this link wasn’t as certain.

Early introduction didn’t seem to make a difference for autoimmune diseases, at least according to the available evidence; eating gluten young wasn’t associated with the risk of developing celiac disease.

Exactly why is a question researchers are still exploring. “It is not clear that it is the specific early introduction of an allergenic food that renders immunological protection, rather than the accompanying increased diversity in the diet that occurs as a by-product,” writes Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, an allergy and immunology specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, in the accompanying editorial. More research is necessary to figure out the ideal amounts of these allergens, the optimum times of introduction and the reasons behind the link.

story_reviews_00359,"LONDON (Reuters) - Exposure to bright light can raise testosterone levels and lead to greater sexual satisfaction in men with low sexual desire, according to the results of a small scientific trial.

Scientists at the University of Siena in Italy found that regular, early-morning use of a light box – similar to those used to combat Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD - helped men increase testosterone and improved their sex lives.

Andrea Fagiolini, a professor who led the study and presented it at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference in Vienna on Monday, said the treatment may prove useful during the Northern hemisphere’s darker winter months.

“The increased levels of testosterone explain the greater reported sexual satisfaction,” he said. “In the Northern hemisphere, the body’s testosterone production naturally declines from November through April, and then rises steadily through the spring and summer with a peak in October.”

Low sexual desire can affect significant numbers of men after the age of 40, with studies finding that up to 25 percent of men report problems.

Fagiolini’s team recruited 38 men diagnosed with either hypoactive sexual desire disorder or sexual arousal disorder – both characterized by a lack of interest in sex.

After taking baseline readings, they divided the men into two groups and gave one regular treatment with a bright light box, while the control, or placebo, group was treated with a light box adapted to give out significantly less light.

“We found fairly significant differences,” Fagiolini said.

“Before treatment, both groups averaged a sexual satisfaction score of around 2 out of 10. But after treatment, the group exposed to the bright light was scoring sexual satisfaction scores of around 6.3. In contrast, the control group only showed an average score of around 2.7 after treatment.”",Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido,2,Reuters
story_reviews_00360,"An inhaler that protects the lungs against air pollution has been developed by scientists and could help the many millions of people affected by toxic air to avoid its worst effects.

The inhaler delivers a molecule, first found in bacteria in the Egyptian desert, which stabilises water on the surface of the lung cells to form a protective layer. It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.

Outdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.

The impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a “public health emergency”.

But the government’s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.

Vehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.

Action to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.

“It is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,” said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. “It supports the natural barrier.”

When inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: “Damage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.”

The inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.

Ectoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of £17 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.

Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.”

The protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.

“The point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established – there is no more doubt,” Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: “Personally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.”

Dr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: “Ectoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.”

“The work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,” he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. “It could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.”

Krutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. “It is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don’t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.”

“It will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,” he said.",New inhaler protects lungs against effects of air pollution,3,The Guardian

story_reviews_00362,"Inside the brightly lit storefront in Brooklyn, N.Y., business was brisk as employees combed, washed and blow-dried little heads.

“Do I have a lot of lice?” a boy asks the woman combing his hair slathered in Pantene conditioner.

It’s the busiest time of the year for companies like Lice Busters, a family-run business Dalya Harel started in her kitchen in 1989. She now has eight locations in New York, Florida and Israel. The Brooklyn salon, opened in April, has big boxes of lollipops and Twizzlers. Cartoons playing on a TV screen are interrupted by the constant ring of the phone and chatter of schoolchildren. A lice check at a local private school one day last week had brought a steady stream of business.

Some six million to 12 million infestations of head lice occur each year in the U.S. in children ages 3 to 11 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite experts’ assurances that head lice pose no health concern, the insects are a regular source of angst for schools and families, who may spend as much as hundreds of dollars to get rid of them.

Lice have become increasingly resistant to widely used over-the-counter shampoos such as Nix or Rid, which contain permethrin or pyrethrins. While such products are still recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups as the first line of treatment, some doctors and parents are turning to new topical treatments, which are generally available by prescription. Also getting a boost are combing salons, some of which have expanded into multistate chains.

“The process of combing out is the only way to get rid of all the lice and nits,” says Deborah Capone, who calls in Lice Busters’ employees when there is a lice outbreak at the three preschools she runs in Brooklyn.

The salons typically use a technique known as wet combing. Hair is doused in some sort of lubricant—often Pantene conditioner—and employees use a specially designed comb to remove the lice and nits. The conditioner loosens the pests and makes them easier to spot. The process can take more than an hour as hair is combed multiple times from different angles.

Lice Busters’ Ms. Harel says her two New York locations charge $20 for an initial check and $150 to $250 for a treatment, depending on hair length and how severe the infestation is. A recheck a week later is another $20. Employees also do house calls.

Customers at the Brooklyn salon say they come there to avoid applying chemicals on their children’s heads. “We can leave here relieved,” says one mom.

There are close to 1,000 lice-removal companies in the U.S. today, says Katie Shepherd, founder and chief executive of the Shepherd Institute for Lice Solutions, a nonprofit in West Palm Beach, Fla., that trains people who want to start a lice-combing business. By comparison, there were 42 such companies in 2009 when she published a book that detailed her method of nit removal. Ms. Shepherd also heads a company that tests lice products and she operates three lice-combing salons.

Some experts criticize lice-combing businesses because they aren’t regulated. People who work in the salons tend to have no particular training in pest control or entomology, says Richard J. Pollack, a senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University. And most aren’t able to distinguish between debris and dandruff, and between a nit, a louse and some other kind of bug, says Dr. Pollack, who also runs a consulting business called IdentifyUS LLC that identifies bug specimens, mainly bed bugs and ticks, and offers guidance on managing pest problems.

Newer prescription treatments have been shown to be safe and effective, and to have no serious side effects, according to an article published online in the journal Pediatric Dermatology last week that reviewed studies of the products. The effectiveness of traditional over-the-counter shampoos has dropped to about 25% from nearly 100% two decades ago, the researchers say. “Widespread and indiscriminate use” of the traditional products and mutations in lice made them resistant to the insecticides, they say.

The prescription products include benzyl alcohol, sold under the brand name Ulesfia; ivermectin, or Sklice; malathion, or Ovide lotion; and spinosad, sold as Natroba. The medications have been found to be from 68% to 87% effective after one or two applications. Most don’t require combing.

The review article’s authors, some of whom have consulted with pharmaceutical companies, also say there is no evidence for the effectiveness of some popular home remedies for lice, including dousing the hair in olive oil, petroleum jelly, mayonnaise or essential oils, practices that could also be unsafe.

“We thought it was time to review some of these newer products so people would understand what control options they have,” says John Clark, a professor of environmental toxicology and chemistry at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a co-author on the study.

Having multiple treatment options is important to help prevent the rapid development of resistance again, says Dr. Clark, whose research has documented the development of the mutations in lice believed to have contributed to their resistance to over-the-counter treatments. Dr. Clark says he has worked as a consultant for some of the companies that developed the prescription treatments, but has no current active research projects.

“My guidance would be that the first step should be to contact a physician and ask for a visit and prescription,” says William Ryan, another co-author on the Pediatric Dermatology article. Dr. Ryan says he previously ran the development program for the company that created Sklice. He works as a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry but isn’t currenlty working for any companies with lice products.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and some other medical associations, including the National Association of School Nurses, still recommend OTC shampoos as the first line of treatment for lice unless resistance has been documented in a community.

The OTC treatments sometimes don’t seem to work because the lice diagnosis wasn’t accurate or the products aren’t used properly or the patient became reinfected, says Dawn Nolt, clinical associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, Ore.

While the prescription drugs are effective, they are more expensive, says Dr. Nolt, who is on the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that developed last year’s updated lice recommendations. Prescription lice medications can cost as much as $300 and aren’t always covered by insurance.

Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City, Mo., recommends parents first try the over-the-counter lice treatments because they are inexpensive and will still work in certain regions of the country. If those aren’t effective after one or two days, she suggests a prescription medication or occasionally oral antibiotics in combination with an OTC treatment.

“Some parents don’t like to do the prescriptions because they think it’s more chemicals on their kid’s skin,” Dr. Burgert says. As for a combing salon, “It’s a nice option and it certainly gets the job done. It’s just very, very tedious.”

story_reviews_00363,"The Michigan High School Athletic Association says its unique sideline concussion testing program for athletes in football and other sports is having a positive impact, though long-term funding is an issue as it heads into its second and final year.

Member schools in the pilot program removed players for possible concussions at a higher rate than schools that were not, Executive Director Jack Roberts said.

""They're proving that they're good, but people are going to have to respond with support locally,"" Roberts said. ""We cannot sustain this forever.""

His group on Monday released results of its first-ever head-injury survey of more than 750 member high schools from 2015-2016 sports. It received data from nearly every school.

The association started the program last fall with 62 high schools. It includes baseline testing of athletes in football and other sports to help with concussion diagnosis.

The association spent $10,000 last school year to start the program. It expects to spend $30,000 this year but will have fewer schools — 34 — involved because of the expense and commitment. They will also concentrate on sports that have the highest incidence of head injury.

""I hope that we can demonstrate their value and encourage sponsorship, grant support,"" Roberts said. ""But it's going to take I think some investment by the people in the communities. The moms and dads are going to have to think that this is important and worth to contributing to make the programs safer for their children.""

Here is some information on what's happening in Michigan:

WHAT IS BASELINE TESTING

Baseline testing is a combination of memory, reaction time, attention and stress assessments. It is done in major pro sports because it is considered an objective and individualized tool to help decide whether to remove an athlete from a game. While all states have laws that address preventing concussions in youth sports, many are weak and none require baseline testing.

WHY IT MATTERS

Michigan schools reported 4,452 head injuries in boys and girls sport, or 5.9 per school. Contact sports had the most head injuries. Ranking first was 11-player football with 49 head injuries per 1,000 participants, followed by ice hockey with 38 and 8-player football with 34. Girls soccer had 30 injuries per 1,000 participants, and girls basketball ranked fifth with 29 injuries per 1,000.

But that is likely only part of the picture. Health and safety advocates fear concussions often go undetected in high schools because of inconsistent protocols at districts unwilling or unable to spend money for detection. It's often on players to self-report concussions, or on coaches, who have many responsibilities and sometimes little training, to recognize symptoms.

WHY NOT ALL SCHOOLS

Schools typically don't argue with the benefit of testing, but cash-strapped districts often say the cost of offering such programs is prohibitive.

PROGRAMS AVAILABLE

Many sideline concussion-testing programs are on the market. Michigan is testing the Illinois-based King-Devick Test affiliated with the Mayo Clinic and Maryland-based XLNTbrain Sport. The association provides them for free to the participating schools. Long term, Roberts thinks the association could fund it in part with a $3 to $5 fee per student. But the association is also working to get grants.

HOW IT WORKS

Baselines with the XLNTbrain Sport are determined during 30-minute sessions by athletes at computers. The tests measure reaction time, attention, memory and stress by completing a series of exercises that involve such things as word recognition. Athletes suspected of a head injury undergo a sideline assessment done in about five minutes with an iPhone or tablet app. It assesses memory by providing words for the athlete to remember. It asks questions that require the athlete to recall the hit. The athletes also hold the phone as they stand for 20 seconds with eyes open and then closed to check balance. That assessment is compared to the athlete's baseline data to help determine whether they can return to play.

WHAT'S NEXT IN MICHIGAN

Roberts hopes that universities, health care systems and the National Federation of State High School Associations will help analyze the data from last year and this year. The association plans specifically to work with Michigan State University's Institute for the Study of Youth Sports to explore possible changes and additions in coaches' education.

story_reviews_00364,"From the Jewish schvitz to Mesoamerican “houses of heat,” people all over the world have long associated a good sweat with a wide assortment of health benefits. And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas.

One long-term study of middle-aged Finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna 2-3 days a week enjoyed a 23% drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently.

“Sauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood pressure,” says Dr. Ernst van der Wall, chief of cardiology at the Netherlands Leiden University Medical Centre.

In a recent editorial appearing in the Netherlands Heart Journal, van der Wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages. He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. “Death in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,” he writes.

Still, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing’s safety have always centered on its occupant’s (and her heart’s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.

Infrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.

“As infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,” says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.

While there’s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there’s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.

People who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a “room-temperature” space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart’s vessels.

Beever’s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas—including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.

Beever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing—infrared or otherwise.

But he also points out that no accidents or adverse reactions occurred in any of the studies he reviewed. (For men hoping to father children, spending time in hot saunas or baths has long been a no-no. Healthy sperm and heat don’t play well together. Beever says infrared heat may damage sperm as do other forms of heat, but at this point there’s no data on those risks.)

So what to think of infrared saunas? The existing evidence, though scanty, suggests spending up to 15 minutes a day in one could benefit your heart and ease symptoms associated with chronic pain. And, for now, there don’t seem to be any significant health risks.

Ask your doctor first. But if you’re wondering whether an infrared sauna is worth a try, the evidence suggests you have little to lose and possibly something to gain by checking one out.

story_reviews_00365,"Jessie Quinn — here with daughter Luna Williams — has been cancer-free for five years, thanks to a transplant of stem cells from a baby’s umbilical cord. (Courtesy of Jessie Quinn)

Jessie Quinn of Sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite, weight loss, some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010. Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia — a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly — and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.

Quinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.

In fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.

“I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,” Quinn said.

While searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby’s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.

This therapy and another — haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient — have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.

“Many patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,” said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.

A dangerous process

Bone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person’s immune system.

The transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient’s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.

The process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.

In the past, a patient’s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven’t been exposed to much life — such as bacteria and viruses — and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren’t a perfect match.

When Quinn’s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.

Caption From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here’s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Doctors were stumped by this 2-year-old boy’s symptoms. He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.

Because each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.

This expanded cord-blood technique has been a “huge home run” for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.

“No one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,” she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.

“This is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,” Delaney said. “We can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.”

Quinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.

She remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.

“It still gives me pause — I went to Costa Rica — that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,” Quinn says. “I was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It’s an indescribable feeling.”

In haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient’s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.

‘Everybody now has a donor’

“Parents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,” Jones said. “Siblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.”

Yet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.

“Despite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,” Jones said. “There are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.”

Jones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 — primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia — but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.

Gregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.

His wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease — acute myeloid leukemia — as doctors discussed treatment with them.

“We knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,” Caryn Gordon said. “He decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, ‘Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.’ ”

On advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.

“We thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,” Caryn recalled.

According to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient’s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.

But Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney’s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.

Not everyone is as lucky. Quinn, Gordon and 11 other participants in Delaney’s clinical trial “are all alive, in remission, at a median age of about 4.7 years,” the researcher said, but two patients died when the disease relapsed.

A larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway.

story_reviews_00366,"Whether you call it water running, aqua jogging or hydrotherapy, you can’t beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits, many experts say. Everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance.

Running and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip, knee and back injuries and surgeries. It’s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.

It’s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.

“We’ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,” said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. “I personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.”

Hydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.

Matt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke’s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient’s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who’s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they’d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.

“In water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn’t be able to do on land,” said Johnson.

A physical therapy patient at St. Luke’s in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, participates in water therapy in a Hydro Track system by Conray Incorporated. Physical Therapy at St. Luke's Hospital, Bethlehem, Pa.

He uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System – professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don’t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.

Johnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.

“At waist height, it’s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it’s about 30 percent of body weight,” Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.

“Taking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,” said Johnson.

A recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who’d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests – one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn’t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.

“The study proposes a different, very innovative approach” to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.

Wolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don’t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. “It’s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you’re trying to do – allowing a cardio-respiratory response,” Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.

She noted that medicine’s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.

Michael Phelps, Simone Manuel make history in Rio

Budd Coates, training director at Runner’s World magazine, said runners don’t just plunge into water​ therapy when they’re injured; it’s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.

An alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.

“It creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,” said Coates.

For those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.

Or, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.

If running’s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 31, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Weight-loss surgery helps people drop a significant amount of weight, and now a new study confirms that much of the weight appears to stay off for at least 10 years.

""This study suggests that patients interested in bariatric surgery, especially gastric bypass surgery, should be able to lose a significant amount of weight and keep that weight off for a very long time,"" said study researcher Matt Maciejewski. He's a professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine, in Durham, N.C.

While other research has found that weight-loss surgery is the most effective treatment for obese patients, there is less data on long-lasting effects. The new study is notable because of the decade-long follow-up, said Maciejewski, who is also a research career scientist at Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

In the two-part study, Maciejewski's team first looked at the results of about 1,800 men and women who had gastric bypass surgery. The investigators compared weight changes in gastric bypass surgery patients to weight changes in more than 5,300 obese veterans who had no weight-loss surgery or formal weight-loss treatment.

Gastric bypass surgery involves making the stomach smaller, and attaching the lower part of the small intestine directly to the stomach, so much of the small intestine is bypassed. After surgery, people feel much fuller, faster. The surgery also appears to alter gut hormones, gut bacteria and metabolism, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

At the study's one-year mark, those who had the bypass had lost 31 percent of their starting weight, but the non-surgical patients had lost just 1 percent.

At 10 years, the researchers had weight information on 564 of the nearly 1,800 patients who had the gastric bypass. Only 19 of them had regained so much weight that they were nearly back to their starting weight; the rest kept off the weight.

Compared to the non-surgical group, the bypass group weighed 21 percent less than at the start of the study.

Next, the researchers compared three types of weight-loss surgeries: gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; and adjustable gastric banding. In gastric banding, a band is placed at the top of the stomach to create a small pouch that reduces the size of the stomach. In sleeve gastrectomy, most of the stomach is removed, leaving a banana-shaped sleeve. As with gastric bypass surgery, both of these procedures leave people feeling full faster, according to NIDDK.

After four years, those who had gastric bypass lost nearly 28 percent of their starting weight. People who had sleeve gastrectomy lost about 18 percent and those with gastric banding lost about 11 percent, the researchers found.

The average age of the men and women studied was about 52, and three-quarters were men. Most were white.

The study was published online Aug. 31 in JAMA Surgery.

The study helps address a knowledge gap about long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Jon Gould, chief of general surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.

The study ""shows that the gastric bypass procedure compared to sleeve gastrectomy or adjustable gastric banding produces more weight loss and it was sustained over the long term,"" Gould said. He wrote a commentary to accompany the study in the same issue of the journal.

Based on the new study findings, Gould said, ""I think a patient who is young and who has a long way to go may want to think about these results, and all other things being equal, might pick a gastric bypass for the long-term weight loss.""

The new finding, he added, validates his belief that the gastric bypass could be a ""durable procedure.""

Maciejewski acknowledged that the study has limitations. For example, the study included mostly men, so the findings may not apply to women. In addition, women who undergo bariatric surgery are typically in their 30s through their 50s, he said. In this study, the average age of the men and women was 52.

""These results may not generalize to everyone,"" he said.

Another possible limitation was the loss of patients during the follow-up, which could have affected the results, the researchers noted.

An experimental drug dramatically reduced the toxic plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, a team reports in the journal Nature.

Results from a small number of patients who received a high dose of the drug, called aducanumab, hint that it may also be able to slow the loss of memory and thinking.

""If that hint of a clinical benefit is confirmed, it would be a game changer in the fight against Alzheimer's disease,"" says Dr. Eric Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix. Reiman wrote a commentary that accompanies the study in Nature.

But it will take much larger studies to show for sure whether aducanumab really does slow down Alzheimer's disease, Reiman says.

Officials of Biogen, which is developing the drug, were also cautious about interpreting the results of the study, which included 165 patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

""We think we have something important here,"" says Dr. Alfred Sandrock, chief medical officer for Biogen. ""We hope we're right because if it's true it would benefit millions of patients. But we don't know we're right yet.""



The results are encouraging for pharmaceutical companies that have spent billions of dollars on efforts to come up with the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's. Those efforts have failed to produce a single approved drug so far.

But last summer, Biogen began presenting its results with aducanumab at scientific meetings, including the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July. These early reports suggested the drug had a remarkable ability to remove plaques in the brain.

""It was surprising, encouraging and thought-provoking to see such a striking reduction of existing plaques,"" Reiman says.

The publication in Nature on Wednesday provides details about those early reports.

Biogen has already begun two much larger studies of aducanumab. They will include a total of 2,700 patients, and results are still several years off.

But there are reasons to think aducanumab may succeed where other drugs have failed.

One is that the drug appears to ignore benign forms of amyloid protein while attacking the toxic forms thought to damage brain cells. Another is that aducanumab seems to enhance the ability of existing immune cells in the brain to devour toxins, including amyloid.

But there's a downside. The process of removing plaque sometimes causes fluid to build up in the brain. In rare cases, it can also cause bleeding. These side effects are known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.

""We were actually anticipating that we would see it,"" Sandrock says. And the researchers did. Twenty patients dropped out of the trial because of adverse effects.

If aducanumab works in larger studies, it could help settle a long-running debate about whether amyloid is really the root cause of Alzheimer's. This idea is known as the amyloid hypothesis.

And large studies showing that removing amyloid can preserve memory and thinking ""would go a long way toward validating the amyloid hypothesis,"" Sandrock says.

Results like those could also lead to the first approved drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's rather than just the symptoms.",Test Of Experimental Alzheimer's Drug Finds Progress Against Brain Plaques,4,Alzheimer's

Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.

Ever since the large government study called the Women’s Health Initiative found a number of risks associated with menopause hormones, millions of women who are in or near menopause have been weathering hot flashes and other symptoms on their own. But now, new research suggests that the benefits of short-term hormone treatment to control life-disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks — as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause.

There are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement. And there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment.

For women without a history of cancer, blood clots or heart disease, most professional medical societies concerned with women’s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone.

Every day, about 6,000 women in the United States — more than two million women a year — enter menopause. At an average age of 51, they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle.

For months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins, many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity, sleep, moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse.

The most common symptom — hot flashes — can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night. Menopause-related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort, pain and bleeding with exercise, vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence.

Until the early 2000s, many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy — H.R.T. — to counter them. Even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used H.R.T. because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging.

Then in 2002, the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement, the Women’s Health Initiative (W.H.I.), created a kind of menopausal panic, prompting millions of middle-age women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them.

The study found that, among the women treated with the hormones, there was an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and, most frightening of all to many women, a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading H.R.T. regimen of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) and a synthetic progesterone (Provera) recommended for women who still had a uterus. (Those without a uterus, who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone, had no increase in breast cancer; in fact, they had a slight decrease over all.)

The hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women, the risks of H.R.T. seemed — on the surface — to outweigh the benefits.

However, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the W.H.I., “The W.H.I. findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted,” and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment. “The pendulum has swung too far,” she said.

The W.H.I. study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms. Most of the 27,347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s, already a decade or more past menopause. Rather, the study was designed to determine whether H.R.T. did, in fact, reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Among these older women, it found no such effect.

In the years after the W.H.I. findings, many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement, especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer.

Experts like Dr. Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women’s Hospital, maintain that the results of the W.H.I. study are not relevant to the more common use of H.R.T. for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments.

Dr. Howard N. Hodis, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Southern California, said the billion-dollar W.H.I. study made “a big mistake” by starting the hormones in older women, when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred. “The cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking H.R.T.,” he said.

In a Danish randomized controlled trial of 1,006 women entering menopause, among those given hormones for 10 years, “there was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer — a clear benefit with nominal risk,” Dr. Hodis said. These benefits persisted after 16 years of follow-up, according to the study, which was published in 2012.

Dr. Hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don’t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer.

In an analysis in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health, Dr. Philip M. Sarrel and his co-authors calculated that, based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the W.H.I. study, avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of 18,601 to 91,610 women in the decade after the study’s release.

Dr. Manson is distressed about the large number of women — about a third of those now on hormone replacement — who are relying on “custom-compounded” products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration. They come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages, she said.

“There’s little or no reason to go the custom-compound route,” she said. “Women today have so many options — a wide array of doses, from low to traditional, and ways to use them.” In addition to pills, there are patches, gels and sprays applied to the skin. Vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer.

To help women and their doctors assess H.R.T. options and select the best treatment for women 45 and older with menopausal symptoms, the North American Menopause Society has developed a mobile app, MenoPro, for iPhone/iPad and Android devices.

story_reviews_00370,"A brain tumor appears as a malformed blob on a brain scan, shining white among the surrounding gray tissue—a certain and devastating diagnosis. Doctors can begin treatment immediately, trying to save the most important organ in the body. The brain, however, is also vulnerable to many more, much less visible ailments.

Consider the case of Allie Orlando, a 23-year-old social service coordinator, who has received a plethora of diagnoses since she first saw a psychologist at 14. First, it was generalized anxiety disorder. Next, she was told she had depression. Then, when she was 17, it was settled: She suffered from borderline personality disorder. But when Orlando traveled out of state for college, she began seeing a new psychologist who strongly disagreed with her borderline diagnosis. Meanwhile, she continued to struggle and entered the hospital for suicidal ideation her sophomore year. The doctors there agreed: Borderline wasn’t the right diagnosis, and maybe she should stop taking the meds she had been prescribed.

“I was just frustrated because the stigma attached to borderline is very strong,” Orlando says. She had been open about her diagnosis in high school, but felt the “borderline” label may have scared some people off. She recalled her boyfriend at the time searching the web for her diagnosis and saying: “Oh God, no.” After that, she kept quiet about her diagnosis, worried it would drive friends away. “I’m sure it also affected what meds I was prescribed. It took a few years to find the right ‘formula’ of meds.” While the doctors recommended some medication that helped, it was a matter of trial and error, since Orlando still doesn’t have a concrete diagnosis today.

Research Into Biological Markers

The problem is that mental health diagnosis has essentially remained unchanged for 100 years, relying on symptoms and clinical interviews. Mental disorders lack what most other health diagnoses rely on: biological markers. A tumor seen on a scan, bacteria identified by a throat culture, a fracture captured on an X-ray: They’re all clear signs something is wrong. Mental health disorders are difficult to diagnose even by the most well-trained, well-meaning psychiatrists, because all they have to go on are questions and, sometimes, answers. “Diagnosis is really asking lots and lots of questions about their [patients’] experience, looking at patients’ answers both from what they say and how they say it,” says Dr. Michael Dulchin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University Medical Center. The uncertainty can lead to dangerous misdiagnoses.

Rachel Barrett/Gallery Stock

Without such signs to confirm their diagnosis, patients with mental illnesses are often burdened by the perception that they somehow have something less “real” than most other ailments. For years, researchers searched, in vain, for concrete signs in the brain that could tell them the difference between, for example, bipolar and depression. Now some believe the key may be realizing that mental illnesses are not necessarily contained in the brain: Biomarkers may be found throughout the entire body.

Dr. Sabine Bahn, a professor of neurotechnology at Cambridge University, leads a team researching this premise. As a Ph.D. student, she investigated the postmortem brains of psychiatric patients and was surprised to find differences in glucose regulation processes and certain parts of cell production in the brains of schizophrenia patients.

Bahn’s team then looked at the cerebrospinal fluid of early-stage schizophrenia patients who had not yet taken any medication and again saw abnormalities in glucose handling. Bahn says it was a revelation that such changes could be spotted in the blood of patients in such early stages of the disease. What if, her team began to think, it could come up with a blood test for schizophrenia? Having this kind of tool would be invaluable—with the current interview-based methods of diagnosis, subtle symptoms of schizophrenia are missed until too late, delaying treatment by months, or even years.

Armed with her previous research, Bahn and her team detailed a panel of blood biomarkers in individuals who have an increased risk of schizophrenia but have no visible symptoms yet. The test, says Bahn, can accurately predict whether someone will “develop schizophrenia over the next two years.”

Bahn’s finding is one of several recent advancements toward a comprehensive system of biological mental health diagnostic tools. One group of researchers, for example, recently worked backward to take on the problematic overlap between depression and bipolar disorder—many bipolar patients are initially and incorrectly diagnosed with depression. The team took urine samples from patients who had been diagnosed with one of the two disorders and looked for differences between the two groups. The results, published in the Journal of Proteome Research, showed that 20 different metabolites differentiated the two groups. Another team of scientists identified differences in the throat bacteria of schizophrenic and healthy people. Previous research had suggested tentative links between immune disorders, which are influenced in part by microbes in the body, and schizophrenia; the new study, published in PeerJ, furthered the possibility that differences in oral bacteria could be associated with the disorder.

Challenging to Bring to Market

Despite these exciting preliminary findings, there aren’t yet any biological tests for mental illness widely used in medical practice. In some cases, the reason is primarily financial. “The problem with schizophrenia is that although about 1 percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia, the number of new patients per year is quite low, at 0.02 percent,” says Bahn. “As the development costs of a test are very high, there is a risk that the test will not be commercially viable.” For severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, it’s also the case that even if a test made it through development and hit the market, it may not be successfully integrated into psychiatric practice. That’s because, Dulchin says, if a patient comes in with schizophrenia symptoms that a doctor knows can be alleviated with drugs, the doctor is not likely to deny that patient treatment—no matter what a biological test says.

Those working on these sorts of tests see them being implemented in a different setting entirely: when a patient comes into their internist seeking treatment for other conditions. “Psychiatric disorders often present with other diseases such as diabetes and some immune disorders,” says Bahn. If there was a blood test for depression, it could just become part of a standard panel—and thus help achieve earlier diagnoses, and in turn earlier treatment, across the board.

But, if biological tests for mental illness do come to fruition, even those already living with a condition could benefit. “I think if this biological aspect was attached to it, then people would see that stigmatizing someone for their depression is as ridiculous as stigmatizing someone for their diabetes,” Orlando says. “People often need concrete, tangible facts, and that’s what scares them about mental illness and what causes the stigmatization—they just don’t understand it.”",Can Blood Tests Detect Schizophrenia and Other Mental Illnesses?,3,Newsweek

story_reviews_00372,"Sharon Samuels was a teenager when she was first diagnosed with essential tremor. Over the years her condition worsened, until a new therapy came along to help improve her brain's motor circuit.

For decades, Sharon Samuels struggled with simple everyday tasks like brushing her teeth, buttoning her shirt, putting on makeup, and eating food.

“I did not want to go out socially with other people, especially people who I did not know, because I could see them looking at me. And the feeling was horrible,” she recalled. “It would take my heart away when I was trying to eat and I’d look up and they were looking at me.”

Samuels, 72, has essential tremor, a movement disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking mostly in the hands or legs. An estimated 10 million people in the United States suffer from the condition, according to the International Essential Tremor Foundation. The disorder isn’t fatal, but it tends to get worse with age and to affect patients’ quality of life.

Doctors usually treat essential tremor with medication, but the drugs don’t work well for all patients. Now a new trial finds that a treatment to kill off neurons in a certain region of the brain can do away with tremors in some patients who don’t respond to drugs. But the procedure brings lasting side effects in some patients, and its long-term usefulness is still being studied.

In an ongoing clinical trial at 11 medical centers globally, researchers are using ultrasound waves to treat the source of essential tremor in the brain. The therapy, called focused ultrasound thalamotomy, uses the energy generated by sound waves to burn off certain cells in the thalamus, a region of the brain where the essential tremor is thought to originate.

Patients are placed in an MRI machine with their head secured in place in a special helmet. They are awake as doctors aim over 1,000 low-energy ultrasound waves to create a lesion — an injury to the tissue — inside the thalamus.

“As we make the test lesion, we see a subtle improvement in their tremor and the patients notice it,” said Dr. Rees Cosgrove who is leading the trial at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Brigham is one of the six centers running the trial in the US.

“As we enlarge the lesion, the tremor just stops and they’ll just look at their hand. It has been shaking for years and they look at it as though, ‘Hmm, is this really my hand?’ It’s really a remarkable moment.”

For Samuels, who underwent the procedure on June 29, the recovery has been surprising. She had been taking tremor medication for almost a decade with little improvement. After the procedure, which only focused on her left hand, her tremor there has almost disappeared.

“This has changed the quality of my life,” she said. “Now, it’s a pleasure, I can sign my name, I can write. I can eat like a normal person, doing things that I couldn’t do before.”

In July, the Food and Drug Administration approved the device being used in the trial. It has been developed by InSightec, which is funding the trial along with the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.

A pilot study on MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment was published in 2013.

The randomized trial provides further data on the treatment. In the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, 76 patients were treated with focused ultrasound, and their tremor was evaluated after the first, third, sixth, and 12th month. Researchers found that the severity of essential tremor reduced significantly over that time in the patients who underwent the treatment versus those who had a sham procedure. The treated group also evaluated their quality of life as much better than before the procedure, despite a few persistent side effects like gait disturbance and paresthesia — the sensation of prickling pins and needles.

Neurologist Dr. Bryan Ho, who is not involved in the trial, noted that tremor suppression remained sustained throughout the 12 months. But he expressed concern about the side effects of the treatment.

“Over a third of patients actually experienced either gait disturbance or paresthesia. It’s a pretty high incidence of side effects,” said Dr. Ho, who is the director of the Movement Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center.

He added that since these patients were only followed for a year, there isn’t enough data available yet to determine the long-term efficacy of the treatment.

“It’s one and done,” he said. “Patients may have some benefit for a period of time, but how do they do five years from now or 10 years from now after the treatment? That needs to be shown.”

The researchers are in the process of collecting this data; the clinical trial will run until December. The doctors at Brigham will follow up with Samuels — and others who undergo the treatment — for up to five years and run more MRI scans and neurological exams to find out for how long the lesion lasts and keeps the tremor suppressed.

For now, the treatment has had an immense impact on patients’ lives. “These people are able to go back and now use that hand like you and I use our hands, without thinking about it,” said Dr. Cosgrove.

“They can write their names again, they can feed themselves, they are not embarrassed about being in public. So it really is extraordinarily helpful for people.”",Focused brain ultrasound offers some hope for essential tremor,4,STAT
story_reviews_00373,"For women older than 50 who have been confused by conflicting advice on how frequently to get a mammogram, some new science is here to guide their decisions.

An ambitious research effort published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine set out to tailor women’s breast cancer screening practices to match their actual risk of breast cancer. It concludes that a woman’s breast density should influence the frequency with which she is screened for breast cancer, in addition to such long-recognized breast cancer risk factors as age, ethnicity, personal history of abnormal breast findings and a family history of breast cancer.

For a small slice of those women, that makes a once-a-year mammogram — twice as often as the current standard — the best bet.

Underwritten by the National Cancer Institute, the new study combined the data-collection efforts of breast-cancer epidemiologists with three separate teams of cancer modelers. In the study, women were separated into subcategories based on four levels each of individual risk and breast density.

The research recommends that women older than 50 with dense breast tissue who have higher-than-normal risk of developing breast cancer should get annual mammograms. These women, however, represent a small minority of women in that age group — less than 1% of all women between 50 and 74.

Many women, however, could go as long as three years between mammograms without increasing their risk of death from breast cancer, the study found. For women with average risk and low breast density, the models showed that there was no difference in deaths averted from breast cancer whether they were screened every two years or every three years. Women who had a mammogram every three years, however, had fewer unnecessary follow-up procedures, including biopsies.

Accepted clinical guidelines recommend that women 50 to 74 get a mammogram every two years. These recommendations, first proposed in 2009 by a federal task force, urged women to discuss with their physicians whether more frequent screening might be in order. But they have continued to be controversial with some activist and medical groups that believe additional lives could be saved if more women got an annual mammogram.

The latest study largely validates the controversial recommendations made by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009. But it also clarifies which women should or could depart safely from its recommendations.

Only in the last decade or so have radiologists, oncologists and women’s health specialists begun to appreciate the role of breast density in a woman’s breast cancer risk. While radiologists have long warned that dense breast tissue made cancerous masses harder to spot, mounting evidence has found that cancer is also more likely to gain a foothold in dense breast tissue.

The latest effort is the first to produce a risk calculator that takes that into account, and asks for a radiologist’s standardized assessment of breast density in its six-point questionnaire. Many states now require radiologists reading mammograms to assign and communicate to a woman and her physician this density measure, called a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, or BI-RADS, score.

Overall, the risk measure calculates a woman’s likelihood of developing breast cancer over five and 10 years, and compares it to normal risk.

In devising their models, the researchers updated assumptions that have cast doubt on the relevance of existing breast-cancer risk calculators, which relied on the experiences of women who got an earlier generation of screening mammograms and were more likely to die of breast cancer than is currently the case. Here, teams of modelers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare assumed that women were getting digital mammograms, which offer improved cancer detection rates at lower radiation dosages than earlier mammographic methods. They took into account improved rates of breast cancer treatment effectiveness, and changing causes of mortality for women older than 50. They also took account of the fact that breast density decreases in older women.

“These models are very applicable to the populations we screen,” said UC San Francisco breast-cancer specialist Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, one of the lead authors of the new study.

The practice of tailoring screening intervals to a woman’s breast cancer risk is already widespread in some European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain. A Spanish study, similar to the latest modeling effort, found that implementing a general three-year screening interval, with yearly screening for high-risk women, reduced overdiagnosis and caught more missed cancers.

“Some lesions detected in screening will never grow to become clinically significant and will not impact a woman’s life,” Kerlikowske said.

story_reviews_00374,"A perfect sleeping pill — one that gets people to fall asleep faster, and for a longer period of time, with no side effects — is still a dream.

Such a magic pill could potentially solve many problems. Millions of Americans don't get enough sleep. In a recent survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 35 percent of Americans are sleeping fewer than seven hours per night, the recommended healthy amount.

Good sleep doesn't just boost our feelings of well-being. There's a growing scientific consensus that it protects us against heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. In sleep labs, participants who have their sleep cycles severely thrown off for just three weeks can start to appear pre-diabetic on blood tests. (If you doubt the importance of sleep consider this: Scientists now believe that cycles of restfulness and alertness are core organizing principles of all life on Earth. Even the tiniest single-cell organisms contain the genetic coding for a circadian rhythm.)

Ever wonder how your mind works? Watch The Mind, Explained, our 5-part miniseries on the workings of the brain. Available to stream now on Netflix.

Of course, there are many prescription sleep aids on the market; unfortunately, they aren't very effective and can be addictive and dangerous.

So many prefer to walk into a corner drug store and buy an alternative for just $6 that's marketed as safe and all natural. It's melatonin, and unlike other chemicals sold as nutrition supplements in America, there's some scientific evidence to back up its claims.

But like all sleep drugs, melatonin's story is complicated. Despite the fact it's a chemical that our bodies naturally produce during sleep, how melatonin actually works, and what it's best for, is worth a good, hard look.

What is melatonin?

Melatonin was originally discovered in the 1950s, when a dermatology lab thought it played a role in skin pigmentation. The researchers all took a massive dose of their newfound chemical, expecting their skin to lighten. But they just got sleepy.

What scientists eventually realized about melatonin is this: It's the hormone that tells the body when it is nighttime. It's made in the pineal gland, a pinecone-shaped structure located deep in the brain.

""In lower vertebrates like the frog, the pineal is in fact a third eye — it’s a light-dark receptor,"" Dick Wurtman, a MIT cognitive scientist who help discover melatonin's function in humans, says. Scientists once assumed that it had served a function in mammals but had become a vestigial organ, bound to ""disappear in a few million years,"" Wurtman says.

In the 1960s, Wurtman and his team at MIT found that light does still reach the pineal in mammals — through the eyes — and controls the release of melatonin. During the day, melatonin is inhibited by light. At night, it flows into the bloodstream — unless we're around bright light or blue light, which suppress the release of melatonin, and keep us up.

When it does reach the bloodstream, melatonin acts as a messenger. How the body responds to the message depends on the animal. Rats, for instance, are nocturnal, so melatonin may play a role in keeping them awake. In humans and other day-dwelling creatures, it prepares the body for rest and helps maintain that rest throughout the night.

In humans, melatonin is thought to promote sleep in two ways.

1. The exact pathway isn't well understood, but it's believed melatonin broadly suppresses the areas of the brain involved in wakefulness. Melatonin may also play a role in lowering body temperature, which is needed for sleep.

2. Melatonin helps set the overall pace of the master circadian clock in the body. Scientists have shown that when people are given melatonin in the afternoon, their body clocks can be tricked into thinking it's later, and they get sleepier sooner. This can be handy if you're suffering from jet lag, and your body thinks it's still in an earlier time zone. (More on this later.)

So how well does melatonin work?

When assessing melatonin, there are a couple of big questions researchers are asking:

Does it help people with insomnia fall asleep faster?

Does it help people stay asleep?

Does it help people sleep in new time zones?

Is it helpful for people adjusting to new shifts at work?

And does it reliably shift a person's body clock to a new phase?

The studies that have been done on these questions have tested a wide range of doses on many different populations, which makes direct comparisons among studies very difficult, and limits what we can really learn from them. But the meta analyses of melatonin that do exist does find some evidence that it can be helpful in regard to most of the above questions.

Patty Deuster, a research scientist at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, was the senior author on a 2014 systematic review on melatonin. She and her team amassed a total of 35 randomized, placebo-controlled studies on healthy people with or without a diagnosis of insomnia. The effect of melatonin for insomnia was positive, but ""weak,"" says Deutster. More studies with greater number of participants are needed.

Her review found weak positive findings for sleep onset, staying asleep, and jet lag. The evidence for shift workers and shifting the body clock were inconclusive. (However, the experts with whom I spoke said melatonin should be taken in the late afternoon to have the best chance at shifting the biological clock. Deuster's report only looked at phase-shifting studies when melatonin is given at night.)

International health organizations have analyzed melatonin research as well.

In Europe, melatonin is only available by prescription in some countries. In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority, which regulates melatonin, conducted an overview of the evidence on melatonin and concluded this: ""Melatonin helps reduce the time to fall asleep.'""

That might be true, but not all researchers agree that melatonin can make a meaningful difference. Philip Gehrman, a sleep researcher and clinician at the University of Pennsylvania, says, ""The research is pretty clear that melatonin is a lousy sleeping pill.""

A 2005 meta review looked at this question more closely, analyzing 15 placebo-controlled studies of otherwise healthy people with insomnia. It found, on average, melatonin decreased the time it took to fall asleep compared to placebo by 3.9 minutes, it increased the time spent asleep by 13.7 minutes, and increased sleep efficiency (a ratio of time spent lying bed versus time sleeping) by 3.1 percent.

Meanwhile, a 2007 meta-analysis found that a type of prescription sleeping pill called benzodiazepines got people to sleep 10 minutes faster on average. Non-benzodiazepines (like Ambien) get people to sleep about 12.8 minutes faster. And once you're asleep, these drugs only increase the time spent asleep by 30 or so minutes. (Don't forget that these drugs can be addicting, and can kill a person in high enough doses.)

Melatonin may work best for jet lag and in people who have low melatonin

When a person is jet lagged, their body's clock is off from the clock of their destination. This can make it hard to sleep.

Melatonin may be particularly helpful for jet laggers because it can both help change a person's internal clock to match local time, and it can help them sleep after a long, restless flight.

In 2002, the Cochrane Library conducted a systematic review of melatonin's ability to help a person readjust to a new sleep schedule after jet lag at doses as small as .5 milligrams. ""Melatonin is remarkably effective in preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short-term use appears to be safe,"" the review concluded, especially when used after eastward flights. ""Eight of the ten trials found that melatonin, taken close to the target bedtime at the destination (10pm to midnight), decreased jet-lag from flights crossing five or more time zones.""

Melatonin also seems to work much better for certain individuals.

""If your sleep problem results from a deficiency of the hormone melatonin, then melatonin will be very effective for your sleep problem,"" Wurtman says. If sleep problems stem from anxiety, for instance, it will be less effective.

Frank Scheer, who studies chronobiology at Harvard, agrees: An oral dose of melatonin has the best chance to make someone sleepy when internal melatonin levels are low. ""In healthy subjects, if you give subjects melatonin in the middle of the day, it will help them sleep [during the middle of the day],"" he says. ""If I give melatonin to you during the night [when melatonin levels are higher], and you're healthy, melatonin won't have any effect on sleep.""

Scheer also notes that melatonin doesn't follow a typical dose-response curve. That means taking a higher dose of melatonin doesn't necessarily result in more sleepiness.

People tend to produce less melatonin as they age, so the hormone may be more suited to treating the insomnia that's the result of aging. Melatonin also been shown to be much more effective for people with delayed sleep phase, a condition where a person's biological clock is permanently out of sync with the rest of the world.

Are there side effects?

Deuster's review looked at the reporting of adverse effects across all 35 studies, and found nothing serious. The most commonly reported side effect was drowsiness (which is kind of the point of taking melatonin) and headache.

But Scheer says there are some cases where melatonin can have adverse effects. For some people with a particular genetic variant, melatonin impairs the body's ability to process blood glucose. ""It's not harmless,"" he says.

The risks of long-term use have also not been assessed. ""There are no clear studies beyond six months of duration on melatonin's use,"" Scheer says.

When to take melatonin

Researchers have never done a systematic review of whether the timing of melatonin matters for people who want to get to sleep faster.

The ones I talked to also disagreed on when to take it — depending on whether they thought melatonin was better for sleep promotion or circadian clock resetting.

According to Gehrman, melatonin's ability to shift the circadian clock is stronger than its ability to promote immediate sleep. Therefore, ""instead of taking it at bed time, you take it several hours before bedtime,"" he says. This can ""advance"" the biological clock around a half hour, every day.

Scheer agrees that taking melatonin in the late afternoon or early evening ""will result in the largest phase advance, meaning the next day your body clock will be slightly earlier."" Exposure to sunlight in the morning helps, too, he says, and may be even more effective than melatonin, or should be used in addition to melatonin, when pushing the clock forward.

Wurtman, however, doesn't recommend taking melatonin several hours before bed. He says melatonin's (albeit weak) ability to promote sleep on the spot means that people should take it shortly before bed.

Overall, Scheer says, the ideal time for any individual to take it is hard to predict. Melatonin is ""not simple to use as a consumer,"" he says, adding that many primary care physicians may not know about its subtleties.

Another reason for caution: Melatonin isn't well regulated

Vox's Julia Belluz has done extensive reporting on the murky regulations of dietary supplements in America. Basically, she finds, the dietary supplement aisle is a minefield. Supplements don't always contain what they say they do, and they can have harmful additives. That's why it's important make sure the brand of melatonin you buy has its contents verified by a third party, like USP. (According to Wurtman, the fact that we treat melatonin as a dietary supplement is ""unmitigated bullshit."" None of our bodies' natural melatonin comes from diet.)

In the case of melatonin, the lax regulations means it can be sold in massive, completely, unnecessary doses. At the drug store, it's easy to pick up a 10 milligram per pill bottle of melatonin. But this is likely overkill. Many of the studies on melatonin find that it works just as well at small doses — around one milligram or less — as it does in high doses. Plus, there's a chance a huge dose will desensitize your brain to the hormone.

""If you present to your brain blood levels of melatonin that are way, way higher than any that occur normally, you desensitize the brain’s receptors to melatonin,"" Wurtman says. ""You become less and less and less responsive.""

The bottom line, according to the experts? Start with a small dose and see if it works for you.

And finally: Know that a pill may never fully combat the reasons why Americans are sleeping poorly. There are myriad ways the modern world conspires against good sleep: Stress at home and work, noisy neighborhoods, spending too little time in bright daylight, drinking too much caffeine, working odd shifts, not getting enough exercise, spending too much time with smartphones late at night, and the list goes on.",What is melatonin and can it help me sleep?,5,Vox
story_reviews_00375,"If a pill could prevent teenagers from taking dangerous risks, would you consider it for your children?

I’d be tempted. My skateboard- and bicycle-riding son was hit by a car—twice—when he was a teenager. I would have welcomed anything that could have averted those dreadful phone calls from the emergency room.

While some bumps and scares are inevitable for active guys like him, serious misadventures with long-lasting repercussions are often par for the course for a subset of them—those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. But a new article suggests that early medication can significantly cut the odds of bad things happening later.

Affecting nearly 9% of all Americans between 4 and 18 years of age, ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders and also one of the most misunderstood. Its symptoms color almost every aspect of a child’s life—from being able to focus in school to making and keeping friends, reining in fleeting impulses and assessing risk and danger.

Indeed, accidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with ADHD, with one 2015 study of over 710,000 Danish children finding that 10- to 12-year-olds with ADHD were far more likely to be injured than other children their age. Drug treatment made a big difference, however, nearly halving the number of emergency room visits by children with ADHD.

Medicating children to address problems with attention and self-control remains controversial. ADHD isn’t visible, like chickenpox, nor immediately life-threatening, like asthma. Its distortion of a child’s ability to meet adults’ expectations creates an atmosphere of frustration and blame. So it’s not often taken for what it really is: a neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic roots.

An enduring myth about ADHD is that children grow out of it in adolescence. We now know that a 5-year-old with a bona fide attentional disorder may well become a dreamy, restless and impulsive teenager and adult. Adolescents with ADHD think even less about consequences than the average teenager and are especially thrilled by novelty. They’re more likely than their friends to drink too much, drive like maniacs, abuse drugs and have unprotected sex.

It’s a sobering list. But an article published last month by Princeton researchers Anna Chorniy and Leah Kitashima in the journal Labour Economics shows that treating ADHD with medication during childhood can head off later problems. “We have 11 years of data for every child enrolled in South Carolina Medicaid who was diagnosed with ADHD,” Dr. Chorniy told me. The researchers tracked each doctor visit and every prescription, with a sample of over 58,000 children whose health progress they tracked into adulthood.

This long view let the economists compare the behaviors of teens treated with the most common ADHD medications, such as Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall, to the types of risks taken by other children with ADHD who were not treated. The researchers found fewer and less severe injuries and health problems among the treated children: a 3.6% reduction in sexually transmitted infections; 5.8% fewer children who sought screening for sexually transmitted infections (suggesting they had had an unprotected sexual tryst); and 2% fewer teen pregnancies.

That adds up to a lot fewer teenagers in trouble.

The economists did their study based on existing data, but randomized, controlled studies—experiments carefully designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships—have reached the same conclusion: that medication to control ADHD can reduce the high price in psychic pain, loss of educational opportunity and riven relationships. A child whose disorder is diagnosed and treated early by a trained clinician stands a better chance of growing into a healthy and thoughtful adult.",Medicating Children With ADHD Keeps Them Safer,3,Wall Street Journal

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Aug. 16, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of bone fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis better than a placebo and the currently available drug, a new study finds.

In this phase 3 trial funded by the drug's maker, Radius Health, fewer women on the injectable drug abaloparatide had spine fractures (0.58 percent) than women receiving a placebo (4.22 percent) and slightly fewer than those taking a similar injectable drug, teriparatide (Forteo) (0.84 percent).

""If this gets approved, and there is no reason to think it won't, this will be the second drug available for the treatment of high-risk osteoporosis,"" said lead researcher Dr. Paul Miller of the Colorado Center for Bone Research.

Forteo has been in use for the past 16 years, he said. Abaloparatide works differently from Forteo and improves bone density more than Forteo, Miller said.

Women taking abaloparatide also had fewer other types of fractures (2.7 percent) than those who got a placebo (4.7 percent) and slightly fewer than those on Forteo (3.3 percent), the researchers found.

Miller said many spine fractures are painless. Patients are often unaware they have happened until a doctor measures their height and finds they are up to an inch shorter than before, he said.

Abaloparatide and Forteo are synthetic peptides that help grow and strengthen bone, Miller said.

Along with building bone density, they are the only ones that increase bone quality, he said. ""Bone quality is an important aspect of bone strength -- the ability to withstand a break,"" Miller said.

He predicts that when abaloparatide is on the market, it will compete with Forteo, driving down the price of both drugs.

""I am hoping that having a second drug available, that it will help reduce the cost,"" he said. ""Forteo costs about $2,500 a month if you don't have insurance."" Even if a patient is insured, monthly copays can range from $30 to $400. Forteo is covered by Medicare, Miller said.

The report was published Aug. 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

A study based on 2010 U.S. Census data estimated that more than 3 million women between the ages of 50 and 69 have osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman has a 44 percent lifetime risk of fracture due to low bone density.

For the study, Miller and colleagues randomly assigned nearly 2,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections of abaloparatide, Forteo or a placebo for 18 months. Their average age was 69.

Among the nearly 2,000 women who completed the trial, increases in bone mineral density were greater with abaloparatide than placebo, the researchers found.

In addition, fewer cases of hypercalcemia (abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) occurred among women taking abaloparatide (3 percent) than Forteo (6 percent). Hypercalcemia can weaken bones, cause kidney stones and interfere with heart and brain function.

There were no differences among the groups in other serious side effects, such as nausea and heart palpations, Miller said.

Dr. Caroline Messer, director of the Center for Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Disorders at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, is eager for further research. There needs to be a large head-to-head trial between Forteo and abaloparatide, she said, to really see which drug is better.

""Everybody is going to want to know if this is inferior or superior to Forteo,"" she said, adding that this is an early study. ""It shows more bone building and fewer fractures than Forteo, but whether it will replace that drug is still up in the air.""

An editorial accompanying the study said which drug is selected may be less important than identifying and starting an approved treatment.

""The bar is high for any preventive treatment -- in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies . . . and easier delivery systems, but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use,"" the editorial said.

The editorial was co-written by Dr. Anne Cappola of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, associate editor of JAMA, and Dr. Dolores Shoback of the University of California, San Francisco.

When you first meet Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the first thing you notice is his hair — or the lack of it.

toggle caption NPR

He's completely bald.

""At age 11, I developed this condition, called alopecia areata, where I lost my hair,"" says Velasquez-Manoff, a science writer in Berkeley, Calif. ""It started in patches, but eventually I lost it all.""

A few years ago Velasquez-Manoff was working on a book about autoimmune diseases, like allergies, asthma, Crohn's disease and alopecia. He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut — permanently.

The worms were getting rave reviews. ""People were saying, 'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!'"" Velasquez-Manoff says.

So he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?

He went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.

Hookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.

""They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,"" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.

Then the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine — where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood — a few drops a day.

At that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.

""That's the really fascinating thing,"" he says. You see, the worms don't shut down the immune system completely — just enough so that the immune cells won't attack the worm.

But this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.

""If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that's out of control,"" Loke says.

Why? Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.

The idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.

The first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease.

The bottom line: ""The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,"" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.

The whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn's disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company's stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.

Other trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. ""The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.""

It's unclear why the worms haven't worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person's genes.

Back in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.

A little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.

""Like just gone, gone, gone,"" he says.

And his hair?

""Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,"" Velasquez-Manoff says.

But then the tide turned. ""Suddenly it's like one day, the whole thing reversed.""

His hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore.

And having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.

""I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],"" Velasquez-Manoff says.

He says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.

""The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,"" Velasquez-Manoff says. ""I wouldn't want them to feel this way.""",Could Worms In Your Gut Cure Your Allergies?,3,NPR
story_reviews_00378,"Britain’s 650,000 people with bipolar disorder should take lithium to help control their condition, despite its reputation for dulling the senses, a significant new study has found.

Researchers claim that although the drug does carry some health risks, its overall effectiveness, especially its ability to reduce self-harm and suicide, mean it should be much more widely used.

The findings are contained in the first study comparing the side-effects of the four main mood-stabilising drugs the NHS prescribes. They have prompted calls for a rethink about attitudes towards lithium, given that only an estimated 10% of those with bipolar disorder use it, mainly because patients fear it will cause loss of personality, weight gain and other problems.

The lead author behind the research told the Guardian that widespread “lithium stigma” among patients is leading to them receiving the wrong treatment and ending up admitted to hospital unnecessarily because their condition is not as well controlled as it could be.

“Lithium is a drug with a bad reputation. It is seen by patients, and some psychiatrists, as a dangerous drug. People rightly have suspicions about it. Patients say that the downsides include emotional numbing – feeling that you aren’t connected with your feelings – as well as tremors,” said Dr Joseph Hayes, a psychiatrist at University College London.

But lithium’s reputation is largely misplaced and based on the experiences of patients from the 1960s to the 1980s who were given too large a dose of the drug, he added. The new research, published in the medical journal PLOS Medicine, found that the side-effects of the mood-stabilising alternatives used by most patients are either the same as or worse than lithium, Hayes said.

The paper, co-written by Hayes and four colleagues from UCL and Oxford University, concluded that: “Lithium remains an important treatment for individuals with bipolar disorder.” It accepts that “there is clear evidence that its use is associated with a number of adverse events.”

However, it adds: “These risks need to be offset with the potentially superior effectiveness and anti-suicidal benefits of the drug compared to other treatment options.”

The researchers studied a nationally representative sample of 6,671 patients across the UK who were treated for bipolar disorder between 1995 and 2013. Of those, 2,148 had taken lithium, 1,670 had used valproate, 1,477 had been on olanzapine and 1,376 had taken quetiapine. They experienced side-effects including chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, weight gain and high blood pressure.

The researchers’ analysis bore out one of the two main criticisms of lithium, but found the other to be baseless. They found that patients on lithium had a higher risk of suffering kidney function problems and developing hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and also hypercalcemia. However, none of the drugs caused more severe kidney problems.

Meanwhile, lithium patients were less likely to put on weight than patients on the other drugs. While 15%-20% of those on the three other drugs were more likely to gain more than 15% of their body weight, just 10% of those on lithium put on the same amount of extra pounds. Those on olanzapine added the most weight and experienced high blood pressure as a result.

I think many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment Dr Joseph Hayes

Separate research has shown that patients on the other three medications are 40% more likely to harm themselves than those on lithium. Bipolar disorder carries one of the highest rates of suicide of any mental illness, alongside schizophrenia and alcohol and drug addiction.

The very limited use of lithium is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) advising in 2014 that it should be the standard treatment for bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic depression and is characterised by manic highs and bouts of depression. That superseded its previous view, outlined in 2006, that any of the four drugs were useful first lines of treatment for the condition, which affects about one in 100 people.

“Lithium stigma, which includes some people in the psychiatric community, leads to people using drugs that are less effective [than lithium]. To me as a doctor that’s a big worry because my main aim is to help people to be well and if you aren’t doing that with the best available evidence then you are failing patients,” said Hayes.

“I think that many patients are missing out quite commonly on the best available treatment. That means that people end up in hospital more often than they need to and end up achieving less in their lives than they could do if they were on lithium. The high suicide rate with bipolar disorder should encourage greater use of lithium. There should be more sensible use of it.”

Stephen Buckley, head of information at the charity Mind, said: “We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications for people experiencing mental health problems, including bipolar disorder. But as with all areas of mental health there is still more research to be done.

“Different people will find that different treatments help with managing their mental health problems. This may be medication, talking therapies, or a mixture of both.”","Lithium should be more widely used for bipolar disorder, researchers say",4,The Guardian
story_reviews_00379,"Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, can be fully cured with an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for period pain, a new research by the University of Manchester shows. Currently, no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease, but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression.

Researchers, who conducted the study on mice, found that mefenamic acid — a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) used to relieve menstrual pain — can completely reverse memory loss and brain inflammation that are hallmark changes of Alzheimer’s, which currently affects over five million Americans.

For the study, researchers used 20 transgenic mice that develop symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems. They were divided in groups of 10. First group was given mefenamic acid dose and the other group was given placebo for one month through a mini-pump implanted under the skin.

Researchers observed that memory loss was fully reversed to the levels seen in mice without Alzheimer’s.

“There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple [NSAID] can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome, which damages brain cells,” David Brough, lead author of the study said, in a statement.

Brough, however, cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long-term implications.

“However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. Because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known, the time for it to reach patients should, in theory, be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs,” Brough said.

Researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat Alzheimer’s by blocking a particular part of the immune response. But, they also warned that these “drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for Alzheimer’s disease at this stage - studies in people are needed first.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The first new asthma pill in decades has produced promising results in a small clinical trial, potentially paving the way for another treatment option for patients by the end of the decade.

Fevipiprant, which is being developed by Novartis, reduced a biological marker of asthma nearly five-fold in the 12-week trial involving 61 patients, researchers said on Saturday. No serious adverse events were reported.

Larger and longer studies are now needed to prove that the twice-daily pill can also reduce severe asthma attacks, known as exacerbations. Novartis believes the medicine could be filed for regulatory approval in around 2019.

Pills for asthma used to be standard treatment 40 or 50 years ago, but those older products were often associated with worrying side effects. They have since been replaced by inhalers that deliver small amounts of drugs directly into the lungs.

The Novartis pill works in a very precise way to block the action of inflammatory cells called eosinophils.

The latest research, published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, comes at a time of considerable innovation in asthma care, with the recent launch of new injectable drugs for severe asthma that also target eosinophils.

At the same time, many drugmakers are developing improved asthma inhalers, including “smart” devices with sensors that monitor use.",Novartis asthma pill shows promise in small trial,4,Reuters
story_reviews_00382,"Researchers out of the University of Leicester have developed a new asthma pill for the first time in 20 years, which they believe will significantly improve symptoms for those with severe asthma. The drug, known as Fevipiprant (QAW039), was shown to reduce asthma symptoms as well as inflammation, and it improved lung function and repaired airway linings.

The pill may be a “game changer for future treatment of asthma,” said Professor Chris Brightling, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Research Fellow at the University of Leicester, in a press release.

In the study, the researchers examined 61 participants who were divided into two groups: The first was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks, and the second group was given a placebo. By measuring the sputum eosinophil — the inflammation marker that shows how white blood cells increase during asthma attacks — the researchers were able to track the effects of the drug. When asthma symptoms occur, the number of white blood cells rises, and this measurement is used to define how severe the condition is. For people with asthma, a sputum eosinophil reading will typically be around five percent, compared to people without asthma, who have readings that are lower than one percent.

Pixabay, public domain

As the researchers tracked the participants over the course of 12 weeks, they found that those taking the drug saw a decrease in their sputum eosinophil reading from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent.

“A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works,” said Brightling in the press release. “Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all the types of tests. We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.”

Ultimately, the researchers hope that the drug “could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms – making it a ‘game changer’ for future treatment,” said Brightling.

That’s a shame. Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it’s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. And the drawbacks of colonoscopy — including the time commitment, not-so-fun preparation, expense and small chance of harm — are probably keeping some people from participating in colorectal cancer screening.

According to public health experts, that’s a bad thing. The United States Preventive Services Task Force says the net benefit for screening adults age 50-75 is “substantial,” adding that colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the country. But as of 2012, just 65 percent of eligible adults were being screened as recommended, and almost 28 percent had never been screened.

Among those who are screened, colonoscopy is by far the most popular method in the U.S. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies — and they’re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF’s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. The group said that while some tests are backed by more evidence than others, it found no head-to-head studies suggesting any strategy — including colonoscopy — is better than another. “Choose the one that fits your preferences and lifestyle,” said Douglas Owens, a physician and member of the task force.

Included on the list are two cheap, at-home poop tests intended to be done annually: the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and a more sensitive test called the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. Both look for tiny amounts of blood in the stool that might be shed by cancer or polyps. You get one from your doctor, take a poop sample at home, and then return the sample to the doctor. Only if you get a positive result do you need to have a colonoscopy. (These are different from a new stool-based DNA test, which while on the USPSTF’s list is much more expensive and has been studied less.)

Of the two, Richard Wender, a physician and chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said the FIT is preferable, both because it’s more accurate and because it requires only one poop sample and no changes in diet. It costs about $25 or less and when done every year, the USPSTF’s models estimate, it will avert 20-23 deaths from colorectal cancer per 1,000 people screened. (Wender doesn’t recommend the OTC tests that are available.)

That’s comparable to the two “scope” tests on the USPSTF’s list, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which have the advantage of both detecting and removing precancerous polyps in one procedure. (Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the large intestine, has been shown by randomized trials to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer but isn’t reimbursed as well as colonoscopy and is on the decline in the U.S.)

Colonoscopy is the most popular test in the U.S. In addition to its polyp-removing ability, if you have a negative test, you don’t have to come back for another 10 years. There is indirect evidence it reduces colorectal cancer deaths, in the form of a large study following people who did and didn’t get the test over time. And it seems logical that if sigmoidoscopy cuts colorectal cancer deaths, the more extensive colonoscopy must provide a similar benefit. But that’s not yet been proved by randomized controlled trials. Based on the available evidence and its modeling, the USPSTF estimates it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by 22-24 per 1,000 people screened.

But that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. “They were very clear: We’re going to stick to the evidence, and right now we don’t have evidence for colonoscopy,” said Aasma Shaukat, section chief of gastroenterology in the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.

Colonoscopy also has plenty of downsides. It’s expensive, running upward of $1,000. (The test is covered without cost sharing as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.) Most people prefer to have sedation during the procedure, which means time off from work and finding a ride home. There’s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who’s doing it. There’s a small but real risk of harm, such as a perforation.

So why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? For many, because they’ve been told it’s the best test to get. A 2012 study found primary care physicians overwhelmingly said they thought it was the best colorectal screening option. Katie Couric’s on-air colonoscopy in March 2000 boosted awareness and increased colonoscopy rates. There’s also a “more is better” attitude when it comes to medicine among many people, said Shaukat. And colonoscopies are well-reimbursed for the physicians who perform them. Hospitals have focused on marketing colonoscopies rather than alternative tests.

No one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test. It just hasn’t been shown to be better than an annual FIT, said James Allison, a clinical professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco. He said the public health message is slowly changing to reflect that. The 80% by 2018 campaign from the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, for example, which aims to increase the rate of screening, emphasizes a suite of options. “People are very motivated to get screened when they hear colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death and if they know there are tests that are affordable and can be done at home,” said Wender.

So if you want a colonoscopy after talking with your physician and digging into all its pros and cons — fantastic. But if you prefer something less invasive but more frequent, you can test your poop every year without feeling like you’re opting for, um, No. 2.",You Could Skip Your Colonoscopy If You’re Willing To Collect Your Poop,5,Cancer
story_reviews_00384,"Many heart doctor will tell you that one of the best ways to keep your heart healthy is to include more healthy oils, such as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, in your diet. Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can’t necessarily be true of those who take supplements—see this piece “Fish Oil Is Hugely Popular—But Should You Take It? for more on that).

One thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women’s Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it’s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack.

For the study, published in the journal Circulation, they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That’s a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing.

Normally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart’s normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue’s ability to do its job.

Kwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What’s more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring — 13% — compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications.

“The omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,” says Kwong.

Based on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack.

It’s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart after a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be.

Kwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?

These are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. “To say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,” he says. “But I do think it’s logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack.”

story_reviews_00385,"Brynne Henn, 26, leaned back onto a pristine white couch and settled white-and-red headphones over her ears. She picked up a handset, grasping one buzzer in each hand, closed her eyes, and the session began.

The room was quiet. Through the headphones, Henn heard an alternating tone — first in the right ear, then the left, back and forth. The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died.

Nate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck. Nate was only 25 when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life.

The years hadn’t diminished Brynne Henn’s pain.

“ ‘Your brother’s dead, and you need to come home to take care of your mom,’ ” she remembered her father saying. With those simple words, her brother was gone — and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos. Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C.

“I didn’t stop for the first week after Nate died,” she said.

The ordeal didn’t end with the news of Nate’s death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.

“And then the media storm went crazy,” Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate’s death; Kyle’s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.

“It made it so much worse,” Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. “I felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,” she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.

Complicated grief

When a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations.

When Henn’s traumatic memories of her brother’s violent death were triggered, they “popped” and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen.

“All these memories around me started playing like a video loop,” Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral.

Henn did cognitive behavioral therapy — a form of conventional talk therapy — for five years.

“It helped me realize feelings were normal,” she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. “But I never felt like I was getting over it.” Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn’t address the root cause.

Henn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events — not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda.

It was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR.

Psychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners.

Some therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another.

Patients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.

The idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.

Studies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook “Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.” “The question is whether stimulation adds to it.” He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.

Brynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin’s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.

The techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother’s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.

Some insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn’s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.

Henn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.

“It is so weird,” she said. “When I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones — I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?”

But Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. “I started getting really interested in it,” she said. “Why is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?” Henn was surprised by the vivid memories — some of which she hadn’t known existed — that resurfaced after so much time had passed.

Reliving the memories

It didn’t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, “you have to go through it again until it has no meaning.” By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.

“It’s integrating what’s stuck in time,” explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. “EMDR processing is untangling the knot.”

Once the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.

EMDR’s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure — an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.

“I’m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,” Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.

Soon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a “full-fledged panic attack,” she said.

“I was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,” she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.

“The thought came into my head: ‘I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,’ ” Henn remembered. “And I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth” — actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.

“It took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,” she said. “But the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.”

In a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother’s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate’s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.

“Does EMDR deal with the future?” she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.

Among the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory — friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family — and a smile broke through the tears.

“It felt like a gift from Nate,” she said.

EMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.

“I’m still sad, but I’m not hurt by it anymore,” she said. “It’s not opening up any fresh wounds.”

LONDON (AP) — If you spend all day sitting on your rear end, then you might want to schedule some time for a brisk walk — just make sure you can spare at least an hour.

Scientists analyzing data from more than 1 million people found that it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ""moderate intensity"" exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day. Not exercising and sitting all day is as dangerous as being obese or smoking, they found.

And the added risk of parking yourself in front of a television for 5 hours or more a day after sitting at the office is so high even the hour of exercise is not enough to reverse the damage.

""We cannot stress enough the importance of getting exercise, whether it's getting out for a walk at lunchtime, going for a run in the morning or cycling to work,"" said Ulf Ekelund of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Norway, one of the study authors, in a statement.

It has been long suspected that sitting a lot, at work or at home, is not healthy. Previous studies have found that prolonged sitting can raise the chances of heart disease, various cancers and an earlier death.

In the new research , experts combed through 13 papers with data on factors including how long people spend sitting, their physical activity levels and their television-watching habits. The majority of studies included people older than age 45. All except one were done in the U.S., Western Europe and Australia.

Researchers found that people with the highest levels of moderate physical activity — 60 to 75 minutes daily— erased the higher risk of death linked to being seated for more than eight hours a day. But even that exercise regime was not enough to counter the hazards of also watching more than five hours of television a day.

The paper was published online Wednesday in the journal Lancet.

Lars Bo Andersen, who co-authored an accompanying commentary, called the new research ""very convincing,"" explaining that too much sitting increases the risk of problems including diabetes and heart disease because it can make insulin levels spike and might slow the body's metabolism.

Andersen said that watching lots of television was probably even worse than sitting at the office all day because it likely includes other unhealthy habits.

""A lot of people don't just watch TV, they eat fatty snacks at the same time,"" said Andersen, of Sogn and Fjordane University College in Norway.

Andersen said that some cultures make it easier than others to squeeze in an hour of exercise every day, noting that in Denmark and much of Scandinavia, about half of all people either cycle or walk to work. But he said that getting the recommended amount of physical activity shouldn't be overly arduous and doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym for an intense work-out.

""If you are walking and can feel yourself getting a little warm and your breathing is a little heavier, that's enough,"" he said. ""You don't have to be sweaty and out of breath to get the benefits.""","To reverse damage of sitting, take a brisk, hour-long walk",4,Associated Press

“It was really bad,” Joyce, 29, told FoxNews.com. “I was just itchy all the time and sneezing all the time. I was really uncomfortable and miserable.”

Joyce tried over-the-counter medications but couldn’t find relief. She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place.

The toothpaste, called Allerdent, works to keep breath fresh and fight cavities while also offering the same benefits as an allergy shot or drops. Researchers found that applying the extracts found in a shot to the lining of a patient’s mouth worked just as well to alleviate symptoms.

“The patients who came in were treated for the very things that they were sensitive to, and that included indoor allergens, like dustmite and pet dander, as well as outdoor allergens such as tree pollen, grass pollen, ragweed pollen,” Dr. William Reisacher, an associate professor of otolaryngology and director of allergy services at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, told FoxNews.com.

Joyce, who lives in the Bronx, New York, signed on for the year-long study that required six of the 12 volunteers to brush their teeth for two minutes using two pumps of the toothpaste in either the morning or night, and the other six to use drops under their tongue. Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.

Both groups reported a significant decrease in their symptoms, including Joyce, who was in the toothpaste group.

Allerdent is not covered by insurance, meaning Joyce spends about $400 every three months but said the cost is worth it.

“I used to be so irritable because I was so uncomfortable,” Joyce said. “But now I don’t really feel allergy symptoms anymore.”

story_reviews_00388,"Anxiety disorders plague more than one in four adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18, and many of them are treated with antidepressants and other medications to try and help them live a relatively healthy childhood. But a team of researchers from the University of Cincinnati set out to explore other treatment options that focus more on the mind and less on pharmaceutical solutions.

Their study, published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, recruited nine participants who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders between 9 and 16 years of age. These conditions included generalized, social, and separation anxiety disorder as well as having a parent with bipolar disorder. Over the course of 12 weeks, each participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while they practiced mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a wide range of theraputic techiniques that include meditation, yoga, and learning how to pay nonjudgmental attention to one's life.

""These integrative approaches expand traditional treatments and offer new strategies for coping with psychological distress,” said the study’s co-author Sian Cotton, director of the UC's Center for Integrative Health and Wellness, in a statement. ""Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions promote the use of meditative practices to increase present-moment awareness of conscious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in an effort to manage negative experiences more effectively.”

Children who are at a high risk for bipolar disorder or other anxiety disorders, such as the participants, often have poor coping skills when confronted by stress, and only a lucky few get help. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 80 percent of children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder and 60 percent of those diagnosed with depression do not receive treatment. Some mental health professionals have suggested that mindfulness exercises can help bridge the treatment gap, and there is some encouraging, if early, evidence showing that these techniques can be used to prevent relapses of depression or anxiety.

Cotton noted the anxiety of their patients was significantly reduced following treatment, and the more mindfulness they practiced, the less anxious they felt. Both findings reaffirm the potential that mindfulness therapy could bring to the table. If nothing else, it might allow people who would be reluctant to take medication more treatments to choose from. ""Increasingly, patients and families are asking for additional therapeutic options, in addition to traditional medication-based treatments, that have proven effectiveness for improved symptom reduction. Mindfulness-based therapies for mood disorders is one such example with promising evidence,"" said Cotton, adding the university is both studying and implenting these therapies.

After the 12-week experiment, Cotton and his colleagues found mindfulness therapy increased neural activity in a part of the brain that plays in a role in processing cognitive and emotion information known as the cingulate. The therapy was also able to increase brain activity in the insula, a part of the brain that helps monitor how the body feels psychologically.

""This raises the possibility that treatment-related increases in brain activity during emotional processing may improve emotional processing in anxious youth who are at risk for developing bipolar disorder,” said fellow co-author Dr. Jeffrey Strawn, a professor in UC's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, as well as director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program, in a statement. ""The path from understanding the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity to the identification of treatment response is a challenging one, and will require additional studies of emotional processing circuits.”

story_reviews_00389,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy people by 48 percent, U.S. researchers said on Sunday in reporting an analysis of the results of a 10-year study.

The preliminary findings, presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto, are the first to show that any kind of intervention could delay the development of dementia in normal, healthy adults.

To date, cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists have largely rejected evidence that computer-based cognitive-training software or “brain games” have any effect on cognitive function.

The new findings would be quite promising if they hold up through peer review and publication in a scientific journal, said Dr. John King, an expert in social research at the National Institute of Aging. The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.

King worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based. The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults.

Participants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing.

In the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly. The program got harder with each correct answer.

Participants had 10 one-hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks. Some received four additional “booster” sessions one year after the original training, and four more two years after that.

Scientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one, two, three, five and 10 years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks.

Results of that study, published in 2014, found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed-of-processing groups, but not memory.

The new analysis was by Dr. Jerri Edwards of the University of South Florida, whose mentor, Dr. Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, sold her rights to the program to Posit Science. Edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of 2008.

The program is now incorporated in Posit Science’s BrainHQ.com brain training program.

Edwards did a secondary analysis of the 10-year data, looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia.

She found that the group that did speed training showed 33 percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group, while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit.

People who completed 11 or more speed training sessions were at 48 percent less risk for developing dementia over the 10 years of the study, Edwards said.

“At first blush, that’s kind of a big deal,” Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s expert Dr. Ronald Petersen said. “This may even be clinically relevant.”

In 2014, a group of nearly 70 neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at Stanford University’s Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development signed a letter saying there was “little evidence” of such results from brain games. The letter was in response to heavy marketing by companies touting the benefits of their programs based on scant scientific data.

Edwards said she was frustrated with the scientific debate, which is one reason she agreed to present her findings before they were published. “I’m sick of our studies being ignored,” she said.

King said the training offered in the program was slightly different from the current Posit Science offering and that it was unclear whether speed training would help people who are already at risk for dementia.

“It’s a promising result from an interesting data set,” he said. “I do think we will know more after the paper is reviewed.”",'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study,3,Alzheimer's

Getting pregnant can be tricky. One way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she’s most fertile, a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes. And certain body-tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics, like your heart rate and body temperature. Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women’s health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's annual meeting this month.

“It’s a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.”

The advantage of a passive sensor is ""these things are done kind of autonomously so you don't need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,"" Clue's head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana Högqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. ""It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.""

Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest. And Ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive.

Fitbit

How an Activity Tracker Caught an Unexpected Pregnancy Fitness trackers, by nature of being worn around the clock, have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works — and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days. That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue’s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn’t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman’s resting heart rate changes when she’s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That’s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue’s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman’s “fertile window” — when she’s likeliest to get pregnant — usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.

Clue

As the researchers had hypothesized, the participants' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, Högqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue’s marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. Högqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife’s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor’s suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue’s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, Högqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems.

Manually figuring out your fertile days is a laborious, multi-step process you have to do every single day.

However, Högqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit — so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you’re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn’t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (Högqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)

One reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit’s heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices’ ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone’s resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. “You will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,” said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne.

Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days, a study in Atherosclerosis found.

For the study, researchers evaluated 37 children ages 9 to 18 who were obese and at high risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. The children were given food and drinks totaling the same number of calories, fat, protein and carbohydrates as their typical diets.

The only change was their sugar intake: The researchers swapped foods high in added sugars, like pastries and sweetened yogurts, for options like bagels and pizza. This lowered dietary sugar from 28 percent to 10 percent, and fructose from 12 percent to 4 percent of total calories.

After nine days, the researchers found a 33 percent drop in triglycerides, a type of fat tied to heart disease; a 49 percent reduction in a protein called apoC-III that is tied to high triglyceride levels; and large reductions in small, dense LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease.

Though this study is small and short-term, it builds on this group’s previous research implicating added sugars as a contributor to metabolic disorders and heart disease.

“Sugar calories are not like other carbohydrate calories,” said Dr. Robert Lustig, a co-author of the study and professor of pediatrics at Benioff Children’s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco. “Without changing total carbohydrate, or fat, or protein, we were able to accomplish this enormous improvement in their cardiovascular risk factors,” unrelated to weight loss, he said.",Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers,3,New York Times

Special for USA TODAY

Alex Pierce, 25, took up distance running with great enthusiasm a couple of years ago. Then she developed knee pain so severe that she could not climb stairs.

So Pierce, a doctoral student in food science, went to see physical therapist Matt Briggs at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. He performed deep massages, suggested changes in her running form and taught her how to exercise her thigh and gluteal muscles to better protect her knees. She believes all of that helped.

But Pierce, like a growing number of patients, had another treatment she is convinced helped even more. It’s called ""dry needling,"" and it involves the insertion of thin, non-medicated solid needles into muscles or connective tissues. Proponents say it can reduce pain and improve movement. Pierce has had the procedure more than half a dozen times and believes it is one reason she will be able to run her fourth marathon in November.

“This has kind of changed my life,” she says.

Testimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. But testimonials are not scientific proof.

And there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, “the quality of the evidence is not strong.” That’s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in “runner’s knee,” the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.

For now, here’s what consumers should know:

Is this acupuncture?

Physical therapists say it is not, “though superficially, it may look the same,” says Justin Elliott, vice president of government affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association. For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine — there’s no talk about redirecting the body’s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body. Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.

Elliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.

Acupuncturists beg to differ. “What is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture” and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.

Burgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice.



How might it work?

One theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax. The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.

Another possibility: It’s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself. To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don’t pierce the skin.

Mark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine — a website critical of alternative medicine — says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn’t “come with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.” But he says it may well be a “theatrical placebo.”

What do published studies say?

“It’s a mixed bag,” Elliott says. In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies. A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005. It found they “may be useful” additions to standard treatment. But it said higher quality studies were needed.

What are the risks?

Needling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, “it’s a very safe procedure,” Briggs says.

In rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.

Will insurers pay for this?

Many will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.

Do all physical therapists offer this?

No. The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws. They are: California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, New York, South Dakota and Washington.

And most of the nation’s 200,000 licensed physical therapists are not trained in the technique. About 6,000 have taken courses in dry needling in the past few years, Zylstra says.",'Dry needling' for pain therapy is under scrutiny,4,USA Today
story_reviews_00393,"When U.S. Marine Chris Merkle returned from his last tour of duty in Afghanistan, his family was thrilled to have him back.

But for Merkle, the welcome home was also accompanied by some dark problems. He couldn’t sleep. He was irritable and had anger issues. He would avoid certain stressful situations, like driving in traffic. And he would stay on high alert in the classroom.

“And then soon, they’re like, 'You’re not the same,'” Merkle recalled of what his family told him. “They start to notice that you’re not really enjoying the parties of our friends. You only get really excited when you're going to visit former Marines and the people you used to hang out with.”

Chris Merkle

Merkle served three tours in Iraq and four in Afghanistan. Re-adjusting to being a civilian was tough, he said, and he was finding it difficult to function.

“There was almost 5, 10 years of deploying back and forth back and forth -- there was this void, this monster in the room that’s not talked about until finally it came out. It was like, 'You need to see somebody. Something is going on with you.'""

While Merkle was a patient at the VA, he heard of a clinical psychologist named Skip Rizzo at the University of Southern California Institute of Creative Technologies. Merkle was trying traditional one-on-one therapy and said that at the time, “it wasn’t really taking that well.” He was looking for an alternative and heard about Skip’s research that used a new and unexpected way to treat post-traumatic stress disorder -- with virtual reality.

Nearly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD during a given year, according to the National Center for PTSD. The condition can occur after someone has been exposed to a significant stressor and often includes symptoms such as avoidance, hyper-vigilance, anger issues and mood swings. One common method for treatment is called “exposure therapy.” The patient recounts their trauma, visualizing it in their imagination, and narrates it to a clinician. By repeatedly confronting and processing the trauma, the brain can start to reduce the level of anxiety and response to those memories.

That’s exactly the approach Rizzo uses with virtual reality therapy.

“My mission is to drag psychology kicking and screaming into the 21st century,” Rizzo said, noting that virtual reality offers a unique opportunity for clinicians and clients alike: to be immersed in the environment that evokes the original trauma, rather than relying on the patient’s imagination.

Rizzo has created 14 virtual “worlds” for patients, and clinicians can add custom elements, including helicopters, clouds, small-arms fire and missiles.

USC Institute for Creative Technologies

“The first thing to keep in mind is that we are never going to replicate an exact simulation of what the patient went through,” Rizzo said. “But we really don’t need to.”

Merkle explained how the virtual reality experience works. “Your brain assumes, 'OK, this must be where we’re at,' and it fills in the blanks. And as you’re talking through it, you feel like you’re physically there.”

Each session lasts for about an hour and a half, and the patient speaks about their experience with a clinician as they go through the virtual simulation.

For Merkle, virtual reality allowed him to start unlocking memories and work through his trauma.

“So, it really allowed me to open the door and begin my healing process,” he said. “I’m still a work in process obviously but I’m so far forward, leaps and bound beyond where I would have been without virtual reality.”

story_reviews_00394,"The Ache: Nearly 5,000 people a year die from choking in the U.S., according to the nonprofit National Safety Council.

The Claim: Two new easy-to-use devices work like plungers to suck out obstructions in the airway, providing another option if standard treatment—such as abdominal thrusts developed in 1974 by Henry Heimlich —fail to clear the airway, say the companies who sell them.

The Verdict: A recently published laboratory study showed the LifeVac, from LifeVac LLC of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., dislodged simulated obstructions. So far there haven’t been any scientific publications detailing lives saved with the LifeVac or another device, from Dechoker LLC, of Salisbury, N.C.

Both the Dechoker, $89.95, and the LifeVac, $69.95, have a plastic mask that provides a seal over the mouth and nose while suction is provided. The Dechoker looks like a large syringe, while the LifeVac’s plunger is shaped like a small accordion. In both devices, one-way valves allow air to only travel out of the mask and not into it, which avoids pushing the object deeper in, says LifeVac Chief Executive Arthur Lih.

While the devices “theoretically” could work, there isn’t enough evidence for them, says New Orleans physician Jay Kaplan, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. There are a number of potential pitfalls, including whether a panicking choking victim would let a rescuer put a mask on the mouth, he adds.

The Dechoker looks like a large syringe. Photo: DECHOKER

Early adopters of the devices include people with chronic diseases at high risk for choking. “This is a very simple device which people can have on hand,” says Port Charlotte, Fla., neurologist William Holt. He says he recommends the LifeVac to his multiple-sclerosis patients, as the disease interferes with the muscular coordination involved in swallowing. Dr. Holt says he works as a volunteer adviser to LifeVac but has no financial link to the company.

Skeptics include Dr. Heimlich, now 96. Such a device may not be handy in the “unexpected instance that a person chokes,” Dr. Heimlich, a retired thoracic surgeon from Cincinnati, says in a statement released by his son, Phil Heimlich. “Any action that delays use of the Heimlich maneuver or complicates the rescue can be deadly.”

If a person is choking and isn’t able to cough out the obstruction, the American Heart Association recommends a rapid sequence of abdominal thrusts. If that doesn’t work, or if you can’t get your arms around the victim, due to obesity or pregnancy, another option is thrusting around the chest area, adds Clifton Callaway, chairman of the AHA’s Emergency Cardiovascular Care committee. The American Red Cross recommends using five back blows, followed by five abdominal thrusts, repeating as needed.

The LifeVac and the Dechoker are both intended to be used if standard rescue treatments fail, the companies say. One person can get the device while another person starts the Heimlich maneuver, suggests Sean Pittman, Dechoker’s director of strategic development.

The American Heart Association, which last updated its guidelines on choking rescue in 2010, looks for published reports in scientific journals that a technique has a record of successful uses before recommending it, the group says.

A recently published study showed that the LifeVac dislodged simulated obstructions. Photo: Lifevac

On the market less than two years, neither LifeVac nor Dechoker has published evidence of successful uses in humans. Two users have told Dechoker that the device successfully dislodged an obstruction, says Mr. Pittman. In a recent case of an elderly woman in Wales, the LifeVac removed an obstruction after standard treatments failed, says Mr. Lih. The company doesn’t yet have full details on the case, he adds.

In a study published online in March in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine, the LifeVac successfully removed test obstructions made of clay from the upper airway of a cadaver. “It worked 49 out of 50 times on the first try,” says study co-author Mimi Juliano, a Farmingdale, N.Y., speech pathologist who specializes in swallowing disorders. The one time the device failed on the first try, researchers didn’t have a good seal around the mouth, she says; it worked the second time.",Can New Devices Match Heimlich to Stop Choking?,5,Wall Street Journal
story_reviews_00395,"Could root canal procedures go by the wayside in the not-too-distant future?

Scientists from the University of Nottingham and Harvard University's Wyss Institute hope so. They're developing a new treatment strategy that could someday help heal a damaged tooth using the patient's own stem cells.

Though the work is still in its early stages, and has not yet been tested in people, the scientists won an award from the Royal Society of Chemistry for their idea: regenerative dental fillings.

When dental pulp disease and injury happen, a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues, explained Dr. Adam Celiz, Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham.

Instead of the current dental materials used on fillings, which are toxic to cells, the new approach harnesses stem cells instead.

""What we found is a material that can potentially regenerate components of a patients' tooth,"" Celiz told CBS News.

""We're trying to provide an alternative material, an alternative therapy,"" he said, because the current method involves the dentist removing all of the infected pulp tissue, ""scraping it out, and it can be very painful.""

The process works by stimulating native stem cells inside teeth, triggering repair and regeneration of pulp tissues.

""We hope to eventually encourage dentin regeneration. Dentin is the protective layer that sits on top of the pulp tissue. It's a barrier between enamel and the soft tissue that contains all the blood vessels and cells,"" Celiz explained.

CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook put it in simple terms: ""The cells in the area of a root canal, in the pulp, those are normally asleep. It's like this material goes over and just taps it on the shoulder and says, 'Wake up, wake up,' and then it starts to repair itself.""

The stem cell procedure is in the earliest stages of development, said Celiz.

""We have tested it in cell cultures and we're moving it along into rodents,"" he said. ""It's hard to put timeline on it, but we're talking years before we test it in humans.""

""We're hoping this approach can bring regenerative medicine into the dentistry field,"" said Celiz.

FRIDAY, July 8, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Some cancer patients who take cholesterol-lowering statins may live longer than those not on these heart medications, a study from Britain suggests.

While it did not prove a cause-and-effect connection, the study of nearly 1 million cancer patients found that those taking statin drugs such as Lipitor and Crestor appeared to have:

a 22 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer,

a 43 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer,

a 47 percent lower risk of dying from prostate cancer,

and a 30 percent lower risk of dying from colon cancer.

""We need to further investigate the reasons for patients with high cholesterol having improved mortality in four of the most common cancers,"" said senior researcher Dr. Rahul Potluri, a clinical lecturer at Aston University School of Medicine in Birmingham.

Potluri cautioned, however, that this study can't prove that statins actually extended life in cancer patients.

At this time, people without high cholesterol should not be taking statins in the hope of warding off cancer or living longer with cancer, he said.

""People with high cholesterol should be taking statins to lower their cholesterol and reduce their cardiovascular risk,"" he said. ""We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial.""

For the study, Potluri and colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients listed in a clinical database from January 2000 to March 2013. The database includes information on cancer and other medical conditions, including high cholesterol. Data on deaths was obtained from the U.K. Office for National Statistics.

Among the patients in the study, nearly 8,000 had lung cancer, 5,500 had breast cancer, 4,600 had prostate cancer and 4,500 had colon cancer, the researchers found.

After adjusting for factors that might play a role in dying, such as age, gender, ethnicity and common causes of death, the researchers found those taking statins lived longer than those who were not taking them.

The results were to be presented Friday at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Florence, Italy. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

One expert doesn't think sufficient evidence exists yet to take statins to prevent or treat cancer.

""Regardless of whether or not a person has cancer, statin use should be discussed with a health care provider,"" said Eric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society.

""There is little evidence that statins affect cancer risk or survival, but clear evidence that they can help some people lower risk of heart attacks and strokes,"" he said.

Dr. Richard Niederman, the chairman of the epidemiology and health promotion department at the New York University College of Dentistry, said, “Being able to paint it on in 30 seconds with no noise, no drilling, is better, faster, cheaper.”

“I would encourage parents to ask for it,” he added. “It’s less trauma for the kid.”

The main downside is aesthetic: Silver diamine fluoride blackens the brownish decay on a tooth. That may not matter on a back molar or a baby tooth that will fall out, but some patients are likely to be deterred by the prospect of a dark spot on a visible tooth.

story_reviews_00398,"An experimental drug touted as a breakthrough for treating severe postpartum depression is showing some promising results in a small clinical trial.

Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), based in Cambridge, Mass., reported on Tuesday that 7 of the 10 women who took the drug in the trial experienced significant improvement in their depression within 60 hours of the injection. That effect was maintained for 30 days.

Among the 11 women who took the placebo, just one experienced remission within 60 hours.

advertisement

Interestingly, none of the patients who took the drug reported psychiatric side effects, such as abnormal dreams, insomnia, and anxiety — but 5 of the 11 women on the placebo reported such symptoms. A few patients in each group experienced dizziness or a sedative effect.

Sage’s drug is designed to change the traffic patterns in the brain. There’s a natural push and pull between neurotransmitters called NMDA receptors and the GABA receptors that regulate their flow in the brain. In cases of severe depression, that equilibrium gets out of whack, and Sage’s drug is meant to restore it, modulating those GABA receptors to allow NMDA to do its job.

The data could represent a “paradigm shift in how the disease is thought about,” CEO Jeff Jonas said in a conference call.

But before anyone shifts anything, Sage will need more data. The early results are “promising and exciting,” said Dr. Allison Baker, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Women’s Mental Health, but “we need to see replication of this data over a much wider range in terms of numbers.”

The study is small and has not been peer-reviewed; Sage disclosed the results in a press release. The company has not submitted study data to federal regulators and isn’t at this point seeking approval of the drug, known as SAGE-547, for postpartum depression. Its next steps: expanding the trial to enroll more women and to determine optimum doses.

“I think it’s incumbent upon us … to find a lower dose that might be just as useful,” especially for nursing mothers, Jonas said.

Women in the trial were asked not to breastfeed for the first 10 days after receiving the injection. The drug has a “very, very short half-life” in the body, Jonas said, meaning that it can be metabolized quickly.

The company is also testing SAGE-547 as a treatment for a rare form of epilepsy. It’s in late-stage trials on that front. It’s also working on an oral form of the drug.

Though preliminary, the early results on postpartum depression are tantalizing. One of the drug’s most promising features: It appears to work quickly — some women in the study started experiencing relief after 24 hours. By contrast, traditional antidepressants can take weeks to begin working. The only other treatment for postpartum depression is talk therapy.

SAGE-547’s apparent speed is what’s getting the most attention in the psychiatric community, Baker said. In the early days of motherhood, women ideally build competency and confidence in their parenting. Dealing with postpartum depression derails that process, and it’s linked to increased rates of anxiety and mood disorders among children, she said.

“If we could essentially nip those within 60 hours or even 24 hours and then keep that at bay for at least 30 days, that’s pretty compelling when you think of the alternative,” Baker said.

A serious mood disorder that affects as many as 1 in 7 women after childbirth, postpartum depression can lead to panic attacks, inconsolable sadness, and deep feelings of inadequacy. Some women have thoughts of harming their baby or themselves.

Jonas, a Harvard-trained psychiatrist, has long experience working with treatments for mental illnesses such as depression. He wrote the book “Everything You Need To Know About Prozac” in the early 1990s, in part to counter fear-mongering about the antidepressant.

story_reviews_00399,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said on Tuesday they approved a stent by Abbott Laboratories that is the first designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream after it is implanted.

The stent, called Absorb, is made of a plastic similar to dissolving sutures and offers patients an alternative to metal stents currently used to prop open arteries cleared of blockages.

Unlike traditional stents that remain in place after implantation, Absorb is designed to disappear fully within three years of the procedure.

Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. The approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades, said Mitchell Krucoff, a professor at Duke University Medical Center who has advised Abbott on Absorb.

“This is a game changer,” he said in an interview. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.”

Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said.

“No metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities,” said Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center, who led clinical trials for Absorb. “No metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents.”

Data released in October concluded Absorb was comparable to Abbott’s own Xience drug-coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it.

Absorb also will compete with Medtronic Plc’s traditional drug-coated Resolute stent and Boston Scientific Corp’s Synergy and Promus stents. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place.

Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton. Absorb will be priced at a “modest” premium to Xience, he said. Analysts have predicted Absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug-dispensing metal stents such as Xience in share until longer-term data show more favorable clinical results.",Abbott wins U.S. approval for stent that absorbs into body,3,heart disease
story_reviews_00400,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A medical implant that slowly dissolves into the body could be the answer to long-standing safety concerns with devices used to treat clogged arteries.

But not so fast, say experts.

Abbott Laboratories' newly approved Absorb stent comes with one important caveat: it hasn't yet been shown to be safer than older metal implants.

The Food and Drug Administration approved the device Tuesday for patients with coronary artery disease, the artery-narrowing condition that causes about 370,000 U.S. deaths each year, according to government figures. The new stent is designed to gradually dissolve over three years.

Currently-available stents are permanent, mesh-wire tubes that hold open arteries after a procedure used to clear fatty plaque.

Experts describe Abbott's device as an important step in finding a better approach to treating the leading cause of death in the U.S.

""This is presumably a better technology going forward, at least that's the theory, but it will take years to prove,"" said Dr. George Vetrovec, professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University. Vetrovec was part of an FDA advisory panel of cardiologists who overwhelmingly endorsed the device in March.

The Absorb stent, already sold in Europe and Asia, is made of a degradable material that's designed to stay intact for one year then break down over the next two years.

Use of metallic stents surged in the early 2000s as a treatment for people who suffered a heart attack or experienced chest pain caused by clogged arteries that restrict blood flow. They are still implanted in about 850,000 U.S. patients annually.

But doctors have scaled back their use due to safety concerns, insurance cost-cutting and evidence that they are overused. Studies in 2007 and 2008 suggested that stented arteries faced a higher risk of blood clots, potentially triggering heart attack a year or more down the road. Results of another five-year study showed that patients who received stents to treat chest pain fared about as well as those treated with drugs.

Amid these concerns, Abbott and others began developing dissolving stents that would slowly melt away like stitches, presumably reducing complications.

In the company study submitted to the FDA, patients who got Absorb fared about as well as those receiving Abbott's older metal stent after one year. But heart-related complications were actually slightly higher with Absorb - 7.8 percent of patients, versus 6.1 percent of patients with the metal stent. That 1.7 percent difference is not considered statistically significant.

Other complications with the new device include allergic reactions, infections and internal bleeding.

Doctors who studied Absorb said it may take several years before its advantages become clear. Long-term safety results aren't expected until 2020.

""We have good theoretical reasons to believe that by getting rid of the stent, and allowing the coronary artery to restore its normal shape, that will prevent many of those late events,"" said Dr. Gregg Stone, of Columbia University Medical Center, who helped conduct the pivotal trial of Absorb. Stone was not paid by Abbott for his work on the trial.

Some Wall Street analysts are betting that products like Absorb will allow companies to raise prices and boost revenue.

""The key for the stent market will be whether pricing returns to rational levels and the success of the new bio-absorbable stent platforms,"" states Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar, in an investment note. He says a ""perfect storm of events,"" including safety concerns and the economic downturn led Abbott and competitors Medtronic Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp. to slash prices in recent years.

Stent sales fell roughly 30 percent to $4.1 billion in 2014 from 2006 levels, according to Evercore.

Abbott said it does not disclose the price of its stents. Hospitals often bill $30,000 for stenting procedures, which includes the costs of the stent, medical staff and other equipment and services.

story_reviews_00401,"Genomic Health Inc. has struck a deal to commercialize a new blood test that can help advanced prostate cancer patients decide whether to try costly new-generation drugs or rely on much cheaper traditional chemotherapy to improve their chances for survival.

The test, developed by closely held Epic Sciences Inc., San Diego, detects a mutation associated with a poor response to two new drugs, Xtandi from Medivation Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. ALPMY -0.78% of Japan, and Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson.

The two blockbuster drugs have significantly extended survival for many patients with advanced prostate cancer. But in a study published last month, patients who tested positive for the anomaly—a variant of the androgen receptor called AR-V7—lived substantially longer if they were treated with chemotherapy than those given the two new drugs. The receptor is the target of the new drugs.

“If AR-V7 was present, the patients didn’t respond to the [new] agents,” said Howard Scher, chief of genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. “They progressed more quickly and they didn’t live as long” as those treated with chemo. Dr. Scher is lead author of the study, which was published online by the journal JAMA Oncology.

The findings suggest that patients with the variant can improve their survival chances while avoiding use of the more-costly therapies. Xtandi’s price is $9,370 a month while Zytiga’s is about $8,600. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel, the standard so-called taxane chemotherapies for advanced prostate cancer, cost several hundred dollars a month, researchers said.

“You get both improved clinical outcome and economic benefits to the health system,” said Murali Prahalad, Epic’s president and chief executive.

The retrospective study involved 161 men. Researchers said the test needs further validation in larger, prospective randomized trials. The companies believe the recent study, and previous research linking a poor response to the two drugs to the AR-V7 variant, are sufficient validation for clinical use, said Phil Febbo, Genomic Health’s chief medical officer. They plan to launch the test early next year while more rigorous studies are under way. The price hasn’t been determined.

The companies estimate that about 50,000 U.S. patients a year have advanced prostate cancer that has progressed after standard hormone therapy and would be candidates for the test as they and their doctors consider treatment with the new agents. Studies suggest as many as 20% may have the AR-V7 variant, or acquire it as their tumors change during courses of therapy.

The agreement bolsters Genomic Health’s portfolio of cancer diagnostic tests intended to help doctors tailor treatment based on the molecular traits of their patients’ tumors. Its OncotypeDX line of tests for breast, prostate and colon cancers gives patients with early-stage disease information on whether they’re likely to benefit from chemotherapy—or in the case of the prostate, other aggressive care—as part of their treatment. The new pact is part of Genomic Health’s plan to provide diagnostics to guide treatment for metastatic, or advanced disease.

The test is called a liquid biopsy because it analyzes blood instead of tumor tissue to determine if the mutation is present. It is based on technology that cannot only detect AR-V7 but also determine whether it is in the nucleus of individual tumor cells.

The presence of the AR-V7 in the nucleus is a key factor in whether patients respond to the new drugs, Dr. Scher said. In the study, no patient determined to have the variant in a single tumor cell’s nucleus responded to either Xtandi or Zytiga.

In the study, a positive test for AR-V7 didn’t assure patients would respond to the chemotherapy, nor did a negative test promise a response to the Xtandi or Zytiga.

Under the agreement, which covers commercializing the test in the U.S., Genomic Health is making an equity investment in Epic. Specific financial terms weren’t disclosed.

Qiagen NV of Germany and Tokai Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, are codeveloping an AR-V7 liquid biopsy test based on different technology as a diagnostic test for Tokai’s experimental prostate-cancer drug called galeterone intended to treat men who test positive for AR-V7.

story_reviews_00402,"When I tore my rotator cuff in 2008, I had conventional laparoscopic surgery to repair it. The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn’t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.

So in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.

Cortisone injections and physical therapy didn’t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body’s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.

It may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.

[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]

Before undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.

“[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,’’ says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. “There still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.’’

The procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient’s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.

“PRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,’’ says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. “It releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.’’

A recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.

The researchers call the results “clinically relevant,’’ despite the study’s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. “I’ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,” says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study’s authors. “The potential for benefit from PRP is real.’’

I had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder — the site of the tear — was considerably weaker than my right.

He then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.

Before deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.

I had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder — to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.

After what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.

Ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. “We want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,’’ Ferrell says.

Because there is not yet enough research on PRP — and because some studies have shown mixed results — insurance will not cover it.

Still, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.

With additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient’s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons — which says PRP “holds great promise’’ — describes the risk as minimal.

Those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.

Moreover, “you see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,” he adds.

By February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.

I had it on March 4.

When I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results. The tear was completely gone.","I’ll never go through shoulder surgery again, so here’s what I did",3,Washington Post
story_reviews_00403,"(CNN) Stem cell research can run the gamut from Nobel Prize-winning scientists to hucksters in lab coats making a buck off desperate, seriously ill people. The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.

Dr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.

""We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,"" explained Glass.

In previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.

Next, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome ""must be interpreted with caution"" since the study wasn't designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.

For the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.

What ALS does to the body

When someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.

""I always use the analogy of a house on fire,"" said Robert Goldstein, vice president of the ALS Therapy Development Institute . His nonprofit biotech research company has 25 therapeutic projects in progress, although none of them happens to be stem cell-based. ""The body is deteriorating rapidly.""

Juanita Pharr, director of care for the Georgia Chapter of the ALS Association , has both personal and professional experience with ALS: A medical social worker, she also watched her father die from the disease.

""My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,"" Pharr said.

Neither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr's father.

ALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid.

""He did not want to go on the ventilator,"" she said, adding that many people prefer a ""natural death."" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. ""There's no cure, and we don't even have a treatment,"" she said.

According to Goldstein, this isn't entirely a negative. ""One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,"" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.

Was this research necessary -- and ethical?

The ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.

""Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,"" Glass explained.

In Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, ""patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision."" Besides, she added, ""you automatically assume anyone with ALS can participate, but not everyone meets the criteria for a particular study.""

The results of the study: Most participants fared well. However, severe complications occurred in two of the patients as a result of the surgery involved. One developed partial paralysis, and another experienced ""incapacitating pain.""

""People who do these studies should be considered medical heroes,"" Goldstein said, adding, ""The selflessness of these people when they're told they're gonna die.""

Sadly, disappointment is part of it, according to Pharr, who typically hears the frustration of people who go through a study that worked for another person but not for them. ""It may have had a different effect on someone else,"" she said. ""But that's why we don't have a treatment yet: because it doesn't work for everyone.""

In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Stanley H. Appel and Dr. Carmel Armon wrote, ""These are clearly early stages of evaluating the risks and benefits of transplanting neural progenitor stem cells in patients with ALS.""

These early stages may be painful for some of the ""medical heroes"" involved, but the goal is clear: providing an effective and safe treatment for future patients who suffer from a devastating condition.

story_reviews_00405,"A recent study has found evidence suggesting text messages could reduce one’s odds of a second heart attack.

A six-month clinical trial in Australia found that patients recovering from a heart attack were more likely to maintain lower blood pressure, less body fat and lower cholesterol levels than a control group when the patients received text messages asking and giving suggestions about their health routines. Patients receiving the texts also were more likely to be active and to quit smoking than the patients in the control group, who didn't receive such texts.

Repeat heart attacks make up more than a quarter of all heart attacks in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of these attacks could be prevented by lifestyle changes. But while health systems have gotten very good at treating heart attacks, they struggle to connect with patients recovering from heart attacks after they return home.

In the immediate aftermath of a heart attack, “doctors dump a lot of information onto patients in a few days,” says Clara Chow, leader of the study, who is director of the cardiovascular division at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney and an associate professor at the University of Sydney Medical School. But after the initial flurry, Dr. Chow says, there is often little follow-up to make sure the patients follow through on recommended practices. “Texts allow us to give support in bite-size chunks,” she says.

The six-month study in Australia included about 700 patients with coronary heart disease. Half of the patients received four text messages a week generated by a computer algorithm designed to be encouraging and give helpful advice, such as: “Have you gone for your walk today, Jane?” Or “did you know 90% of people don’t eat the recommended daily intake of vegetables (5 servings a day)?” The other half of the patients received no such texts.

After six months, the difference in blood pressure between the two groups was similar to what would have been achieved using a standard blood-pressure-lowering tablet, says Dr. Chow. She says that the differences in body fat and physical activity were also large—“comparable or greater than [would have been expected if the patients had been] attending a cardiac-rehabilitation program.” The effect on cholesterol level was smaller, less than 20% of what could have been expected if comparing a statin with a placebo, she says.

While many previous studies have looked at the effect of text messaging on certain behaviors, this study stands out, doctors say, because it used objective measures, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, rather than relying entirely on self-reported metrics, which could be biased.

Earlier studies also were often conducted on a smaller scale and over a shorter time—three months or less, says Shivan Mehta, associate chief innovation officer at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. The length of the Australian study was important, Dr. Mehta says, because the first six months after a heart attack are a high-risk period during which new health habits are formed. Another advance, he says, is that the Australian study targeted multiple risk factors concurrently—smoking, exercise, diet and general cardiovascular awareness, rather than focusing on a single behavior.

Dr. Chow is now attempting to replicate her results with a new study over a longer period and using a larger sample size. The new study will be run from more than 15 locations for 12 months and involve 1,400 patients. And unlike the earlier study, in which patients didn’t have the opportunity to text back, this study will encourage participants to send questions to a health counselor. There will also be more focus on encouraging patients to continue taking prescribed medication.

Experts hope that targeted text messages can also help patients with other severe and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and even mental-health illnesses, when patients require continuing support and lifestyle modifications. Texting also may be helpful in countries where patients don’t have easy access to medical support.

Someone has a stroke in the United States every 40 seconds, and it has become the leading cause of serious long-term disability among Americans. That’s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)—a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements.

The hospital recently received the green light from federal authorities to start the first ever human trial of DBS for stroke, and plans to announce Tuesday that it will perform the procedure as soon as an initial patient is identified.

Close to 800,000 Americans have a stroke each year and estimates suggest about half of those people will be disabled from it. With physical therapy, many people regain some motor function, but the brain damage cannot be reversed and many still have profound movement problems.

“Despite advances in physical therapy and acute treatment of stroke there are still too many people who live with long term disabilities, and new technologies are needed,” said Dr. Andre Machado, the chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute who is leading the trial and will perform the procedures.

DBS has been used to treat tremors associated with Parkinson’s disease, but Machado said the new approach, if successful, will achieve something novel. “The big difference is that when we are treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, we’re trying to make the symptom, like a tremor, go away,” he said. “When we are treating stroke, we are really trying to make movement come back. There is something inherently different about that.”

And inherently harder. DBS has never been used on humans as a way to regain a function. And experts aren’t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson’s in the first place. But for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats. They found that rats with strokes who received DBS had more proteins in the brain that are associated with brain plasticity—and twice as many synapses or connections between nerve cells compared to rats with strokes who did not undergo DBS.

If all goes as planned, Machado will insert the electrodes in the brain of someone severely disabled by stroke who has exhausted all other options without improvement. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The electrodes will be attached to a wire that connects them to a battery pack located under the skin in the chest—the pack looks similar to a pacemaker. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain’s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy.

The team will focus on people who suffer ischemic strokes, which is when blood flow to the brain is blocked. About 87% of all strokes are this type.

DBS is a type of brain surgery, and comes with risks like bleeding, infection and need for more surgeries. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. Depending on how the first procedure goes, the hospital will enroll more people into its trial. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation. “The goal of this therapy is not to replace physical training, but rather to boost the effects,” Machado said. “The proposition here is to make that recovery greater.”

story_reviews_00407,"When doctors who treat pregnant women recently met to debate the best time to induce labor, they came up with a surprising answer: 39 weeks — three weeks earlier than currently recommended.

Their organization, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), has not changed its guidelines on late-term pregnancies. The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.

The question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: “Why not induce everyone at 39 weeks?” Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.

[Here’s what’s being done to lower the maternal death rate]

“My original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,” Lockwood said, “was that Dr. Norwitz would take the ‘pro’ side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the ‘con’ side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.”

Charles J. Lockwood found studies suggesting that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce complications in mothers and infants. (University of South Florida)

Norwitz was a vigorous proponent. “There is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,” he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.

“But Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,” Lockwood said. “Beyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.”

After Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.

Before either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.

Norwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.

“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.

And, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. “Stillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,” he said. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”

“There is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,” said Errol Norwitz, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine. (Tufts Medical Center)

Lockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.

Labor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.

Cristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors’ remarks suggest that all babies need to be “rescued by birth,” creating an anti-woman mentality. “It’s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,” said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.

Pascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation “reinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor’s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator — like in the ’50s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.”

Consumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. “It’s disheartening to see how hard that’s going to be for some physicians to do.”

Lockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. “I think a lot of this gets very emotional,” Norwitz said.

Although both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn’t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that “it’s a very healthy discussion to have.”

Due dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman’s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.

As he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.

Still, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.

[I didn’t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]

Traditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn’t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with “unfavorable, long and hard cervixes” — as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction — the risk of Caesarean is increased.

Rebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it “concerning and rash” for doctors at the meeting to make “broad conclusions” that “could potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.”

Norwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. “This is my interpretation of the published literature,” he said. “This is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.”

Lockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.

Dekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. “They still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,” she said.

Dekker isn’t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.

“It’s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,” Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, “Despite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.”

And, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.

For Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.

There are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital’s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. “We midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,” she told him. “Obstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.”

Esther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. “Since we don’t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?”

Hausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)

Dekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.

Beverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.

“What changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,” Siegal said. “I would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.”

Of course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.

“Finally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,” he said.

“But obviously our messages — how you talk — does make a difference,” Norwitz said.",Should pregnant women be induced at 39 weeks?,3,Washington Post
story_reviews_00408,"Like many autistic children, Julian Brown has trouble reading emotions in people's faces, one of the biggest challenges for people with the neurological disorder.

Now the 10-year-old San Jose boy is getting help from ""autism glass"" — an experimental device that records and analyzes faces in real time and alerts him to the emotions they're expressing.

The facial recognition software was developed at Stanford University and runs on Google Glass, a computerized headset with a front-facing camera and a tiny display just above the right eye.

Julian is one of about 100 autistic children participating in a Stanford study to see if ""autism glass"" therapy can improve their ability to interpret facial expressions.

""There's not a machine that can read your mind, but this helps with the emotions, you know, recognizing them,"" Julian said.

Julian wears the device each day for three 20-minute sessions when he interacts with family members face-to-face — talking, playing games, eating meals. The program runs on a smartphone, which records the sessions.

When the device's camera detects an emotion such as happiness or sadness, Julian sees the word ""happy"" or ""sad"" — or a corresponding ""emoji"" — flash on the glass display. The device also tests his ability to read facial expressions.

""The autism glass program is meant to teach children with autism how to understand what a face is telling them. And we believe that when that happens they will become more socially engaged,"" said Dennis Wall, who directs the Stanford School of Medicine's Wall Lab, which is running the study.

Stanford student Catalin Voss and researcher Nick Haber developed the technology to track faces and detect emotions in a wide range of people and settings.

""We had the idea of basically creating a behavioral aide that would recognize the expressions and faces for you and then give you social cues according to those,"" said Voss, who was partly inspired by a cousin who has autism.

Google provided about 35 Google Glass devices to Stanford, but otherwise hasn't been involved in the project. The Silicon Valley tech giant stopped producing the headset last year after it failed to gain traction, but the device found new life among medical researchers.

Brain Power, a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup, is also developing Google Glass-based applications to help children with autism improve their face-reading abilities and social skills.

Autism advocates are excited that researchers are developing technologies to help the estimated one in 68 American children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

""Glass and wearable technology are the future. They're going to play a pivotal role in how we understand, manage and diagnose disorders like autism,"" said Robert Ring, chief science officer at Autism Speaks.

Currently, many autistic children learn to read facial expressions by working with therapists who use flashcards with faces expressing different emotions. The Stanford team hopes autism glass can provide a convenient, affordable therapy that families can do at home.

""Kids with autism are not getting enough of the care that they need for as long as they need it, and we need to fix the problem,"" Wall said.

If the study shows positive results, the technology could become commercially available within a couple years, Wall said.

""Anything that can help this population is very welcome and very important, but even the best technology will never be enough because we are dealing with a population with often very, very profound needs,"" said Jill Escher, president of Autism Society San Francisco Bay Area.

The study is still in its early stages, but Wall said participating children have shown gains in their face-reading abilities and family feedback has been encouraging.

""It has helped our son who's using the Google Glasses connect with the family more,"" said Kristen Brown, Julian's mother. ""I think the glasses are a positive way to encourage a kid to look someone else in the face.""

Julian also gives the device positive reviews: ""I really think it would help autistic people a lot.""",Can Google Glass Help Autistic Children Read Faces?,3,Associated Press
story_reviews_00409,"A cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition marked by progressive, debilitating cognitive decline that affects more than 5.4 million Americans, is the holy grail in disease research. One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.

In a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.

For example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.

The study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.

""Lives have been dramatically impacted,"" Bredesen told CBS News. ""I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.""

James E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. ""It's important to be excited about this approach,"" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, ""I'm not sure about the method.""

The MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.

""Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,"" Galvin told CBS News.

But Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. ""Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,"" he told CBS News. ""It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.""

But even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: ""None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.""

Bredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. ""We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,"" he said.

Bredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.

""If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,"" he said. ""It's about prevention.""

Bredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.

Galvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. ""This is moving in the right direction,"" he told CBS News. ""These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.""",Can memory loss in Alzheimer's patients be reversed?,2,CBS News
story_reviews_00410,"When you learn your child has brain cancer or another aggressive tumor, you're intensely focused on the immediate present. Which course of treatment – what combination of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation – will best help your child survive? But with most kids living long past their cancer diagnosis, it's also important to consider how treatments they undergo now may affect them later, even as adults.

One choice some parents may face is whether to seek a newer type of radiation called proton beam therapy, instead of conventional X-ray radiation, to potentially reduce harmful side effects in their developing child. Proton beam therapy is considered a big advance in cancer therapy by some experts. Others, however, hesitate to get caught up in the early hype without more long-term evidence. Even so, people are traveling far and wide so their children can receive proton therapy from the handful of centers where it's offered.

Four leading radiation oncologists explained to U.S. News what parents should understand about proton therapy and its possible benefits:

Fewer side effects from cancer treatment is a major goal. (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic)

Proton beam therapy is a form of radiation that may reduce late side effects compared with conventional X-ray radiation. The pinpoint beam and lack of exit dose – which is unneeded radiation as the conventional X-ray beam passes beyond the tumor and through the body on its way out the other side – spares healthy, normal tissue in developing areas such as the brain, heart and lungs.

Childhood brain cancer is considered one of the most evidence-based uses for proton therapy. It may prevent late effects such as hearing loss or reduced ability to do well in school. However, at least for now, proton therapy does not offer a higher possibility of cure than traditional X-ray radiation.

The brain is the most common area for kids to develop cancerous tumors that require radiation treatment, says Dr. Torunn Yock, director of pediatric radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.

""Because the pediatric brain is still growing and developing, if you irradiate the brain during this process, it won't continue to grow and develop as it normally would,"" she says. ""And this over time leads to slowing of development, which shows up as drops in neurocognitive testing.""

The younger the child, the more potential exists for stunted development, Yock says. ""A 2-year-old is very different from a 15-year-old in terms of brain development, so the adverse consequences are much greater in the 2-year-old.""

Clearly, there's an advantage to not irradiating healthy brain tissue, she says. For instance, avoiding the brain's vision and auditory centers may save children from loss or impairment of sight or hearing.

Proton beam therapy allows doctors to give the same dose as with traditional radiation, while reducing the dose – and complications – to normal, healthy tissue, says Dr. Sameer Keole, medical director of the proton beam therapy program at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. It also allows the use of a higher dose than traditional X-ray radiation (also called photon radiation) to treat resistant tumors, while still protecting surrounding tissue.

With traditional radiation to the brain, the radiation scatters. ""That collateral radiation exposes large amounts of brain to low doses of radiation,"" says Dr. Thomas Merchant, chair of radiation oncology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Even lower doses of radiation can be harmful, he adds.

In November 2015, the new St. Jude Red Frog Events Proton Therapy Center – the world's only proton-therapy center dedicated solely to the treatment of children – began treating kids with aggressive cancers, including brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma. ""There are certain brain tumors in children where we have to treat the entire brain and spine,"" Merchant says. ""If we give proton therapy, we don't have exit radiation into the chest and abdomen that you have when you treat someone with conventional radiation."" That may reduce long-term side effects in the heart and lungs.

With the newest form of proton therapy, called pencil-beam scanning – which conforms or shapes the highest-dose radiation to the targeted tumor – it's possible to reduce the ""margin"" area around the tumor exposed to radiation, Merchant says. That method, which is used by St. Jude, may eventually have the potential to reduce the risk of secondary cancers.

Dr. Anita Mahajan, a professor and chief of pediatric radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, says when she describes proton therapy to parents, she emphasizes that proton therapy is radiation.

The biggest difference, she explains, is that the subatomic particle, the proton, stops where the oncologists need it to. ""It has to get in, but we can stop it from coming out.""

That ability to avoid other organs is important. ""For instance, if we're treating a young child for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma [a muscle and connective tissue cancer], one of the things we might be able to do is avoid the growth plates in the femurs,"" Mahajan says. ""That might give you less problem with growth asymmetry of the legs as they get older.""

Future fertility is a factor in cancer treatment planning. In cases involving radiation around the pelvic area, it's sometimes possible to avoid the ovaries in a young girl or the testes in a boy.

'Spaceship Hamster Wheel'

A proton is a positively charged atomic particle. In proton therapy, a powerful machine called a particle accelerator speeds protons up to reach a high energy level. The technology is massive – three stories high and weighting upward of 100 tons – requiring special housing within a treatment facility to contain the equipment and deliver the proton beams. A rotating device called a gantry releases protons to the tumor from different angles. You can take a quick virtual tour of proton beam therapy at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona.

In the treatment room, patients are positioned on a table or in a specialized chair. CT or MRI scans are taken before each treatment to ensure accurate positioning. Some children need sedation to sleep through the treatment, while others who can remain still may stay awake.

Patients may need immobilization devices to keep them in the proper, precise position for every proton-beam treatment. With brain cancer, patients usually wear a custom-fitted mask to maintain their position.

Parents can accompany children to the treatment room and see them settle in before treatment begins, Mahajan says. A child life specialist is part of the team to help children and families cope with the entire patient experience.

While the treatment itself is painless, side effects can include skin problems like swelling, dryness, blistering or peeling – similar to traditional radiation. Fatigue, nausea and vomiting are side effects as well and are also due to other treatments patients receive, like chemotherapy.

Meg McQuillan of Riverside, Connecticut, recalls her son's introduction to proton beam therapy three years ago, when he was treated at Mass General for a type of brain tumor called medulloblastoma. He and fellow patients named the device the ""spaceship hamster wheel.""

Young people take the treatment process in stride, Keole says. ""Kids are tough,"" he says. ""Sometimes they're a lot tougher than adults. By and large, they have a great attitude.""

Cost and Access

There are 23 operating proton beam centers in the U.S., according to the National Association for Proton Therapy, unevenly distributed throughout the country. Only a portion exist in the context of a pediatric-focused cancer program. Between 500 and 600 pediatric patients get proton radiation therapy each year, according to Yock's rough estimate.

With a typical treatment course lasting six weeks, families face the disruption of traveling to a children's hospital with a proton therapy center, finding lodging and making arrangements for other children at home.

Proton therapy costs roughly twice as much as traditional X-ray radiation. The average cost for a full course of proton radiation treatment is estimated at $40,000.

Creating a new proton center is a huge investment. ""If you look at simply the upfront costs, it will be three to four times more expensive than photons,"" Yock says. ""It is absolutely intensive in terms of people and equipment needed and the quality assurance and the engineers and the physicists. It's a huge team that's required to run it safely, with good quality control.""

Yock co-authored a study published in December 2015 in the journal Cancer, which compared the cost-effectiveness of proton radiation therapy versus traditional radiation among kids with medulloblastoma. The study, which used models to measure long-term side effects and related costs in treatment, work-force participation and quality of life, found that proton therapy was cost-effective.

As Mahajan says, ""If we can prevent some neurocognitive deficits, endocrine issues, growth issues, skeletal deformities, those are going to help that child be more productive in society and need fewer medical interventions down the road.""

Insurance usually covers the cost of proton therapy when a cancer is considered curable, Yock says: ""Ninety-eight percent of the time, we are successful with arguing to get a pediatric patient treatment,"" she says.",The Promise (and Limits) of Pediatric Proton Radiation,4,Cancer

story_reviews_00412,"WEDNESDAY, June 15, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Reiterating a recommendation last made in 2008, an influential U.S. panel of health experts is advocating that regular colon cancer screening begin at age 50 and continue until at least age 75.

However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another.

""There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. We encourage people to choose the best option for them, in consultation with their clinician,"" former Task Force member Dr. Douglas Owens said Wednesday in a USPSTF news release.

The panel's reticence to choose one option over another may be at odds with the preference of many doctors, who often advise colonoscopy as the ""gold standard"" test.

Dr. Arun Swaminath is one of them.

""There is only one test -- colonoscopy -- that can both diagnose a polyp/cancer and remove or sample it at the same time,"" said Swaminath, who directs the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""This is key, because a positive stool test plus stool DNA test (such as Cologuard), or a positive imaging test (such as CT colonoscopy) will still require a follow up colonoscopy to confirm and treat the problem,"" he explained.

For its part, the American Cancer Society recommends colonoscopy screening once every 10 years, beginning at age 50, or one of a number of other tests at more frequent intervals.

In drafting its updated colon cancer screening guidelines, the USPSTF reviewed data on several screening strategies. Besides colonoscopy, these included flexible sigmoidoscopy (an invasive procedure that penetrates less far than colonoscopy); CT colonography (a scan of the colon); traditional fecal occult blood tests (looking for blood in stool); and the recently approved Cologuard DNA-based stool test.

The panel said there were no comparison studies that suggested that any of the screening methods were any more effective than others. There are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations, the panelists said.

And what about colon cancer screening for the elderly?

In its statement, the panel said that ""for some adults ages 76 to 85, the benefits of screening are smaller, and the potential for harm greater. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found.""

For this older group, the USPSTF recommends that decisions on screening be made during consultations between the patient and his or her doctor.

All of the recommendations are specific to symptom-free people 50 years of age or older with an average risk colorectal cancer, the panel stressed. People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said.

The updated recommendation was published online June 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""Evidence convincingly shows screening for colorectal cancer works, but not enough people are taking advantage of this highly effective service,"" said Owens, a general internist at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System and a professor at Stanford University.

The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.

Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This year about 134,000 people in the country will be diagnosed with the disease, and about 49,000 will die from it., the panel said

The USPSTF is an independent, volunteer panel of experts that makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specific preventive health services.

story_reviews_00413,"(Reuters) - Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO) top-selling diabetes drug Victoza cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death by 13 percent in a closely watched study, but the result disappointed investors who had hoped for more.

The logo of Danish multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is pictured on the facade of a production plant in Chartres, north-central France, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Guillaume Souvant/Pool/File Photo

The stock fell around 5 percent in Copenhagen on Tuesday.

Victoza is only the second diabetes drug to show such heart benefits, after Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s pill Jardiance. Victoza’s effect was evident across risks.

“To me, the impressive thing about this trial is the consistency across clinical endpoints and its robustness,” said John Buse, professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine, who worked on the study.

He believes doctors’ approach to type 2 diabetes treatment will now start to shift to a greater focus on minimising overall risks, rather than simply cutting blood sugar levels.

Because about half of deaths in people with diabetes are caused by heart disease, reducing heart risk is considered essential to their care.

But investors had been anticipating a bigger effect. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications.

There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally.

Novo, the world’s biggest diabetes company, had said in March that Victoza cut heart risks “significantly” in the study but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed on Monday.

Researchers told the American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) annual meeting that 13.0 percent of patients on Victoza died from cardiovascular causes or suffered non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, against 14.9 percent of those on placebo.

Deaths from heart disease were 22 percent lower in the Victoza group.

The Jardiance trial last year showed a similar 14 percent overall relative risk reduction and a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular deaths.

The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test.

Victoza, which had sales of $2.7 billion last year, is the biggest seller in a class of drugs known as GLP-1 analogues that stimulate insulin production.

“I think physicians will look to GLP-1s with greater enthusiasm,” Buse said in an interview.

Once-daily Victoza is typically prescribed as a third or fourth option after patients have first tried various oral medicines.

“The significance of this is that now we can start to change the conversation around diabetes management from one of ‘let’s manage your blood sugar’ to one of ‘let’s manage your risk of complications’,” Buse said.

Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment.

The findings, which involved following 9,340 patients for a median 3.8 years, were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Gastrointestinal upset was the biggest side effect with Victoza. There were fewer cases of pancreatitis, which has been viewed as a potential problem, but more cases of pancreatic cancer, although the difference was not statistically significant.

Since 2008, U.S. regulators have demanded studies for new diabetes medicines to show there is no increase in heart risk, opening a new battleground between different treatments. Lilly is conducting a similar large study to try and prove the heart benefits of its once-weekly GLP-1 drug Trulicity.

story_reviews_00414,"Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Prudkov and Thinkstock.

It’s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids—the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers’ meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.

The only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.

Prozac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That’s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. “From a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,” he said.

There’s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children’s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory—something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.

And there’s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children’s Hospital, says, “It’s complicated, because you’re giving antidepressants when you’re very worried about that young person’s mood.” Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.

A comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. “Only if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,” he writes. “For antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.”

To be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. “They’re not better than nothing,” he said, “and there’s quite clear evidence that they’re more dangerous than nothing.” He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.

His wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don’t work well in children because they weren’t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.

The Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. Of course, having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help.

If there’s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it’s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway. Guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” which is has been shown to work, at least by participants’ own assessment of their depression levels (it’s very hard to test therapy against a placebo, for obvious reasons). Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents. Of course, this is a high-cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested, and it may not always be readily available—but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful.

Like in nearly all areas of science, biomedical or otherwise, our understanding is limited, and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options. Adolescent depression is particularly difficult, since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults. If we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients (critical, because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation), we need more data.",Prozac and antidepressants are less effective in children than previously thought.,2,Depression
story_reviews_00415,"A Scientist's Dream Fulfilled: Harnessing The Immune System To Fight Cancer

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Dalton for NPR Scott Dalton for NPR

Sharon Belvin's nightmare with cancer began in 2004, when she was just 22.

Belvin was an avid runner but said she suddenly found she couldn't climb the stairs without ""a lot of difficulty breathing.""

Eventually, after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments like bronchitis, she was diagnosed with melanoma — a very serious skin cancer. It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.

""Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,"" she says.

What Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)

Allison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.

""It's a new modality for treating cancer,"" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. ""It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer — surgery, radiation and chemotherapy — or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.""

Allison's long search for this new kind of treatment — one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients — began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

At the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system — T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can ""protect us against just about anything,"" Allison says.

T cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.

He and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do — shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.

Allison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.

""These mice were cured,"" Allison says.

Cancer cured?

""I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,"" Allison says. ""And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' ""

Allison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.

But the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.

""This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,"" he says. ""We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.""

Thanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.

""I got very depressed,"" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.

Eventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.

It took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug — now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short — was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Allison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.

As it happens, Belvin was also in New York — a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.

Belvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.

""Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,"" Wolchok told her.

Belvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: ""Sharon, you no longer have cancer.""

And in the next breath, Belvin recalls, ""he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' ""

""Yes, of course I want to meet him!"" she told her doctor.

Wolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic — a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.

Belvin says she tried not to tackle him. ""It was hard to control myself,"" she says. ""I owe this man my life.""

Belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. ""It really meant a lot,"" he says. ""It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.""

That was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.

Ippy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.

Meanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.

He's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.

Allison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.

It might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, ""but we're going to cure certain types of cancers. We've got a shot at it now.""",A Scientist's Dream Fulfilled: Harnessing The Immune System To Fight Cancer,3,Cancer

story_reviews_00417,"When it comes to health, I’m skeptical of willpower. Sure, I talk to my students about personal responsibility, but when it comes to the health of populations, I look for big fixes more than for small acts of will.

That’s why my ears perked up when I heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking, as a preventive measure, some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the “polypill.” My friends are both top doctors in their 60s, with good diet and lifestyle, and this is now part of their personal health regimen.

A polypill might include any of several things: a baby aspirin, a statin to rebalance cholesterol, a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar. (A version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctor’s prescription at Polypill.com.) Whatever the combination, the doses are low, so it’s relatively safe. It’s like a multivitamin, but with serious medications. Some public-health advocates now argue that everyone over 50 should be on one.

You read that right: everyone. If we had perfectly healthy lifestyles, these drugs would not be needed, but we don’t. And even if we did, the drugs might add further protection.

One review of the research on polypills comes from Melvin Lafeber and his colleagues at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Netherlands). Writing in Current Hypertension Reports in April, they found reason to think that treatment might help higher-risk individuals and urged more clinical trials. If moderate- and high-risk people benefit, “the idea of offering treatment to everybody older than 50 years might raise widespread interest,” they wrote. The polypill, they concluded, “could be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease” and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs.

Critics worry about medicalizing whole populations, predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities. A fixed-dose combination pill is one-size-fits-all, which doctors don’t usually regard as the best medicine. But polypills might solve real problems. The drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world, and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines.

Some of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lower-risk populations—that is, people who don’t already have serious problems with their blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol. Though not a polypill experiment per se, a study published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine involved 12,000 people over five years. One group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, the other got placebos. In the group taking both drugs, 3.6% died or had health crises; in the placebo group, 5% did. The doses were low, so the adverse effects were modest.

This doesn’t mean that we should all be on the polypill, but some sensible experts, including my two doctor friends, are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who aren’t ill or at high risk. After all, many of us are already taking low-dose aspirin, which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs.

I tend to favor this sort of blunt, comprehensive approach to public health. Much as I like menacing cigarette-package warnings, urging personal responsibility, I like cigarette taxes more (despite their regressive impact). I love “Drive Carefully” signs, but I like seat belts better. And I like air bags best: No judgment, no decision, no defiant will. As for driving under the influence, breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver.

Human nature is not our ally in maintaining health. With heart disease and stroke, many millions of lives are at stake, and for me it comes down to this: Will popping a polypill work better than willpower? I suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes.",A ‘Polypill’ May Be the Next Big Preventive Fix,1,Wall Street Journal
story_reviews_00418,"Jennifer Molson was 21, juggling a day job and night school to pursue her dream of becoming a cop, when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She woke up one morning with pins and needles in her hand, and within a week she couldn't move her left arm.

By 2001, five years later, she was living in the Ottawa Hospital under 24-hour care, getting around using a cane, walker, or wheelchair. When she was discharged on weekends, to spend time with her then-boyfriend Aaron, she had to rely on him for her every need. He'd cut her food into bite-size pieces, and bathe and dress her. When she lost control of her bladder or bowel, he'd help her go to the bathroom.

""I had no feeling from the chest down,"" Molson says. ""I could touch something boiling on the stove and burn myself. I could touch fabric without knowing whether it's sandpaper."" For patients like Molson, with a severe form of MS and no response to the available medications, there’s little hope.

Two years later, her life had taken an abrupt turn. ""I walked down the aisle and danced at my wedding, something I had always dreamed of doing,"" she said of her marriage to Aaron in 2003.

Now, 15 years later, Molson is still skiing and kayaking on the weekends. She works as a research assistant at Ottawa Hospital.

What happened is something even esteemed medical specialists are venturing to call a ""miracle"": The particularly aggressive MS that was on track to disable Molson entirely — and potentially kill her — is now virtually eliminated from her body.

The game changer for Molson was an experimental chemotherapy and stem cell bone marrow transplant she got in 2002 as part of a study in Canada. Molson was one of a small cohort of 24 people with MS who received the high-risk therapy. Of the 24 patients, 70 percent saw the progression of their disease halted or reversed.

Their experience, documented in a paper published today in the Lancet, is the first to describe any MS treatment that fully stops the disease over the long term without MS medication.

""Everyone is hesitating to use the 'c word,' but these patients are cured,"" says Michael Rudnicki, director of the Regenerative Medicine Program and the Sprott Centre for Stem Cell Research at the Ottawa Health Research Institute, who was not involved with the research. ""Jennifer Molson was in a wheelchair in a rehab center unable to work. And now she's skiing, she's working, she got married, got her driver's license. I think this is going to be the new standard of care for progressive MS.""

""My greatest hope was that the disease would stabilize""

MS affects about 2.5 million people around the world, particularly women in more temperate climates like Canada and the northern US.

Instead of protecting the body from foreign invaders, in patients with MS the immune system turns on its host, wreaking particular damage on the myelin, a protective coating around the nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord.

Eventually these attacks can severely damage and destroy the nerves and myelin, interrupting the communication between the brain and body and leading to symptoms like numbness, trouble walking, and even blindness.

But not all patients' symptoms manifest in the same way. People with ""relapsing remitting"" disease experience MS in fits and starts — their symptoms show up for a few days or weeks, followed by weeks, months, or even years of remission.

For most patients with this version of the disease, those periods of remission get smaller over time and eventually disappear, moving them into a new phase of disease known as ""secondary progressive MS.""

Other patients experience something even more insidious and grinding. It's called ""primary progressive MS,"" and instead of bouts of remission they see a continuous increase in symptoms accompanied by a decline in health.

Molson had secondary progressive MS at the time of her treatment in 2002. She had tried medication, and nothing worked.

Her doctor, Mark Freedman (one of the authors on the Lancet paper), told her the stem cell transplant wasn't going to cure her, but at best, if the procedure went well, her health wouldn't worsen.

""My greatest hope was that the disease would stabilize,"" Molson says. ""I looked at Aaron, [now] my husband, and said, 'If I don't do this, and it proves to work, I'd be kicking myself if my disease progressed.' It felt like I really didn't have a choice.""

How stem cells gave Molson a new immune system

Once she was accepted into the study, doctors began the procedure. They first put her through a short course of chemotherapy to stimulate the production of hematopoietic stem cells, which regenerate the immune system, in her blood. They then hooked her up to a machine that cycled through her blood 32 times over the course of seven hours, in order to collect stem cells. Those stem cells were then purified, wiped of any memory of the disease, to later be transplanted into Molson through a blood transfusion.

The most trying part of the treatment: Molson had to endure 10 days of chemotherapy. The doctors were essentially killing off her diseased immune system, only to later replace it with a new one in the form of her own purified stem cells. But the experience was grueling. Molson likened it to ""hell.""

""I had a feeding tube because I was constantly nauseous,"" she says. ""I couldn't keep my food down.""

Growing a new, disease-free immune system meant Molson's body had to relearn how to defend itself from disease-causing bacteria and viruses. She had to get her childhood vaccines again. But she was also more vulnerable to infection, and wound up developing a blood infection, shingles, and serious bladder infections shortly after the transplant.

""It took me at least a year before I started to feel human again,"" Molson says.

Around a year and half after the transplant, she began to slowly return to some likeness of her pre-MS self: She was walking without using a cane, she could shop in the grocery store again, and eventually she didn't need to nap every afternoon.

""I thought, Maybe I can go back to work,"" she says. By 2006, four years after her treatment, she returned to work full time. (She chose to work at the Ottawa Hospital, she said, after seeing firsthand how research can change people's lives.)

Molson, now 41, says, ""I haven't had any MS symptoms in 14 years. And I'm not on any MS medications."" That's a big deal given that the medications usually involve daily pills or frequent injections.

But treatment has also left her several unpleasant side effects. Because the chemotherapy damaged her ovaries and put her into early menopause, she's on hormone replacement therapy — and wouldn't be able to get pregnant. While she was given the chance to harvest her eggs, she declined. ""I couldn't look after myself, how could I raise children?,"" she says. ""Remember, I wasn't supposed to get better.""

She also has to be extra cautious about any exposure to infections. ""I was at the dentist three weeks ago, and I had to be on antibiotics before I went for a teeth cleaning,"" she says. ""There are still parts of the immune system that you have to be careful about.""

Molson's hair never fully grew back, and she also contends with daily heartburn and digestive issues, which she takes medications for.

Otherwise, Molson says she feels as good as she did when she was 21, before her diagnosis. ""I don't take anything for granted. I got a second chance at life.""

Only 5 percent of MS patients will be eligible for this new treatment

The study that gave Molson this chance was impressive in its scope and its execution — conducted at multiple hospitals by hematologists and neurologists in Canada and lasting nearly 20 years, from conception to publication. It built on decades of basic research about MS, stem cells, and the immune system, including years of experience using the treatment in patients with blood and bone marrow cancers like leukemia and lymphoma.

Other scientists have already seen promising results in MS patients using similar treatment protocols, but none have managed what Atkins's team has: to completely halt the disease's attack on the brain —no relapses, no new MRI lesions in all surviving patients — and for such a long follow-up period.

Several researchers who were not involved with the experiment — and who typically are reserved about novel treatments — told Vox they were excited and hopeful for the treatment's potential to benefit others with the disease.

""I think this is going to be the new standard of care for progressive MS,"" said Rudnicki.

""It’s exciting — an important proof of principle,"" said Jeffrey Gelfand, a neurologist specializing in MS at the University of California San Francisco.

Tim Caulfield, a University of Alberta professor who has been tracking stem cell research, noted the difference between this robust finding and the unfounded claims in stem cell clinics around the world: ""This is a fascinating development … [and] a good example of the difference between the real clinical research and what is being marketed by the clinics providing unproven therapies — you can't simply ‘inject’ stem cells and expect significant results.""

Still, there are major caveats to consider. This study was small and lacked a comparison or control arm. Similar, larger studies are needed to confirm the results, and it's not clear what will happen to patients like Molson in the much longer term.

Ottawa Hospital hematologist Harry Atkins, the researcher who led the study, pointed out that only about 5 percent of MS patients would be eligible for this treatment: again, the minority who have an aggressive form of MS that's not responding to any treatment.

And not everyone in the study had results like Molson's. Of the 24 patients, 70 percent saw the progression of their disease halt or reverse, but the other 30 percent continued to worsen.

That minority who didn’t respond, the researchers think, had MS that was already too far along by the time of their treatment. ""At early stages, once the immune system quiets down, the brain can partially heal itself, so the disability tends to get better,"" Atkins explained. ""But as time goes on, the brain can't repair itself.""

One patient died, which puts the potential for death from this procedure at around 4 percent, and severe infections after stem cell treatments — the kind Molson picked up, or worse — are also common.

Since there are other MS medications that are much less toxic and can help some patients, doctors only recommend considering this therapy as a last resort. (Theoretically, the treatment could be done in most blood and marrow transplant centers associated with major hospitals, Atkins said, but there are only a few that perform the procedure. Interested patients can contact the MS Society for more information.)

There's also the cost: Atkins put it at about $50,000 to $65,000 per patient — and that's if nothing goes wrong. (Although, MS medications now cost about as much for patients every year in the US so this therapy could actually be a money saver.)

And there are questions about the very long-term effects. It’s not clear what the next 10, 20, or 50 years look like for patients like Molson.

""We know in the long term survivors from groups that have their transplants for cancer and they're cured and they live a long time,"" Atkins said, ""that they have a higher incidence of the general population of other diseases [such as heart disease and cancers].""

Already, Atkins and his team have been working on other applications for this stem cell procedure. They managed to reverse ""stiff-person syndrome"" — a rare neurological disease that causes the muscles in the body contract to the point of complete immobilization — in one patient. And there’s talk of applying the treatment to myasthenia gravis, another incurable autoimmune disease.

Cures in medicine are extremely rare. It's still too early to label this treatment a cure for MS. ""We have only followed our patients for up to 13 years,"" Atkins said, ""so it’s hard to say what the next 10 to 20 will bring. You’d want to know that before you'd call this a cure.""

For now, though, Atkins will use the word miracle. ""It still appears like a miracle to me to see patients recover, and get back to the things that they were supposed to do in life,"" he said. ""It is very rewarding to see and it wasn't what we expected, and we are overjoyed about it to know this treatment can help people in that way.""

story_reviews_00419,"Older women being treated for the most common form of breast cancer who took drugs called aromatase inhibitors for 10 years rather than the usual five had a lower risk of their cancer returning, particularly in the opposite breast, physicians reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

In a randomized controlled trial, 959 women were given the drug and 959 a placebo. Thirteen of the women taking the drug for an additional five years developed breast cancer in the opposite breast during the study, compared with 31 taking the placebo; 55 and 68, respectively, developed a recurrence of cancer in the original breast.

For any individual woman, the odds of developing “contralateral” breast cancer — that is, in the opposite breast — are still lower than 200-to-1 per year.

advertisement

Still, said Dr. Richard Schilsky, who serves as the chief medical officer of ASCO and who was not involved in the study, “there’s a substantial benefit” to continuing aromatase inhibitors out to 10 years to lower the chance of cancer developing in the other breast.

The study did not continue long enough to discover whether the lower risk of developing cancer in the opposite breast translated into a lower risk of death.

The study, which was also published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, was partially funded by Novartis (NVS), which sells letrozole — the aromatase inhibitor used in the trial — as the branded drug Femara. Several of the authors have received speaking fees or consulting payments from Novartis, AstraZeneca (AZN) (which makes letrozole), and Pfizer (PFE) (maker of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane).

Letrozole is available as a generic for less than $100 a month.

The trial included 1,918 postmenopausal women who had what’s called hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, in which the hormones estrogen or progesterone fuel the proliferation of cells. About two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, and they have a good prognosis. Aromatase inhibitors block an enzyme that the body needs to produce estrogen.

The women had taken another breast cancer drug, tamoxifen, for several years and then were started on an aromatase inhibitor, which doctors usually prescribe for five years.

After following the women for a median of just over six years, found Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital and his colleagues, 95 percent of those taking letrozole for the additional five years remained free of breast cancer (meaning the disease had not returned in the original breast or developed in the opposite one). Of those taking an inert pill, or placebo, 91 percent did.

Put another way, the risk of cancer returning in the original or the opposite breast was 34 percent lower in women on 10 years of letrozole compared with those who stopped after five. There was no difference in survival, however: 100 women in each group died during the study.

“The reason this is a milestone trial is that it’s the first to show that 10 years [on letrozole] is better than five,” said Dr. Nicholas Robert, an oncologist with Virginia Cancer Specialists and a co-author of the study. But because the absolute benefits were not huge, and because the drug did cause side effects, it makes sense to consider this for women at the highest risk of a recurrence of breast cancer, he said.

Aromatase inhibitors cause side effects in some women, especially night sweats, hot flashes, and sexual dysfunction. Women receiving five more years of letrozole also had greater loss of bone in their hip, worse osteoporosis, and more fractures.

Experts said the study was significant because some women and their doctors choose to continue aromatase inhibitors past the standard five years. There had been no research on whether that was beneficial.

Dr. Debra Patt, a breast cancer specialist at Texas Oncology who was not involved in the study, called the difference of a few percentage points in the risk of recurrence (95 percent vs. 91 percent) “substantial. If you can tolerate the side effects, I think many women will opt to take the extra years of letrozole, so this study is practice-changing.”

Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society cautioned, however, that “one has to be cautious in interpreting these results,” partly because “based on what they show, there is no overall change in survival.”",Breast cancer study may influence use of aromatase inhibitors,5,STAT
story_reviews_00420,"Patients will potentially be able to avoid medications that do not help them and the test could start a ‘new era’ for personalised treatment of depression

Scientists have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them.

The experts involved believe the breakthrough could lead to depressed patients receiving personalised treatments that are more likely to relieve their symptoms.

The Royal College of Psychiatrists said that, if it worked, the test could prove to be a key moment in the quest for the holy grail of biological psychiatry.

The scientists at King’s College London behind the development claim that their test “accurately and reliably predicts whether depressed patients will respond to common antidepressants, which could herald a new era of personalised treatment for people with depression”.

If the test proves effective it is hoped that by measuring patients’ level of blood inflammation it would identify which of them would benefit from receiving antidepressants soon after their diagnosis to stop their condition worsening.

What does depression feel like? Trust me – you really don’t want to know | Tim Lott Read more

About half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people.

Currently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants, or combinations of them. That means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them.

One in six Britons will suffer depression at some point in their life. Last year 61.5m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England.

Researchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood, as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants. They found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants. Their findings have been reported in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.

“The identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients,” said Prof Carmine Pariante from KCL’s institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience.

“This study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy. Patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, including the addition of other antidepressants or anti-inflammatory drugs,” Pariante added.

Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Finding biological markers for depression (and other mental illnesses) has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry.

“Such a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression. It would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient.”

But further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting, Hallstrom added.

Stephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind, said: “We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done.”

story_reviews_00421,"About 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year. Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they’re only effective within the first few hours of an event.

Recently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.

“What surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,” Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, “While we had hoped for that, we didn’t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there’s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there’s not much more [more] they can recover usually.”

For the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.

Results showed that the implanted stem cells didn’t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.

“The recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,” said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. “It wasn’t just someone who couldn’t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].""

The types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.

In Steinberg's study, it did not “cause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.” And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.

Motor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients’ conditions— an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.

In addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change “our notion of what happens after a stroke,” Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be “resurrected.”

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, June 1, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- If you find yourself hospitalized, you've got a one in five chance of needing a urinary catheter -- raising your risk for a urinary tract infection.

Now, researchers report that a new program shows it might be possible to reduce both catheter use and its associated infections.

""Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are common and costly patient safety problems,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjay Saint. He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

Roughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out.

Although about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren't needed, Saint said. He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use.

""A lot of patients and families don't realize that there are problems with a urinary catheter, so they may request them because they think it will allow patients to stay in bed,"" Saint said.

""Unfortunately, there are side effects with a catheter. And I've seen patients who have gotten up in the middle of the night and they trip and fall on the tubing,"" he explained.

""Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed,"" Saint suggested.

For the study, Saint and his colleagues tried the new program in 600 hospitals.

After 18 months of using the program, infection rates among hospital patients in general wards dropped by one-third, while catheter use had dropped about 1 percent.

But there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed.

Hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted.

The program Saint helped develop -- called the ""bladder bundle"" -- includes protocols, checklists, training and information-sharing that help doctors and nurses reduce catheter use and prevent infections.

Included in the program are:

Daily checks to see if a catheter is still needed.

Using other options to collect urine, such as bedpans.

Training for managing urinary catheters.

Use of infection-control techniques for catheter placement and maintenance.

Feedback to the medical team about catheter use and infection rates.

The researchers found that catheter infection rates in the new program dropped 14 percent overall in general wards (non-ICU).

The findings were published June 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dr. Susan Huang, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, Irvine, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. She said, ""While we've known the correct care processes for managing urinary catheters, we haven't been able to reliably reduce catheter-related infections.""

An intervention that focuses on changing the culture in hospitals to make them more responsive to the problem of infection control -- one that involves ""rallying around a focused problem and ensuring team-based solutions -- is integral to improving infection control in hospitals,"" she said.

As for improving infection control in intensive care units, Huang said, ""further analysis may help us understand why this intervention didn't work.""

""This program can reduce urinary infections in hospitals if a team is assembled to ensure adoption of best practices and to rapidly correct reasons for failing to comply with these processes,"" she added.

story_reviews_00423,"(Reuters) - Dermira Inc said its experimental topical therapy for excessive underarm sweating was successful in two late-stage studies, bringing it one step closer to providing an easy-to-use therapy for the often embarrassing condition.

While the function of sweating is to prevent overheating, those affected sweat even when the body does not need cooling.

Existing therapies for excessive underarm sweating, also called axillary hyperhidrosis, offer limited effectiveness and can be expensive.

The first line of defense are anti-perspirants. Next, patients can try costlier alternatives such as botox injections, a device called miraDry that delivers electromagnetic energy to decompose sweat glands, or laser therapy to destroy them.

Sufferers can also opt for localized surgery, like liposuction, to remove or injure sweat glands. Oral medicines can be used to systemically limit sweating. For instance, a class of drugs called anticholinergics are commonly used off-label for this purpose, but they are linked with the risk of dementia.

Based on the most recent estimates, about 7.8 million Americans have some form of excessive sweating including palms, feet, underarms or head, and about half of this population suffer from the underarm form, said Dermira spokeswoman Erica Jefferson, in an interview ahead of the data readout.

The Menlo Park, California-based company’s shares were up 3 percent at $33.00 in extended trading on Wednesday.

About two-thirds of the total 697 enrolled in the two trials for the company’s topical treatment, DRM04, were treated with wipes containing DRM04, while the rest were not.

In the first trial, a significant improvement in the severity of sweating was seen in 52.8 percent of the patients treated with the drug, compared with 28.3 percent patients in the control group, on a scale designed by the company.

In the second trial, a significant improvement was seen in 66.1 percent of the drug-treated patients, compared with 26.9 percent in the control group.

Dermira said it had expected to apply for marketing approval for the drug in the second half of 2017, subject to completion of the drug’s long-term safety trial.",Dermira's drug for excessive armpit sweating succeeds in key studies,2,Reuters

A new generation of treatments for severe eczema is on the horizon, which doctors say could help millions more patients gain relief from chronic outbreaks of the oozing, itchy and sometimes debilitating rashes that come with the disease.

At least two new eczema medicines could be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017, and a half-dozen more drugs are being tested in clinical trials.

An ointment made by Anacor Pharmaceuticals and an injected drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi are designed to block specific proteins that cause inflammation. By targeting particular drivers of the disease, it’s believed the drugs cause fewer side effects than the steroid creams and pills that are the mainstay of treatment today.

Steroids are blunt instruments that broadly suppress the body’s immune and inflammatory responses, doctors say. They carry the risk of long-term side effects, including thinning or weakening the skin, kidney damage and osteoporosis.

The Facts on Eczema Affects an estimated 7% to 10% of U.S. adults.

Symptoms include dry and itchy patches of skin.

“The treatments we have now are either not safe or not effective,” says Emma Guttman-Yassky, professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “The new drugs are more specific and therefore safer and potentially more effective.”

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, affects roughly 12% of U.S. children and 7% to 10% of adults, according to some estimates. It is most common in children and often goes away on its own before adolescence. However, many adults also suffer from the disease, including an estimated 1.6 million with severe types that can have negative effects on their emotional and mental health, leading to bouts of depression or thoughts of suicide.

The exact causes of eczema aren’t fully understood, but most scientists agree that a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors cause the body’s inflammation response to overreact.

It’s long been thought the immune system plays a role in the disease, but only in the past five to 10 years has evidence emerged about the specific molecules that are most active.

ENLARGE Kelly Hayes of Chicago says she has benefited from the new drug dupilumab after years of suffering with eczema. Photo: Alexandar Arsenijevic

“For a long time we didn’t have good [molecular] targets in atopic dermatitis, but we do now,” says Sarina B. Elmariah, a dermatologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. “I think you’re going to see a revolution over the next 10 years in the number of treatments available.”

Regeneron’s drug, dupilumab, targets two such molecules and in late-stage studies helped clear or nearly clear serious rashes in up to 38% of patients, or four times as many as patients taking placebo.

The FDA has designated dupilumab a “breakthrough therapy,” which is designed to help speed along promising new drugs to market. Regeneron and its partner, Sanofi, plan to submit dupilumab for FDA approval in the third quarter this year, which means it could be on the market as soon as 2017.

AstraZeneca, AZN -0.23 % Eli Lilly and Roche Holding are some of the other drugmakers studying targeted eczema treatments in clinical studies.

Kelly Hayes, a 26-year-old project coordinator at a Chicago software company, has benefited from dupilumab. She has suffered for most of her life from eczema outbreaks that would nearly cover her body in rashes, open lesions and deep cuts. She spent hours each day caring for her skin, including nightly baths with salt, oatmeal and even small amounts of bleach to prevent staph infections.

ENLARGE Ms. Hayes’s cleared-up hand after dupilumab treatment. Photo: Alexandar Arsenijevic

Ms. Hayes says she often felt shunned by peers growing up because of her appearance. Some schoolmates feared her rashes were contagious and would refuse to have direct contact, she says. For a time, eczema “destroyed my self-esteem,” she says.

Last year, Ms. Hayes entered a clinical study of Regeneron’s dupilumab. Within six months, her disease had gone from severe to moderate. Her skin became less red, she itched less and she had fewer rashes. Now, after a year and a half, her skin is almost entirely clear of the disease, Ms. Hayes says.

“Emotionally, I feel awesome,” Ms. Hayes says. “It’s a big boost in confidence knowing that people aren’t going to freak out when they see you.”

Anacor’s drug, called crisaborole, is an ointment aimed at treating children and adults with milder eczema. The drug works by blocking an enzyme known as PDE-4, which has long been known to cause inflammation. However, the only drugs that block the enzyme are pills that carry side effects including nausea and diarrhea and are considered too harsh for patients with mild disease.

Anacor developed a treatment that can be applied directly to the skin and, because it doesn’t circulate throughout the body, avoids causing those serious side effects. It uses the element boron, which allows topical skin medications to better penetrate the skin and hit specific molecular targets like PDE-4, the company says.

In late-stage studies, roughly half of patients taking crisaborole had their diseases cleared or nearly cleared, a statistically significant improvement compared with 30% to 41% of patients using moisturizing placebos. The most common side effect was pain where the ointment was applied, experienced by about 4.4% of crisaborole patients and 1.2% of control-group patients.

The FDA is scheduled to decide whether to approve the drug by January. If approved, crisaborole would be the first new nonsteroidal treatment for eczema in more than a decade. Many doctors say they expect the drug to benefit patients whose diseases go undertreated because their fears about steroids cause them to use the drugs less frequently than prescribed.

“We need a lot more nonsteroidal options, and [crisaborole] looks like it may be an important addition to our armamentarium,” says Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “We have limited options for the thing we can safely give patients without worries about their long term use.”

story_reviews_00425,"Scientists have raised the possibility of using statins – drugs used for reducing cholesterol – to stop some breast cancer tumours returning.

The most common form of breast cancer uses oestrogen to grow. Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year.

Study points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer Read more

Early research – most of it still in the lab – published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow.

Dr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: “During the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are ‘fed’ by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it.

“This is hugely significant. Testing the patient’s tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.”

The research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells’ growth by between 30% and 50%.

The scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs.

Cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings.

Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: “This is a really crucial discovery. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments.

“This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. But this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach.”

Another charity, Breast Cancer Care, said the research was promising but needed further trials. “This early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol-reducing treatment, such as statins, could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy,” said Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist.

“We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment. This discovery may, in future, help reduce these concerns for some patients, by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return, and tailor treatment accordingly.”",Statins 'could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment',2,The Guardian
story_reviews_00426,"Jack Crowley was 15 when a baseball hit him in the chest and stopped his heart. The Long Island teen survived, thanks to a police officer who grabbed a defibrillator and shocked his heart back into rhythm.

A blow to the chest — one that hits at just the wrong spot, at just the wrong time — can trigger deadly cardiac arrest. Fortunately it's rare. But most victims are otherwise healthy kid athletes. And survival hinges on fast use of those heart-zapping defibrillators that not every athletic league or school keeps near the playing fields.

There soon may be another attempt at protection: A U.S. organization that oversees athletic equipment has proposed the first performance standard for chest protectors to reduce the risk from those blows, a step that could lead to updated gear.

Nancy Crowley finds it hard to watch her three sports-loving sons' games since Jack's scary near-miss in a batting cage a year ago. She calls the latest move by the athletic industry overdue.

""You cannot live in a bubble,"" acknowledged Crowley, who helped lobby local athletic officials to improve access to defibrillators but wants more protection. ""If a standard has come along that they feel is going to protect them in some way, I'm thrilled.""

Cardiac arrest, when the heart abruptly stops beating, is uncommon in young people, especially athletes who presumably are in their prime. There are no good counts in kids' athletics. Whatever the number — or whatever the cause — cardiac arrest is getting more attention from parents, coaches and heart specialists who say deaths should be preventable.

Indeed, NCAA guidelines recently reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology say defibrillators should be kept in the immediate vicinity of ""high risk locations"" such as weight rooms, basketball courts and ball fields.

For younger students, many states have laws encouraging or requiring defibrillators in schools but few specify athletic facilities, according to the advocacy group Parent Heart Watch.

The most frequent cause of cardiac arrest in a young athlete is an underlying structural problem of the heart, such as a thickened heart muscle, the problem often behind headline-making collapses of basketball players.

The chest protector standards take aim at a different problem: Every year, an estimated 10 to 20 people suffer what's called commotio cordis — cardiac arrest caused by a blow to the chest. A voluntary registry that has collected information on more than 250 cases over two decades does show survival increasing in recent years thanks to more defibrillator access.

The highest risk is to boys under 15, when the chest wall is still flexible, not as sturdy as it will become by their 20s when such deaths hardly ever are reported.

About a third of the time, victims were wearing some form of chest protector when they collapsed, showing at least some of today's equipment isn't enough, said Dr. Mark Link, a heart specialist at Tufts University Medical Center who spent more than a decade unraveling just how commotio cordis occurs.

Link's tests, using young pigs as a model, revealed that killer hits are those landing directly over the heart, at about 40 miles an hour — and in the milliseconds between heartbeats.

Armed with that science, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, or NOCSAE, funded creation of a sort of crash-test dummy to prove what gear really reduces the risk, and proposed the first standard for chest protectors used in baseball and lacrosse that aim to do so.

The idea: find materials that disperse the heart-damaging force of a blow without impeding players' movements — whether they're catchers or youngsters playing other positions who may wear shirt-like chest coverings under their uniforms. Guarding against commotio cordis may require a different design than standard foam that blocks a broken rib. Among the questions is how to integrate protection against both.

The standard is expected to be completed in January; only then could manufacturers label gear certified as meeting it. NOCSAE's recommendations often are adopted by sports governing bodies. It's not clear what such gear would cost.

Already, one company that uses military-grade materials in sports equipment has developed some lightweight protection it expects to fit the bill. In March, Link's team published lab tests in the Journal of Clinical Sports Medicine suggesting a combination of foams and polymers used by Pennsylvania-based Unequal Technologies is likely to be effective. The company, which funded the research, is producing chest protectors and heart-covering shirts that it plans to test against the final NOCSAE standard.

""If we can stop a bullet, we can stop a ball,"" said Unequal chief executive Rob Vito.

Other manufacturers are traveling to NOCSAE's lab to learn to test products. Stan Jurga Jr. of All-Star Sporting Goods, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer, wonders if he'll need to alter equipment aimed at professionals, too, because teens sometimes wear the adult sizes.

""Those are the real-world challenges,"" said Jurga, who also is pursuing a protective shirt. But he applauded the science, saying, ""the last thing anyone wants is a false sense of security.""",Chest Protectors Guard Against Deadly Blows to Chest,3,Associated Press
story_reviews_00427,"For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task. Specialists now have a way to test the parents-to-be that may not only increase their chances of getting pregnant but also reduce the risk of them passing on certain genetic diseases.

“When we do pre-implantation genetic screening, we can ensure that the embryos are chromosomally normal before transferring them back to the intended mother’s uterus, and that increases the likelihood of implantation,” Dr. Jared Robbins, an associated professor in obstetrics and gynecology-reproductive endo & infertility at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), birth defects caused by genetic disorders affect one in every 33 births in the United States.

The test results may limit the chances of an embryo carrying a chromosomal disorder from being implanted.

“We can’t fix the embryos yet, but we can determine which embryos are affected by the disease and which aren’t and only transfer back those that are not affected,” Robbins, who is also a fertility doctor at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said.

A diagnosis before pregnancy may sound like a designer baby, but doctors say that’s not the case.

“We have the technology and ability to eradicate diseases that have ravaged families for decades,” Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, told Fox News. “They’ve lost family members generation after generation after generation, or they’ve had family members who’ve suffered from chronic disease that’s totally preventable.”

These procedures not only help limit the passing on of diseases— they may also help couples get pregnant faster.

“We’re getting significantly higher pregnancy rates, significantly lower miscarriage rates,” Silverberg said.

These results have helped eliminate pre-term birth and hospitalizations for pre-term labor, and patients and families have better outcomes, he added.

Pre-implantation genetic screening doesn’t necessarily get patients pregnant unless they have good embryos, Robbins noted.

“All it does is allow us to choose the best embryos to transfer so that we can get the patients pregnant faster,” he said.

Experts say the couples are not the only people who benefit from these tests. The results may help family members who are trying to get pregnant make decisions as well.",Embryo screening helps couples avoid genetic diseases,2,Fox News
story_reviews_00428,"The Ache: In the digital age, many people spend hours daily bent over computers, phones and tablets—our necks craned forward. Some scientists say this unnatural position can lead to pain, headaches and other symptoms, sometimes collectively called “text neck.”

The Claim: Technology itself comes to the rescue. An Android app called the Text Neck Indicator measures the angle of your phone and lets you know when you’re holding it in a favorable viewing position. And a new wearable device, Alex, monitors the angle of your neck and vibrates when your posture is poor.

The Verdict: Neither product has been tested in a human study. Some scientists say the technological nannies are a good idea. Others caution that neck pain and headaches have complex causes, and—to the surprise of some researchers—a recent study found that better posture doesn’t necessarily prevent pain.

The Text Neck Indicator, invented by Plantation, Fla., chiropractor Dean L. Fishman, shows a green light when your phone is tilted toward you at an “acceptable” viewing angle, defined by the app as at least 65 degrees from the horizontal, says Dr. Fishman. The goal is to encourage people to use their phones with their head in neutral position, with the ears over the shoulders, rather than craned forward, he says. Dr. Fishman has trademarked the term Text Neck.

Namu’s Alex vibrates when the neck is tilted too far forward. Photo: Namu

Alex, a small device worn behind the neck from Namu Inc. of Seoul, vibrates when the neck is tilted too far forward. Using an iPhone or Android app, the user calibrates the device by touching the screen when in good posture and poor posture. Alex was launched on Kickstarter and sells on Indiegogo for $99.

If you already have pain, “there may be a benefit if you use something like this in conjunction with an exercise program that strengthens neck muscles and muscles stabilizing the head,” says Alan S. Hilibrand, professor of spinal surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.

In 2014, a study in the journal Surgical Technology International used a computer model to calculate that the force to the cervical spine—the seven vertebrae in the neck region—increased from 10 or 12 pounds with the head in a neutral position to 27 pounds at a 15-degree forward tilt and 49 pounds at 45 degrees.

The extra force results in more load on discs, which can eventually degenerate and lead to chronic neck pain, says study co-author Kenneth K. Hansraj, a cervical surgeon in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Technological reminders, such as Alex and the Text Neck Indicator, can help “raise awareness” about good posture, adds Dr. Hansraj, who has no link to Dr. Fishman or Namu.

The Text Neck Indicator app. Photo: Dean Fishman

Some scientists say that, for reasons not yet fully understood, poor posture doesn’t appear to be as linked to neck pain as common sense would suggest. A study of 1,108 adolescents published earlier in May in the journal of the American Physical Therapy Association found no link between posture, including neck tilted forward, and either pain or headaches.

“Can you say to the whole population: If you improve your posture you reduce your risk of neck pain? We haven’t the evidence to say that,” says study co-author Leon M. Straker. a professor of physiotherapy at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. Still, devices such as Alex could be helpful for certain people who have noticed that their pain increases with prolonged periods in poor posture, he adds.

In testing Alex, I liked that I could adjust the neck tilt the device considered “bad,” which allowed me to set reasonable goals. I also liked that the device allowed me to choose how long it gave me before vibrating to warn of poor posture. I chose to have it vibrate after my neck had been craned forward for a minute.

In a brief test of the Text Neck Indicator, on a friend’s Android phone, I found that tilting the device until the light turned green improved my posture from my habitual neck crane to a smaller bend forward. To achieve a neutral position, I needed to not only tilt the phone as prompted by the app, but also move it high in front of my face.

That illustrates the trade-off between improving your neck angle and potentially causing your shoulders and arms to hurt, says Jack Dennerlein, director of the occupational biomechanics and ergonomics laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston. To reduce stress on muscles when raising the phone, hold your arms closer to your body, says Dr. Fishman, adding that holding the phone at a proper angle and height gets easier with improved strength and muscle memory.

Craning your neck occasionally isn’t a bad thing, but it is best for the body to move and change positions often, says Eric K. Robertson, director of graduate physical therapy education for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California and a spokesman for the American Physical Therapy Association. When you’re working on a computer or using a device, try to take a break every 15 or 20 minutes and stretch or change position, he says.

And for one patient, it is promising.

On April 9, 2013, James Mason was an accident waiting to happen.

""There was nothing we could have done to change that night,"" said Bob Gambuti.

During an argument, James Mason's stepfather Bob Gambuti, tried to stop him from getting into a car after Mason had been drinking.

""He grabbed onto me, I grabbed onto him,"" said Gambuti. ""He pulled my leg out and we fell back and his neck broke.""

""I remember just hitting the ground,"" said Mason. ""I remember the whole way with the stretcher.""

Gambuti said the most devastating part of the whole process was the first day that they lifted Mason out of a bed.

""And nothing moved,"" Gambuti said. ""Just his head. That really hit hard. At that point I really wanted to go jump off a bridge.""

Mason was left a quadriplegic, with just the slightest ability to move his arms. Doctors said he would never walk again.

Gambuti, a retired cop, became his full time caregiver and found an experimental trial at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.

CBS News spoke with Mason just before he underwent delicate neck surgery to try and repair the demaged part of his spinal cord by injecting stem cells.

""I'm just super excited, ready to just get it done and go back to rehab and start proving the doctors wrong even more,"" said Mason.

The surgery performed by Dr. Arthur Jenkins, took four hours. Researchers have followed Mason and five other patients -- all with the most severe spinal cord injuries.

CBS News met up with Mason again three months after the surgery.

Mason said he was already noticing changes.

""My wrist has gotten a lot stronger. I'm able to grasp around a lot other things,"" he said.

And after six months, he was noticing changes then, too.

""I think it's almost doubled with how much I've gotten better,"" he said. ""And got sensation back into my feet. I can feel pressure onto 'em, throughout my legs. And they've noticed that I have a little bit of movement into my hips now.""

Today, the company sponsoring the trial reported four of the six patients experienced improvement in both motor strength and function. Dr. Jenkins, who is not affiliated with the company, has continued to monitor Mason.

""My two cents is it worked, that this actually changed his neurological recovery and function,"" Dr. Jenkins said. ""That his actual functional improvement is from the stem cells that were injected.""

What's that like for Mason?

""I mean, I just have to keep pushing forward,"" he said.

Mason does not blame his stepfather for the accident, in fact, he is grateful.

""If I had gotten into my car, I could have killed someone else, someone's mother, someone's father, someone's child. If I would have survived through that, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself,"" he said.

""It's odd and it's tough and people say, 'I'm sorry.' Don't be sorry. I still have him here,"" Gambuti said.

story_reviews_00432,"Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult and Aberdeen University are working on lab-grown treatment that could help hundreds of thousands of people

Insulin shots could become a thing of the past for type 1 diabetes patients thanks to a technology being developed by Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, a London-based not-for-profit organisation, and Aberdeen University.

The pre-clinical results have encouraged CGT and Aberdeen University to create a spin-out company, called Islexa. It will manufacture lab-grown islets, the organoids responsible for insulin production, by reprogramming donated pancreatic tissue.

Only 30-50 people with type 1 diabetes in the UK currently receive an islet transplant each year, owing to a lack of donors and the difficulty of extracting islets from pancreatic tissue.

Growing islets will “significantly increase the number of patients who can receive the treatment,” Keith Thompson, CGT’s chief executive, told the World Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine congress in London on Wednesday. He will run Islexa with Michael Bennet from CGT and Anne Lewendon from Aberdeen University.



If clinical trials are successful, the technology means tens of thousands more people could live without the need for frequent insulin injections, although it will take a few years until the treatment is available.

About 320,000 people in Britain have type 1 diabetes, a number set to more than double to 652,000 by 2035. Around the world, 21 million people have type 1 diabetes.

It is a lifelong condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, while type 2 diabetes – far more common, especially as obesity rises around the world – is a condition where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body’s cells do not react to it.

Prof Kevin Docherty, from Aberdeen University, said: “Donated islets are already effectively treating severe cases of type 1 diabetes. Having a hugely expanded supply of lab-grown islets will enable us to significantly extend this established clinical treatment.”

CGT was set up in 2012 and is based on the 12th floor of Guy’s hospital in London. It employs more than 100 people and has government backing through Innovate UK but also gets private funding through partnerships. It is building a £55m cell therapy manufacturing centre in Stevenage. Islexa will use CGT’s labs at Guy’s and facilities at Aberdeen University.

They are looking for investors to take Islexa all the way as a fully fledged external company. The promising early results have given them the confidence to form a wider consortium with the Scottish Islet Transplant Programme, the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.

The result is likely to surprise many skeptics who did not believe insulin could be delivered orally because they doubted it could survive the onslaught of digestive juices so it could have the intended effect.

Oramed uses a protective coating and a high-enough dose of insulin so that most of it can be destroyed and still deliver a clinically beneficial amount of the hormone.

The positive results must be replicated in a larger Phase III trial before the drug, known as ORMD-0801, can be submitted for approval. But the data from the Phase II, 180-patient trial represents a major milestone.

“It’s been a long trip but it’s finally at the point that it’s beyond a doubt, the oral insulin works,” Nadav Kidron, chief executive of Jerusalem-based Oramed, said in a telephone interview.

The 28-day study involved patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled by metformin. They were dosed before bed time and had their overnight glucose levels continuously monitored. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo.

There were no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, the company said. Oramed said it plans to publish more detailed data from the study once it has had time to analyze the full results.

While insulin is typically associated with type 1 diabetes, many patients with type 2 eventually see their disease progress to the point where they need insulin. Type 2 accounts for more than 90 percent of the nearly 400 million people with diabetes worldwide.

A safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.

The main attraction of an insulin pill, aside from avoiding injections, is that it comes much closer to the path of natural insulin, which is produced in the pancreas and goes directly to the liver. ORMD-0801 goes from the gut to the liver, while injected insulin circulates throughout the body before it gets there.

story_reviews_00434,"LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Psilocybin, the psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms, may one day be an effective treatment for patients with severe depression who fail to recover using other therapies, scientists said on Tuesday.

A small-scale pilot study of psilocybin’s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said.

Of 12 patients given the drug, all showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven continued to show a positive response at three months. Five remained in remission beyond the three months.

Robin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London’s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking.

Many patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world.

“But we shouldn’t get carried away with these results,” he told reporters at a briefing in London. “This isn’t a magic bullet. We’re just learning how to do this treatment.”

Magic mushrooms grow worldwide and have been used since ancient times, both for recreation and for religious rites.

British researchers led by David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, have been exploring the potential of psilocybin to ease severe forms of depression in people who don’t respond to other treatments.

The World Health Organization estimates that some 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression, a common mental disorder characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, tiredness, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, and poor concentration.

Many patients respond to treatment with anti depressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, but around 20 percent don’t get better and are classed as having treatment-resistant depression.

Psilocybin acts on the serotonin system, suggesting it could be developed for treating depression. But hallucinogenic drugs can also cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so Nutt’s team wanted to find out if psilocybin can be given safely.

The trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They all went through a full screening process before being allowed to participate and they were fully supported before, during and after they received psilocybin.

The patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.

Blood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored during each session, and the patients were seen by a psychiatrist the next day and one, two, three and five weeks after the second dose.

Carhart-Harris said no serious side effects were reported during the study, although all volunteers said they were slightly anxious before and during initial drug administration.

“Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place,” he said. “I wouldn’t want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky.”

Nutt said the results showed that psilocybin “is safe and fast acting, so may - if administered carefully - have value for these patients.”","Magic mushroom ingredient may ease severe depression, study suggests",3,Reuters
story_reviews_00435,"Reviving Memory With An Electrical Current

Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a 63-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease experienced something she hadn't for 55 years: a memory of her 8-year-old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland.



The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.

Right now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.

In 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.

Using a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.

That our memories — so entwined with our personalities and senses of self — might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.

Yet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.

The study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. ""The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,"" explains Lozano. ""It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function."" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.

Next, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.

Preliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.

Given that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.

In terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.

More intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.

Reversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.

Lozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents — requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. ""We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,"" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.

Evidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved – meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.

A group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.

Despite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.

Referring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, ""The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.""

However he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.

""The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,"" he says. ""But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.""

In a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim – and inspired by Lozano's initial paper — House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.

DBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. ""Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,"" cautions Lozano.

Yet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections – albeit random ones – and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.

""We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,"" says Lozano. ""We want to turn these brain networks back on.""

story_reviews_00436,"NEW YORK -- Debbie Spina is a supervisor for the radiology department at the Hospital for Joint Diseases at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. But when CBS News met her this spring, she was a patient who was about to undergo same-day hip replacement surgery.

The 61-year-old had been having hip pain for the past two years because of arthritis. She had heard a lot of positive feedback from people who had undergone hip replacement surgery at her hospital. A big attraction for her was the possibility of going home right after the surgery.

""The option to go home the same day and have that family around me was something that I wanted to do,"" said Spina.

She believed she would be able to recuperate more comfortably at home and get back on her feet faster.

At most hospitals, hip replacement patients can expect a one- to three-night hospital stay. Total hip replacement surgery is increasingly common, with more than 300,000 procedures done every year in the U.S. The surgery is meant to restore range of motion and help relieve arthritic pain. The procedure consists of removing the patient's worn out ball and socket joint and inserting an artificial socket. On the femur side, a stem is inserted into the bone and a ball is on the tip of it.

NYU Langone Medical Center said it became the first academic medical center in New York City to implement a same-day hip replacement program, in 2015.

Dr. Roy Davidovitch, director of NYU Langone's Hip Center, said he performs around 400 hip replacements a year and approximately 40 percent of those patients will go home the same day.

Davidovitch said patients are happier going home sooner. ""Nothing beats the comfort of your own home for recovery. And to be quite honest, if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital. It really doesn't make sense.""

There are two common surgical approaches for a total hip replacement: anterior, which involves entering surgically through the front of the hip, and posterior, or entering surgically through the side or buttocks.

According to research done by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, there are no significant differences between either approach in recovery outcomes six months after surgery.

Davidovitch favors the anterior approach, which he believes has a faster and less painful recovery period in the short term because doctors don't have to cut through muscles or tendons to get to the hip like in the posterior approach. He does agree that in the long term, both procedures have the same outcomes for patients.

The anterior approach to hip replacement may result in a quicker short-term recovery, but over the long run patients' outcomes are the same. CBS News

But it's not the surgical approach alone that allows some of his patients to go home the same day -- it's a combination of what happens before, during and after surgery.

At NYU Langone patients have to do what's called pre-hab. Before the surgery they work with an occupational and physical therapist to learn information on the procedure, learn exercises to do after the surgery and how to properly move around while they are recovering.

During the surgery, Davidovitch uses a short-acting spinal anesthetic that lasts about 2 ½ hours, and when closing the wound he injects ""a cocktail of medications"" to help with the inflammation and pain.

Patients can be up and walking usually within three hours after the surgery.

But they must have someone around the first night they are spending at home post-surgery.

""The people who are against the whole idea for same-day discharge for hip replacement are concerned about the very rare instances where somebody could develop a blood clot that goes to the lung, or a fracture of some sort,"" said Davidovitch. ""The rates of blood clots or pulmonary emboli is exceedingly low. And in general, if a patient is identified as a high risk or a higher risk we don't send them home the same day.""

Dr. Davidovitch and his surgical team performing a hip replacement. NYU Langone Medical Center

Davidovitch makes it clear that this kind of surgery is not one-size-fits-all. Patients are screened first to make sure they don't have risk factors like obesity, chronic liver disease or cardiac problems. Those who have risk factors must plan on staying overnight in the hospital, not going right home.

However, not every surgeon is embracing the same-day trend. Douglas E. Padgett, M.D., chief of the joint replacement service at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, is a lot more conservative about who he believes is the optimal patient for going home the same day.

""The number of patients that are going home at this point in time in our institution is somewhere between one and two percent. So it's a relatively small percentage of patients that are going directly home,"" said Padgett.

Padgett has seen an increase in the number of hip replacement patients and a decrease in their age -- some are as young as their 40s and 50s. He said his department performs the most hip replacements of any institution in the U.S., doing about 5,000 a year. While he is not against patients going home the same day, he cautions that total joint replacement is a major procedure and doctors need to be careful to avoid sending patients home too soon.

""While I recognize there is no place like home, should there be the need for urgent or medical care the question is will that be available to the patient when they're in the setting of their own home,"" Padgett said.

Debbie Spina met all the requirements to go home the same day. Her surgery lasted about an hour, which is the average time for her type of procedure. After the the operation she was able to move around but felt dizzy and nauseous. The occupational and physical therapists waited until evening to try and get her to go up and down steps and walk around, which patients must be able to do before they are discharged. But Spina didn't feel well enough, so she actually ended up spending the night.

Even though her same-day discharge didn't go as planned, Spina felt good the following morning and was able to do her exercises and leave the hospital.

After her recovery is complete, she has a few goals she'd like to reach. ""I had walked prior to this four miles every morning -- I'd like to do that. And I'd like to improve my golf game if possible,"" Spina said while smiling.

Davidovitch's goal is for patients to return to their normal level of activity as quickly as possible. And with many people wanting to maintain active lifestyles well into their 70s and beyond, he expects to see even greater demand for hip replacement surgery and the same-day option. ""In general I see this growing to about 60 percent of my practice,"" he said.",Same-day hip replacements get patients back on their feet,2,CBS News

A body mass index under 25 is deemed normal and healthy, and a higher BMI that's ""overweight"" or ""obese"" is not. But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.

The body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the ""normal"" weight category, to 27, which is deemed ""overweight.""

That means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

The researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.

The risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called ""normal"" weight.

So being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.

""I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,"" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.

So he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.

So what's going on?

""Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,"" Nordestgaard says. ""One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.""

That includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.

People in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.

Or you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.

Researchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. ""This is total speculation,"" Nordestgaard says.

The BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.

Nordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.

But this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.",Does Putting On A Few Pounds Help You Cheat Death?,3,NPR
story_reviews_00438,"Fruits and vegetables are staples in a healthy diet, and that includes one aimed at preventing cancer. Many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce, and avoid things like red and processed meat.

But the majority of those studies have focused on adults, and it’s becoming clear that many of cancer’s drivers start early in life, with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens.

To investigate this further, Maryam Farvid, a research associate at Massachusetts General Hospital and a visiting scientist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a study reported in the BMJ, they plumbed the Nurses’ Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.

About half of the 90,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens. Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.

MORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies

Certain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer — apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.

Farvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth. Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.

“This study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,” says Farvid. “This study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.”

Farvid wasn’t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn’t powered enough to detect an effect.

The findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.

The results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit’s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. “We recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,” says Farvid, “because maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.”

In another study also published in the BMJ, a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years. The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.

Taken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman’s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.

One of the first applications, said Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest, a dermatology professor who is part of the research team, was on undereye bags, a condition that plagues so many middle-aged and older people.

“We wanted something that is elegant, and the ultimate test is right there on your face,” she said. “You really can’t see it. It’s there. It looks normal. We saw that as a very high bar. If you can achieve that you’ve done something impressive.”

(The researchers emphasize that the second skin is significantly different from a product that Living Proof tried to market a few years ago as a cosmetic that could correct undereye bags.)

Those studies included tests on people with undereye bags and those with dry skin on their legs. In one study, participants put second skin on their forearms to see how quickly the skin returned to normal after it was pinched in a suction cup — a test of elasticity. In another study, people were randomly assigned to use second skin or a placebo under their eyes. Trained observers graded the subjects on the appearance of the undereye skin. The product’s durability was tested in volunteers who wore it while running in heat and working up a sweat, while swimming, and while going out in a rainstorm.

One of the important uses, the researchers said, is in treating eczema and the sort of dry skin that comes with aging, with dry itchy patches on the back and legs that keep people up at night, scratching.

“We tell people to pat their skin with a damp washcloth and put on a heavy moisturizer, but that only lasts a short time,” Dr. Gilchrest said. “They end up with greasy goo all over the sheets, and they wake up in the middle of the night, terribly uncomfortable. We need something that was easier to use and didn’t make a mess and stays. Which is what this stuff does.”

Another application of the second skin is to keep drugs like cortisone creams on the skin, Dr. Anderson said.

SUNDAY, May 8, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Countless people -- often men with enlarged prostates -- need to visit the bathroom during the night. But help could soon be at hand in the form of a nasal spray, new research suggests.

A spritz of a synthetic hormone, already used by bed-wetting kids, might benefit older people struggling with the problem called nocturia.

""Nocturia is very common in patients over 50 years old, and can cause significant problems by causing loss of sleep, and injury due to falls,"" said study lead author Dr. Jed Kaminetsky.

The millions of people with nocturia wake up two or more times a night to urinate. Besides an enlarged prostate, Kaminetsky said, common causes are bladder problems, poor circulation and obesity.

Kaminetsky is a clinical assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.

In the United States there's no approved drug to treat the problem, the study authors said.

The new drug, while promising, is of concern because of its potential to lower blood sodium levels in the elderly, one doctor said. Meanwhile, another researcher suggested that exercise might help stave off nocturia.

Known as SER-120, the nasal spray contains desmopressin, a low-dose synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone vasopressin. Vasopressin, an anti-diuretic, reduces urine production.

SER-120 appears to delay urine production for four to six hours during sleep, said Kaminetsky, ""and wears off by morning when patients awaken and start to drink fluids.""

He is scheduled to present his team's research Sunday in San Diego at a meeting of the American Urological Association. The research was funded by the spray's manufacturer, Serenity Pharmaceuticals.

Desmopressin is commonly used to treat bed-wetting among children ages 6 and up, the study authors pointed out.

To assess its potential in adults, the study team enlisted nearly 1,400 men and women, 50 and older, who had a history of nocturia.

For three months, participants were randomly assigned to use either the desmopressin spray (two doses were tried) or a non-medicinal spray (a placebo).

Patients kept three-day urination diaries, and filled out quality-of-life questionnaires.

Desmopressin spray prompted ""a significant decrease"" in the frequency of nightly bathroom trips compared with the untreated group, Kaminetsky said. On average, patients reported at least two fewer episodes a night.

The treatment group also experienced a ""significant increase"" in the length of time they could sleep before awakening to urinate. That uninterrupted sleep period extended to more than four hours, Kaminetsky said.

The researchers also found that those in the higher-dose spray group experienced a ""significant improvement"" in overall quality of life, compared with the untreated group.

Though SER-120 is still considered investigational, Kaminetsky said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the findings, with a possible decision late this year.

Dr. Tomas Griebling, a professor of urology at the University of Kansas, described the study results as ""promising,"" but added a note of caution.

""Other researchers have examined the utility and safety of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturia in the past,"" he said. ""However, there have been concerns about safety, particularly in elderly patients.""

Griebling said the American Geriatrics Society includes desmopressin in the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medications for older adults, primarily because of concerns about resulting low blood sodium levels.

But the lower doses used in this study (1.5 or 0.75 mcg) ""may help to improve the overall safety profile, particularly for geriatric patients,"" he said. ""Additional research will be needed to fully answer this question in the future.""

The study team said two of the higher-dose patients developed significantly low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) as did one person taking the placebo.

Dr. Julien Dagenais, a urologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, explored nocturia from another angle. He analyzed physical activity data reported by more than 10,000 men and women (aged 20 and older) in a U.S. health and nutrition survey conducted between 2005 and 2010.

People who reported higher levels of exercise were less likely to suffer from nocturia, Dagenais found. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory impact of routine exercise may minimize nocturia, he said.

These findings will also be presented at the American Urological Association meeting. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00442,"Carbohydrates sound so innocent: mere starches, sugar and fiber that the body uses for energy. Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.

But out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called “resistant starch,” suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.

When we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them—which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.

But that’s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they’re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics—food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.

Those benefits—getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria—set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.

“Certain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,” says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. “In my belief, that’s what’s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.”

Luckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.

Most intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. “Cooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,” Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. “The ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,” Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.

In all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a Nutrition Journal study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant—much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.

Arciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero’s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. “After you eat a meal that’s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,” he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found—which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. “If you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that’s a pretty powerful combination,” Arciero says.

It’s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people lose weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. “The potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don’t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,” Arciero says—especially when it’s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.

story_reviews_00443,"Every month, some 50 percent of women suffer from monthly period-related pain. And there's not a whole lot they can do beyond trying to blunt it with pain-relieving pills or oral contraceptives.

Whoopi Goldberg recently stepped in with a new line of medical marijuana–based edibles and bath products (of questionable effectiveness) aimed at this underserved market.

Now there's Livia, a medical device that's being marketed as the ""off switch for menstrual pain.""

Here's how it works: Users simply attach two electrodes to the areas on their abdomen that hurt and switch on the colorful, palm-size gadget. According to Livia's makers, the device immediately sends nerve-stimulating electric pulses through the two electrodes, and poof! — the pain is gone.

Livia has received rave reviews in international women's magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour, and more than 3,000 crowdfunders from around the world have put upward of $284,000 into Livia's Indiegogo campaign. For now, it's only possible to preorder the device (at a cost of $85) and wait six months for it to ship.

As far as gadgetry for women's health goes, this one is novel. But does Livia actually work? There's no good way to evaluate that right now, since Livia's makers haven't made the findings of their studies on the device's effects public.

But there's some reason for optimism: The device is basically a repackaging of another (cheaper) technology that has already been proven to help women who suffer with their monthly cycles.

Livia is essentially TENS 2.0

To learn more about Livia, I reached out to Chen Nachum, the company's founder and CEO. He explained that the key to the device is TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), those electronic nerve stimulators you've probably seen in strip malls that hook up to the body to treat neck or back pain. (They're also available on the internet's strip mall, Amazon.)

TENS devices are generally thought to work through the ""pain-gate theory"" of pain. ""The idea is the nerve system cannot work with two types of signals at the same time,"" Nachum explained, ""so what Livia does is transmit frequency to the nerve system that it is very similar to the body's frequency, but it's not something the body knows.""

When the frequency from the device hits the brain faster than the pain, the brain takes that signal first and is distracted from the menstrual aches, the company claims.

So far, Nachum said they have tested the device on 163 women in two different trials — and more than 80 percent experienced relief with the device. The company is currently working on another study, which will include about 60 women.



Based on these studies, Nachum is trying to get Food and Drug Administration approval to market Livia as a menstrual pain reliever.

Doctors already prescribe TENS for period pain

Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN and pain medicine specialist, noted that the idea of using TENS for menstrual pain is actually very sound. In fact, there's enough research that the Cochrane Collaboration was able to put together a review of the evidence. Its conclusion: ""High-frequency nerve stimulation may help relieve painful menstrual cramps.""

In an email, Gunter said she frequently prescribes high-frequency TENS (pulses between 50 and 120 hertz at a low intensity) to treat patients who suffer through their periods: ""I have done so for more than 15 years. Prescribed one this morning in fact."" They really help some women, she added.

The benefit here is that, unlike anti-inflammatories and oral contraceptives, TENS is a non-drug intervention, and according to the Cochrane Review, there's research that suggests women even take fewer pain relievers when using these devices.

Gunter's main question about Livia is whether it will be significantly different from the already available and effective TENS devices, which usually cost around $35. ""Nothing [the CEO] has disclosed makes Livia sound like anything other than a TENS unit,"" she wrote. ""So I guess it's an expensive, pink TENS unit?""



(The company says the device would retail at $149, about the cost of four TENS units. But this assumes Livia will take off enough to justify retailing.)



Gunter also wondered whether Livia will be high frequency enough to be helpful. As that Cochrane review found, low-frequency TENS don't seem to do much to cut pain for women.



When I asked Nachum about the device's frequency, he said, ""We can't share this information at this point.""



And while he claims that Livia is more effective at treating period pain than the cheaper, already available TENS units (he said ""its frequency and wave shape are unique and optimized especially for relieving menstrual pain""), without publicly available studies comparing the two, all we have to go on is his word. (The Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wouldn't comment on Livia because no studies on it have been published.)



For now, Gunter pointed out, the TENS units that are already available can help women — and raising awareness about that might be Livia's biggest benefit.

""If [Livia] gets more women to know about TENS, then great,"" she said. ""[B]ut to call it something new or different seems disingenuous, unless of course they have published ... data that says otherwise.""","This new device claims to be the ""off switch for menstrual pain.""

story_reviews_00444,"An Online Program May Help Prevent Depression In Some People

Enlarge this image toggle caption WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images

Working through a self-help program online can prevent or delay major depression disorder in people who are vulnerable, a study finds. Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.

Online programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas.

In this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.

In the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.

For the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into ""manageable"" and ""unmanageable""; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.

Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.

After completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.

The control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.

The study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

Of the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.

It is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.

It's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.

Other experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.

""More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,"" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.

""I was surprised by the big response to our study,"" Buntrock wrote. ""And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members. It's a success story you might dream of when you start, but it actually seeing to happen is a great feeling.""",An Online Program May Help Prevent Depression In Some People,3,NPR
story_reviews_00445,"Scientists have some great news for those who love coffee, tea and wine: Drinking any of these beverages is associated with a healthier and more diverse community of microbes living in the gut.

The opposite is true for consuming sugary drinks and whole milk, as well as for eating a lot of carbohydrates and indulging in frequent snacks, researchers reported this week in the journal Science.

In other words, when it comes to the makeup of your gut microbiome, you are what you eat -- and drink.

“In total we found 60 dietary factors that influence diversity,” said Dr. Alexandra Zhernakova, a researcher at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the first author of the study, in a statement. “But there is good correlation between diversity and health: greater diversity is better.”

Your microbiome is the community of mostly beneficial bacteria, fungi and viruses that live on and in your body. These microscopic organisms earn their keep by helping you process food and regulating your immune system. Experts believe that the makeup of a person’s microbial community can also play a role in mood disorders, obesity and other diseases including irritable bowel syndrome.

But the study of the microbiome is relatively new, and scientists are still working out exactly what a healthy microbiome looks like.

Zhernakova and her colleagues helped fill in that picture by analyzing the microbes inside the guts of more than 1,100 people. They identified 126 factors that were correlated with changes in the makeup of an individual’s microbial community. These include 60 related to diet, 12 associated with diseases, 19 linked with drugs and four tied to smoking.

“To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess such a broad range of host and environmental factors in relation to gut microbiome and at such a large scale,” said Jingyuan Fu, a systems geneticist at the University of Groningen who worked with Zhernakova.

The researchers analyzed stool samples of 1,135 Dutch participants in the Lifelines-DEEP study. The participants collected their own stool samples at home and then immediately put them in the freezer.

No more than a few days later, the samples were transported to labs at the university, where they remained frozen until they were processed by researchers. This ensured that none of the bacteria had a chance to grow or change from the time the sample was collected. Also, it guaranteed that all samples were treated the same way.

“In situations where samples are sent by post at room temperature, the time of the delivery for every sample is different,” she said. “That situation can lead to the growth of bacteria during transportation and adds additional ‘noise’ to the findings.”

After analyzing the samples and comparing them with other data collected in the Lifelines-DEEP study, the scientists found that consuming fruits, vegetables and yogurt positively influenced microbial diversity in the gut. So did drinking tea, wine, coffee and buttermilk.

On the flip side, sugary sodas and savory snacks were associated with lower levels of diversity. So was having irritable bowel syndrome and smoking during pregnancy.

Women tend to have more microbial diversity than men, and older people have greater microbial diversity than younger people, the researchers found.

The study does not address exactly why certain foods and behaviors influence the mix of microbes that populate a person’s gut. However, the researchers report that people who eat a lot of yogurt and buttermilk had higher levels of the bacteria that are used in the making of those foods in their guts.

”For more complex food, such as fruits and vegetables, we don’t know the answer,” Fu said. “We can suggest that changes in fiber content and carbohydrate composition are playing a role, but this should be studied in detail in respect to every food item.”

Fu also outlined many areas of research that the group hopes to tackle next. She said they are hoping to expand the study to 10,000 participants and follow them over time. They also want to collect samples from the nose and throat.

In a related study, researchers combed through thousands of human fecal samples to create a catalog of the microorganisms that colonize the human digestive system. They identified species of microorganisms from at least 664 different genera in the guts of close to 4,000 adults from the U.S., the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.

When they expanded their collection of stool samples to include a small number of people from Papua New Guinea, Peru and Tanzania, the researchers detected a core group of 14 genera of microbes that were just about universally present.

These 14 genera were common to 95% of the humans sampled, and the species within these groups accounted for about 72% of their total gut microbiome. The main difference between individual people was the relative abundance of microbes from these core groups, including species from the Ruminococcaceae family and from the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella.

The researchers found several links between the diversity of gut flora and various aspects of biological function. For instance, people who reported looser stools were more likely to have a rich garden of microflora than those whose stools were harder and dryer.

The researchers also found significant associations between people’s genus abundance and their hip circumference, history of taking the antibiotic amoxicillin, uric acid concentrations (a factor in gout) and their preference for eating dark chocolate.

More than any single factor, the use of a wide range of drugs influenced microbiome variation among the people in this study. The clearest patterns emerged in those who had a recent history of taking antibiotics, osmotic laxatives, medications for inflammatory bowel disease, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistamines or hormones used for birth control or to alleviate symptoms of menopause.

But contrary to some expectations, the data did not show that the abundance of microbes in the adult gut was influenced by whether the person was born in a vaginal delivery or by C-section. Nor did researchers find any evidence that those who were breast-fed as babies had more diverse microbiomes when they grew up.

Still, both studies underscore that a healthy microbiome is a key component of a healthy body, even if scientists are still working to understand exactly how each influences the other.

The day may come when patients routinely provide doctors with stool samples to help better understand their health, Fu said.

“It is becoming more and more clear that the gut microbiome serves as a sort of fingerprint that captures all kinds of signals about host health,” she said.

story_reviews_00446,"After surviving firefights and a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, U.S. Army veteran Asa Barrett tried antidepressant drugs and therapy to overcome depression and bouts of anger. Nothing worked.

But then, like many other foreigners, he journeyed to Peru’s remote Amazonian jungle to drink ayahuasca, a centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew that some Western scientists think can help to heal psychological traumas.

During a recent ayahuasca ritual, the 30-year-old from Oklahoma lay on a mattress with about 20 other travelers on the floor of a round, wooden hut in a remote resort near a tributary of the Amazon River. About 45 minutes after drinking the dark concoction, he began to see vibrant colors. He then vomited into a plastic bucket, a common reaction to ayahuasca.

Mr. Barrett acknowledged that it didn’t appear therapeutic. But he also described seeing visions of war-torn Afghanistan emerging as a shaman chanted spiritual songs called icaros. He recalled seeing bullet holes in a wall, a dead Afghan woman and the moment when an improvised explosive device almost killed him. He saw his small military base in Afghanistan’s mountainous border region with Pakistan. He heard a loud voice.

And then came a burst of light.

“It was as if I was just letting it all go,” Mr. Barrett said later. “I just felt so at ease for the first time in a long time.”

In the Amazon, scientists have long studied plants with a range of medicinal properties. Some work as anesthetics; others can treat infections; some are known to stop bleeding. Now scientists are starting to look at ayahuasca, a potent hallucinogen known locally as “the vine of the soul” that outsiders are increasingly flocking to sample.

Scientists say that ayahuasca—which is legal in Peru and neighboring countries—activates parts of the brain that make it possible to recall deep-rooted memories, increasing self-awareness and offering a chance to reassess past ordeals. Proponents say that it can provide users with spiritual and personal guidance. Others report that it has allowed them to overcome traumas that conventional therapy and antidepressants haven’t cured.

But some scientists—and users—warn that ayahuasca can be dangerous. It can be fatal when mixed with other drugs, such as antidepressants, and should be avoided by those who are bipolar or schizophrenic, since it has been known to trigger psychotic episodes. In 2012, a young man from California died after taking ayahuasca in Peru. And last year a Canadian tourist killed a Briton during a nighttime ritual that local authorities are still investigating.

The brew is made by boiling together a jungle vine called Banisteriopsis caapi with the leaves of a shrub that contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a psychedelic that is illegal in the U.S. DMT can cause seizures and, in high doses, comas and respiratory arrests, said Mike Colston, a U.S. Navy captain who heads a Department of Defense agency in charge of studying psychological health and brain injury. The hallucinations caused by ayahuasca can be so traumatic that they can worsen medical conditions such as PTSD, Dr. Colston cautioned.

In Peru, the influx of foreigners eager to try the brew has spurred the creation of unregulated new lodges to try ayahuasca, some of which, locals say, are opportunistic and employ fake shamans with little training. The brew itself is unregulated by the Peruvian government.

Ayahuasca’s proponents say that it has powerful properties. Jeffrey Hill, a 38-year-old construction superintendent from Chicago, said that ayahuasca eased his depression. Juliet Wilkerson, 41, who lives in Texas, said that it helped to cure her debilitating migraines, which she thinks were tied to childhood abuse. Jaylene Johnston, a 53-year-old from Oklahoma, said she had visions of her deceased first husband that allowed her to overcome the trauma of his death and fully commit to her current spouse. “It transformed the relationships that I have right now,” she said.

The California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies aims to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the FDA for a study in the U.S. Photo: iStock

The stories might seem surreal. But they have prompted growing interest by Western researchers, amid a wider revival of studies into the therapeutic use of psychedelics.

The California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which has funded researchers at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, plans to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an ayahuasca study in the U.S.

Jessica Nielson, a University of California, San Francisco, neuroscientist who is leading the study, became interested in the potion after trying it herself following a difficult divorce and doubts about her career trajectory. In Peru, she saw how it helped three military veterans.

“Just witnessing their transformation inspired me,” she said. But she cautioned that ayahuasca research is in its infancy. “We really need to get more data on this to understand the safety, what are the limits and who is it appropriate for,” she said.

Other scientists are hoping to understand the brew’s properties. Charles Grob, a psychiatrist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center who studied ayahuasca’s use in a Brazilian church, says that it might help to treat addiction. Jordi Riba, a pharmacologist at the Sant Pau Institute of Biomedical Research in Barcelona, says that ayahuasca may help ease depression.

Because the experience can be frightening, both men emphasized the importance of consuming the brew in a safe setting A.J. Bullock, a 30-year-old Army sergeant who served in Afghanistan, described nightmarish hallucinations of being chained down and confronted by demons after trying ayahuasca in Peru. It made him feel paranoid, he said, and he considered going home early. By his last ritual, he described a helpful, “radical shift in self-image.” Still, he hesitates to recommend the experience.

“I just don’t know if a lot of people would be able to walk away from it not having gone crazy or at least hurting them more than it helped them,” he said.

Despite the risks, foreigners are converging on Iquitos, a city of 500,000 in Peru’s northeastern Amazon, paying up to $2,500 a week to drink the elixir. Carmen Rojas, the head of the local tourism office, says that she knows of 22 certified jungle lodges that offer ayahuasca. But local tour operators speak of dozens more, including almost 100 ayahuasca centers along one 60-mile stretch of highway. They estimate that as many as 80,000 people a year come to Iquitos for ayahuasca.

One operator, Pulse Tours, says that its clients are mainly Americans and Canadians but also include people from as far away as Australia, China, Russia and Kazakhstan.

Some longtime ayahuasca proponents in Iquitos lament the recent influx of tourism dollars, which they feel has corrupted the ritual and put some foreigners at risk from fly-by-night operators in the burgeoning industry.

“People have got way too careless about all of this,” said Howard Lawler, 68, a Kentucky native who runs Spirit Quest Shamanic Sanctuary, one of the longest-running ayahuasca centers here. “It is never to be taken for any recreational purpose. It is a very serious medicine.”

He places the small animals in her palms, and they skitter in tiny circles, tickling her skin. “Now,” says Gessler. “Which one used to have Canavan disease?”

A few miles away, at Epstein’s home in Worcester, Massachusetts, a young woman lies in bed, her thin limbs bent and still, her curly red hair splayed across a pillow. This is Rachel, Epstein’s 17-year-old daughter, born with Canavan disease—a debilitating, fatal brain disorder. As a newborn, Rachel opened her mouth as if to scream but made no sound. As an infant, she never moved in her sleep. When Rachel failed to lift her head by six months of age, an early intervention therapist suspected she had cerebral palsy. Epstein wishes it had been so. Instead, Rachel had inherited a mutated version of a gene called ASPA from each of her parents. Without a healthy copy of that gene, her cells could not produce a protein needed to break down acid in the brain. So the acid built up, then slowly ate away at the insulation protecting Rachel’s neurons, turning her white matter into a sponge pocketed with fluid-filled sacs. As a result, Rachel does not talk; she cannot see or control her limbs or other bodily functions; she has seizures and will likely not live to adulthood.

There is no treatment and no cure for Canavan disease. Yet standing in a room at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, Epstein holds a mouse that once had the same symptoms as Rachel—but now runs effortlessly over her outstretched fingers. Weeks before, the mouse was treated with a single intravenous injection of a gene therapy drug developed in the lab of Gessler’s doctoral adviser, microbiologist Guangping Gao. The drug is the fruit of Gao’s 23-year career in gene therapy.

Gao did not always believe the drug would ever make it out of the laboratory, because the field of gene therapy has been plagued with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, including the deaths of test subjects. Over the past five years, however, there has been a resurgence of gene therapy in neuroscience. Scientists now argue it is our best, and perhaps only, chance at curing many diseases of the brain. And attuned to the multibillion-dollar potential of this new class of drugs, large pharmaceutical companies including Novartis, Shire, AstraZeneca and GSK are joining the fray. More than 20 biotech companies are currently developing viral gene therapies while others are working to directly edit genes.

“Gene therapies are coming along fast and furious. They’re going to earn their place,” says Kevin Starr, co-founder of Third Rock Ventures, a venture capital firm invested in three gene therapy companies. “We are probably in the greatest innovative period of understanding human disease and how to make cures ever.”

A FedEx Truck to the Brain

The concept of gene therapy is straightforward, beautiful even: Fix an illness caused by a faulty gene by replacing or supplementing a healthy new copy of the gene. In other words, use genes as medicine. For example, one of the earliest human tests of gene therapy was in 1990, when two young girls with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) received repeated infusions of their own white blood cells modified to fix a defective gene. It worked—with continued treatments, both children showed signs of a restored immune system and went on to lead normal lives.

Gao first met a Canavan patient in 1993, at a party celebrating his discovery of the gene and mutations that caused the disorder. A family wheeled over their 6-year-old with Canavan disease to the young scientist, who realized that the boy had donated tissue to his research project. “I’d held his DNA in my hands. I had found what was wrong with his DNA,” recalls Gao, then a Ph.D. student. Yet he had no way to fix it. At that moment, “I knew what I would do for the rest of my life—find a cure for the disease,” says Gao. “And other than gene therapy, there was no other way.”

Gene therapy is well-suited for treating inherited brain diseases. First, most drugs can’t get through the brain’s formidable blood-brain barrier, but something small, like a virus with a healthy gene tucked inside, can do it. Additionally, the brain is a closed compartment, so the risks of gene therapy are minimized—other parts of the body, the liver or the lungs, say, are undisturbed.

In the early ’90s, Gao was a student without a lab of his own. So he sought out James Wilson at the University of Pennsylvania, a rising star in the field of gene therapy. For the next 13 years, Gao would work for Wilson, engineering new and better viruses for the therapies, called “viral vectors.” These molecular FedEx trucks can be loaded with healthy versions of genes and deliver them to the correct location in the body.

Gao was in the right place at the right time. By 1999, more than 115 gene therapy clinical trials were approved in the U.S, ranging in illnesses from cancer to blood disorders to graft-versus-host disease. Wilson eagerly moved from the lab into human trials, starting with five studies utilizing a modified version of an adenovirus, a common virus known to cause respiratory infections in people. One of those trials enrolled a teenager named Jesse Gelsinger.

Gelsinger suffered from a genetic liver condition kept under control with pills and diet, but he volunteered for the study to help find a cure for infants with a fatal form of his disorder. When Gelsinger received the gene therapy in September 1999, the adenoviral vector triggered a violent immune response that damaged his liver and shut down his lungs. Four days after the injection, he was dead.

His death shuttered gene therapy funding and research in the United States. Europeans continued on, buoyed by an announcement in 2000 that gene therapy had cured a group of 20 children with SCID. But within a few years, five of them had developed leukemia from the treatment. One died, and scientists fled the field. Gao, who was not directly involved in the clinical trial that led to Gelsinger’s death, doesn’t like to talk about it now, saying only that he doesn’t blame Wilson. Gao kept his head down and quietly continued to work on other types of safer viral vectors.

The most promising candidate was adeno-associated virus (AAV)—a virus that grows in the presence of adenovirus but is a completely different type. AAVs are not quite as efficient as adenoviruses at getting genes into human cells, but they are much safer: The human immune system barely notices the virus’s outer coat or “dress,” as Gao calls it. And AAVs do not integrate into the genome of human cells, which is what caused leukemia in some of the SCID patients.

In 2008, Gao struck out on his own, taking a job as director of a brand-new gene therapy center at UMass. The paint on his office walls was still wet when Sherri Epstein walked in. A part-time administrative assistant in the building next door, Epstein had seen Gao’s appointment in a local newspaper. Epstein introduced herself and told Gao about Rachel and her previous attempt at gene therapy. Five years earlier, doctors running the first-ever Canavan gene therapy trial drilled six tiny holes into Rachel’s skull, inserted thin catheters and delivered their drug to parts of her brain. It was safe, but it didn’t work.

Not long after that initial meeting, Epstein brought Rachel to visit the lab. Once again, Gao was standing in front of a desperate parent and dying child.

At the time, only one gene therapy had been commercially approved in the world: a cancer drug in China. Regulators in the U.S. and Europe were highly skeptical of the safety and efficacy of such treatments. Gao knew he had to be careful and was determined to not repeat the errors of his predecessors by rushing into human trials. Instead, he spent the next eight years in the lab, methodically producing a novel gene therapy for Canavan disease. He has spent over $2 million in federal and university research funds developing and testing it in hundreds of mice with the disease.

Gessler, a young German scientist studying to be a neurosurgeon, joined the project in 2012 and has since led the optimization of the therapy, narrowing in on the ideal AAV vector to get into the brain—AAV9 won the spot—and an improved gene construct that produces 10 times as many copies of the needed protein as earlier versions. This most recent gene therapy is so good at slipping into the brain that Gessler is able deliver the drug intravenously into the blood, and it passes through the blood-brain barrier to penetrate all areas of the brain. No drilling into the skull required.

Gessler will never forget the first time he tested the optimized therapy in a live animal. He injected it into a young, sick mouse, hunched over with no control over its muscles. When Gessler returned to assess the results, he couldn’t find the mouse. He worried he had mislabeled a cage. He hadn’t. The mouse was there, acting just as healthy as the control mice.

Today, the treatment has cured Canavan disease in two different strains of mice engineered to have the disease. A dozen freezers line the long hallway in Gao’s laboratory, each filled to the brim with preserved tissues and viruses. “We have the therapy. We are ready,” says Gao, grinning like a schoolchild. The last barrier is financial but not impossible to overcome. Gao estimates it will require $10 million to $12 million to launch the first human clinical trials—but the potential profits are already attracting biotech attention. Two companies, which Gao declined to name, have approached him about getting involved in the effort.

Making the Billion-Dollar Bet

The office of Voyager Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, epitomizes a trendy startup: glass doors, whiteboard walls, minimalist orange-accented décor and a communal area with free drinks and snacks. It smells like caffeine and money.

But unlike tech startups, this office is flanked on either side by laboratories full of microscopes and viruses. The company is developing gene therapies for a handful of central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Lou Gehrig’s disease. Voyager CEO Steven Paul has worked in the pharmaceutical industry developing drugs for brain disorders for over 35 years and witnessed the tribulations of gene therapy. He’s ardent that now is finally the right time.

Investors agree. Venture firms have invested more in gene therapy since 2010 than they did during the whole previous decade, and therapies for the brain far and away lead the pack, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Last February, when Voyager was just a year old, it inked a deal with Genzyme for $100 million up front and up to $745 million in future milestone payments, including for the company’s severe brain disease programs. Voyager followed that with $60 million in investor financing in April and an $81 million initial public offering in November. Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics, developing gene therapies for rare eye diseases, accumulated $268 million in funding after going public in just two years and scoring a sizable licensing deal with Pfizer. Cambridge-based Bluebird Bio ended last year with a whopping $866 million in cash and cash equivalents.

It used to be that Big Pharma wasn’t interested in rare diseases: “Companies thought these markets were too small,” says Paul. But with the right price tag, even a therapy sold to only a few hundred patients can make billions. Glybera, the first European-approved gene therapy, sparked pricing debates when it debuted at $1.4 million per shot. While insurance companies and health care providers struggle to figure out what they are willing and able to recommend and pay for, there’s no doubt a market exists.

Gene therapy investments have become so abundant that some academics are turning from government support toward venture capital. R. Jude Samulski, who developed the first AAVs for gene therapy back in the 1980s, recently founded a biotech company in North Carolina, Bamboo Therapeutics, to tap into that revenue stream. It is developing therapies for rare genetic diseases that result in progressive nerve death, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Canavan disease, Friedreich’s ataxia and giant axonal neuropathy. The company expects to begin human trials as soon as next year.

Europe is beginning to see a trickle of gene therapy approvals, including a green light in April for a treatment of type of SCID. The U.S. field waits on an influx of positive clinical data. “Gene therapy will have a product in the U.S. approved by the FDA within two years,” says Gao. “For sure.” That will mostly likely be a treatment for the eyes; this past October, Spark had a Phase III win when a gene therapy to correct an inherited form of blindness successfully restored vision to the “maximum possible benefit” in 21 patients, according to the company. It plans to seek FDA approval for the treatment this year.

Bluebird is also in late-stage development of a gene therapy for the Lorenzo’s Oil disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, which, like Canavan’s, targets white matter in the brain. The therapy, Lenti-D, is performed on cells outside of the body: The company removes blood stem cells from bone marrow of a patient, treats them with a gene therapy in a dish, then washes out the virus, tests the gene-modified cells and re-infuses them into the patient’s body.

For all the recent improvements, gene therapy will not be a cure-all. For instance, the approach is less likely to improve diseases where more than one gene is implicated or the cause is not known. In conditions like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, for example, the approach may lead to symptomatic relief, but not a cure. And the risks have not entirely dissipated. “You always have to think of benefit versus risk with any therapy,” says Paul. “We pick diseases where the risk of not treating is very bad.”

Most children with Canavan disease die before age 10, though some survive into their 20s and 30s. While Gao and Gessler believe their therapy will be most effective in newborn infants who test positive for the mutation, they also can’t forget Rachel and other older Canavan patients. With them in mind, Gessler recently decided to test whether the therapy might also work for older mice. How long could he wait after a mouse had developed the disease to treat and still rescue it? Gessler administered the therapy in sick teenage mice (6 weeks old in human time), adult mice (12 weeks) and mature mice (24 weeks). Then he waited, nervously.

On a cold, bright day in February, I catch up with Gessler in Gao’s sixth-floor corner office. He is smiling. “We just got the one-year data for the six-week-treated mice,” Gessler says. “They are completely normal.”

After meeting with Gessler, I travel an hour north to a pediatric nursing home where Rachel now lives—a utilitarian brick building tucked behind Main Street in a quaint Massachusetts town. Rachel is lying in bed beneath a purple blanket, a unicorn pillow at her feet. An episode of Friends plays in the background.

Epstein is painting Rachel’s nails when I arrive. She adjusts the TV monitor closer to Rachel’s face. “She’s legally blind, but I think she understands everything,” says Epstein. She eventually asks about Gessler’s experiments treating older mice, a hint of hope in her voice. Epstein is not desperate—she has accepted Rachel’s lot in life—but like any parent, she will always desire the best for her child. I tell her about the recent mouse results, and she smiles. The sun outside is setting, and Epstein returns to painting her daughter’s nails, a bright bubble gum pink.","Gene Therapy Might Be the Best, and Perhaps Only, Chance at Curing Brain Diseases",3,Newsweek
story_reviews_00448,"The growing number of patients who claim marijuana has helped them drop their painkiller habit has intrigued lawmakers and emboldened advocates. Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.

It's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.

Advocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.

The research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.

In Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling ""like a zombie,"" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.

""Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,"" Ham said. ""Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.""

Bolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.

Authorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.

""I don't think it's a cure for everybody,"" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. ""But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?""

Most states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.

This month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called ""the number-one killer in Pennsylvania"" - opioid abuse.

""Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,"" Vereb said. ""Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer.""

""It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,"" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. ""But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.""

No place immune to America's opioid epidemic

In New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.

There are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.

""We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,"" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.

Cannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.

""If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,"" he said. ""However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.""

The findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.

Substance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.

""When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,"" Witman said. ""They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves. Most importantly, I'm able to get them back to gainful employment.""",Could marijuana help treat painkiller and heroin addiction?,3,CBS News
story_reviews_00449,"The Mediterranean diet includes lots of fish, plenty of fruits and vegetables, portions of whole grains, and very little meat. This classic diet does not exclude a dinnertime glass of wine, however, sugary drinks, fried food, and sweets are not on the menu. Scientists believe this style of eating offers some protection against mental aging, and, above all else, it is heart healthy.

A new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.

Participants eating a Mediterranean diet showed a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, the researchers discovered; yet, eating healthy food appeared to be more important than avoiding unhealthy foods identified as typical of a so-called Western diet, such as French fries, fatty red meats, and, yes, even cake. (Though diet names refer to regions, they are not precise.)

Led by Professor Ralph Stewart from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, a team of researchers asked 15,482 older adults with stable coronary artery disease to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. With an average age of 67, each was a participant in GlaxoSmithKline’s STABILITY drug trial, created to learn whether the drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Participants lived in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, and the Asia Pacific region.

They answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Looking at their answers, researchers gave them points in either the Mediterranean diet or Western diet category.

Over nearly four years, 1,588 (about 10 percent) of the study participants suffered either a heart attack or stroke, or died. Those who ate more foods in the Mediterranean diet category were 3.5 times less likely to experience one of these three events than people whose diets more closely resembled the Western standard.

In fact, every one-point increase in a participant’s Mediterranean diet score was linked with a 7 percent reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. Look at it this way: if 100 people ate the highest proportion of Mediterranean foods and 100 ate the least, there would be three fewer heart attacks, strokes, or deaths among those who ate more foods from the Mediterranean diet. These findings held for every geographical region.

Now here’s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy — those typical of Western diets —did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Eating more healthy foods was the key, even if some unhealthy foods were also consumed along the way.

According to Stewart, the meaning behind the numbers is clear. Instead of avoiding unhealthy foods, people with weak hearts might focus more on consuming healthy foods. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.

Long-standing American Heart Association guidelines recommend a diet primarily consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, and other whole foods, with limited amounts of sodium, sugar, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates. Eat as you dare.

story_reviews_00450,"A North Carolina teen said he's feeling ""hopeful"" after getting an infusion of stem cells during an experimental procedure that may help heal his heart and extend his life.

Caleb Sizemore, 19, was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy 12 years ago. The genetic disorder is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The disease can lead to scarring on muscles, including the heart. As scarring on the heart worsens, it affects the organ's ability to function and can be fatal.

In February, Sizemore became the first patient ever to get an infusion of stem cells into his heart in the hopes of stopping or even reversing some of the scarring related to the disease.

Dr. John Jefferies, director of advanced heart failure and cardiomyopathy at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, is treating Sizemore. He said a person suffering from Duchenne usually lives into his or her early 30s because of scarring on the heart.

""We’re going in and trying to reverse the scar tissue and potentially even mitigate the new development of scar tissue,"" Jefferies told ABC News. ""If we can preserve his cardiac function he has a fantastic outlook.""

Jefferies explained that the process works by allowing the stem cells to enter the heart, thus encouraging the heart to heal itself.

The stem cells ""create a healthy environment"" in the heart and help the tissue ""go from abnormal state to normal state,"" Jefferies noted.

Jefferies said if the medication works on patients like Sizemore, it could then be tested on millions of other Americans who have scarring on their heart due to the disease or past heart attacks.

""It is very exciting especially because of the impact it has on other kids and how it paves the way so that others can get the treatment and how this will change people’s lives and extend them,"" Sizemore said.

The teenager said he also has renewed optimism for his own health.

""It’s made me more hopeful,"" Sizemore said. ""Especially when I think of how amazing medical treatments and technology is and how far it’s gotten...especially since I was diagnosed 12 years ago.""

story_reviews_00451,"(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term “mini-strokes” offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half.

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris told Reuters Health by phone.

That’s because mini-strokes, also known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are often the harbinger of a potentially-deadly stroke that can come within a matter of hours or days.

“You should worry about symptoms even if they last for just a few seconds or a few minutes,” Amarenco said.

“The study showed that the widespread, systematic implementation of specialized TIA units across multiple sites, countries, and continents can make a difference in the care of these patients,” write Drs. Ralph Sacco and Tatjana Rundek of the University of Miami in an accompanying editorial.

The ongoing study, which used previous stroke estimates for comparison, was based on data from 4,789 patients from TIAregistry.org, an international registry designed to follow cases for as long as five years.

It didn’t include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence, but it “helps build the evidence base for the importance of getting in for early treatment,” said Dr. Donna Arnett, dean of public health at the University of Kentucky and past president of the American Heart Association.

Any kind of mini-stroke “should lead you to be evaluated,” said Arnett, who was not involved in the study.

Research reported prior to 2004 had suggested that the stroke risk is 10 percent two days after mini-stroke symptoms appear and between 8 percent and 20 percent for the 30- to 90-day period after symptom onset.

But in the new study, Amarenco and his colleagues found stroke risks of 1.5 percent at two days, 2.1 percent at seven days and 3.7 percent at 90 days when mini-strokes were treated aggressively.

One year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent.

“Although this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,” Sacco and Rundek write.

“The rate was remarkably lower,” Arnett told Reuters Health. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given.

The researchers also found that the one-year stroke risk doubled when multiple blood vessel clogs were seen with brain imaging, a large artery was narrowed by heart disease and the patient scored a 6 or 7 on a seven-point scale that assesses stroke risk factors.

More than two thirds of the patients in the study had a score of 4 or higher but the researchers caution that “limiting urgent assessment to patients with a score of 4 or more would miss approximately 20 percent of those with early recurrent strokes.”

story_reviews_00453,"Robison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.

For the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate — although not actually repeat — a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient’s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.

Beginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC’s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison’s new book, “Switched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.”

In a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of “Awakenings” and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones — and the not so welcome.

After his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. “The experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,” he writes. “Perhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.”

Other striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.

“The change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.

His book is likely to spark even greater interest — and funding — in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.

“My world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,” he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.

“I feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it’s there, or it really is there, it’s all the same,” added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.

Robison also happens to be a gifted writer — his 2007 memoir “Look Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger’s” was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He’s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.

Still, for all the positive changes described in “Switched On,” Robison’s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his “protective shield” of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.

His second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison’s public profile rose — since “Look Me in the Eye,” he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness — it disrupted his life on many levels.

At his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he’d never possessed caused “a mixture of sadness and wonder,” Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: “jarred.”

Robison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in “Running With Scissors,” the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison’s brother, Augusten Burroughs.

“Switched On” revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.

A “techno geek” with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems — he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS — Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS’s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School.

During the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they’ve had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an “improved” version of himself would be someone they could love as much.

“Some thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,” said Robison. “The technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely.”

Weighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, “I wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I’d concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, ‘Can’t you tell how happy you made us?’ Well, no, I’d say. I can’t.”

Even a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he’d been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves.

The negatives? These, too, he has come to accept.

“I was probably naive at the outset,” he admitted. “I had this idea that if I could only ‘get’ these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn’t occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering.”

Robison’s TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to “Switched On.” In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison’s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact.

Imagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue — an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he’s able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of “blue” will no longer be meaningless.

“Now translate that concept to emotions,” he continues. “If you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people.”

Nevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression.

Still, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. “People are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,” Pascual-Leone says. “Will it get more attention because of John’s book? Absolutely. But his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long-lasting, and detrimental.”

Robison remains optimistic that as research continues, the potential benefits will outweigh the risks.

“I owe a great debt [to the Harvard team] for helping me see I was not broken or defective,” he said. “That this painful disability of mine was a rare gift.”

“People are scared of the science-fiction aspect to this, but it’s real,” he added. “And what I wrote about in the book isn’t 10 percent of what they’re doing now.”

“Switched On” ends in 2013. Robison, now happily remarried, says he’s become even more militant advocating on behalf of what he calls “my tribe.”

“You can look at my success in the world,” he said, “and it’s not just in my mind. It’s undeniable.”

“The change [after the therapy] in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” Robison said. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff/Globe Staff

story_reviews_00455,"New research suggests that all women turning 40 should get a breast cancer risk assessment, since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away.

The finding is important because the latest guidelines on mammograms advise that most women can wait until the age of 45 or 50 to start having annual screenings.

But the review of female patients between the ages of 40 and 44 found that 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, and therefore would be eligible to begin screening mammography at age 40, said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Plichta. She's a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

How to navigate differing breast cancer screening guidelines

The study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said.

""We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40, and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing,"" Plichta said.

Plichta was to present her team's findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons.

The cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015, recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.

The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said. However, she noted the ASBS added a few extra conditions:

Women should start mammograms earlier than 45 if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than 15 percent.

Women with a 20 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening MRIs.

Women with a 5 percent or greater risk of a breast cancer-related genetic mutation should receive genetic testing.

""Critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment,"" Plichta said. ""Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing.""

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age 50. However, they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier.

The new study involved more than 900 women. None had been diagnosed with breast cancer. All were seen as new patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital breast clinic between March 2011 and October 2015, the researchers said.

Fifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. That includes 39 percent who met the ACS criteria for above-average risk for breast cancer, and an additional 11 percent who met the American Society of Breast Surgeons' criteria.

The researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups' eligibility standards for regular screening MRIs, and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing, Plichta said.

Breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted. Since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk, doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early 40s, they concluded.","Many women could benefit from earlier mammograms, analysis finds",2,HealthDay
story_reviews_00456,"Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center/ Batelle Ian Burkhart plays Guitar Hero as part of the study.

Ian Burkhart shouldn't be able to move his hands at all. The 24-year-old from Dublin, Ohio, was in an accident six years ago that left his arms and legs paralysed. But now, thanks to computer software that decodes his thoughts and sends the signal to his hands, he's been able to pick up small objects, swipe a credit card, and even play Guitar Hero – albeit in a science lab. This is the first time a person with paralysis has regained movement in their hands and individual fingers using signals from their brain. Details of the system that allows him to do this, developed by scientists at Ohio State University and Battelle Memorial Institute, are published in the journal Nature today. The study builds on previous work in which humans have been able to move computer cursors and robotic arms using their own brain signals, and a study in which monkeys with paralysed arms were able to move them again thanks to a similar intervention.

Nature Video / youtube.com Burkhart before his accident.

It was the summer after his freshman year of college when Burkhart lost the ability to move his arms and legs. ""I was 19 years old, really independent, and I didn't think anything like this would happen in my life that would slow me down and set me back this much,"" Burkhart said during a press briefing. ""I dove into a wave that then pushed me down into a sandbar – the water wasn't as deep as I thought. I was lucky to have friends with me who were able to pull me out of the water and get medical attention."" The injury in his spinal cord means he doesn't have any movement below his elbow, so he is missing the fine motor movement in his hands that would allow him to grasp or pick up objects. Burkhart's thoughts and brain signals work in the same way as they did before the accident, but his spinal cord injury means they never reach his hand, leaving him unable to move it. He has some residual movement in his shoulders, and can use those working shoulder muscles to move his arms about. ""That's how I do pretty much everything in my daily life when I'm not hooked up to the system,"" he says.

The system works by bypassing Burkhart's spinal cord injury. A device implanted in his brain records signals from neurons that fire when he thinks about a movement – picking up a cup, for example. This signal is passed to a computer that decodes it, and the resulting instruction is then sent to a sleeve he wears on his forearm that stimulates the muscles that move his wrist and fingers. In June 2014, in the early stages of the trial, Burkhart moved his hand again for the first time after his accident. ""It was a flicker of hope, knowing that this was something that was working, knowing I will be able to use my hand again,"" he said. After three sessions a week for over a year, he is able to use the system to do things he couldn't do on his own, like pick up a mug and pour its contents into another container, swipe a credit card, and play Guitar Hero.

So far he's been able to make isolated finger movements and six different hand and wrist movements. To test how useful this would be in a normal situation, the scientists had Burkhart pick up a container, empty its contents into a jar, then pick up a stick and stir the contents of the jar. It was a struggle at first, but by the end of the trial he was able to complete the action three out of five times in a 10-minute period.

The setup currently requires a 10–15-minute training period at the beginning of every session. Burkhart watches videos of different hand movements he's going to perform that day and thinks about the movements, so the computer learns what the brain signals for each movement looks like. ""The machine is actually learning, and Ian is learning how to refine his thought patterns,"" Chad Bouton, lead author on the paper, said in a press briefing. ""So the machine and the person are learning together, and after that 10–15-minute period there's a dramatic improvement, it's been really amazing to watch."" ""Initially, we'd do a short session and I'd feel completely mentally fatigued and exhausted,"" said Burkhart. ""But just like anything, with more and more practice it's become easier.""

""This technology is possible because there's about 50 years of basic neuroscience that has been looking at how signals in the brain encode information about movement,"" Dr Andrew Jackson, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University who was not involved with the work, told BuzzFeed News. ""What we're seeing now is all of that basic research which was driven by purely scientific questions coming to fruition in terms of enabling new treatments, but there's still a lot we need to learn."" There are still many challenges to be overcome to bring this work out of the lab and into the lives of the millions of people who are paralysed. ""We have to be realistic about this, there's still quite a long way towards turning this into something that would be feasible for widespread use in large numbers of people,"" Jackson said. For starters, the device that records the brain signals will need to be much smaller so it's fully implanted under the paralysed person's skin. ""One of the directions the field is moving towards,"" Jackson said, ""is to develop implanted devices that can be positioned under the skin and communicate wirelessly or route signals to the muscles completely under the skin.""

Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center/ Batelle Burkhart swipes a credit card during the study.

Our understanding of how brain signals change will also be crucial to making this technology usable on a large scale. ""The recordings we get from these electrodes in the brain can be quite unstable from day to day,"" Jackson said. That's why the device requires training every time Burkhart uses it. ""What we'd really like is a system that's plug and play and will work daily without needing to be recalibrated."" That could come from better electrode designs or looking for different signals that are more stable. Dr Jonas Zimmerman, a neuroscientist at Brown University in the US, who was also not involved with the study, echoed Jackson's point. ""Brain signals change from day to day (even hour to hour), the signals may be different depending on context (am I trying to lift a full or an empty glass, do I watch someone draw or do I want to draw myself), and brain signals change while we learn a new task,"" he told BuzzFeed news. ""We need to understand a lot more about the brain before we will make really meaningful improvements in this direction. ""It will be years until a paralyzed patient will be able to control neural prostheses independently from caregivers, but there is nothing that should make this improvement impossible.""",A Mind-Reading Computer Means This Paralysed Man Can Move His Hands Again,4,BuzzFeed

story_reviews_00458,"Pregnancy experts, including those at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend that most pregnant women get 30 minutes of exercise a day. If that feels a little onerous, consider new findings out of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston suggesting that love of physical activity may start in the womb.

So maybe women who won’t exercise for their own sake will do it for the baby.

The research in question involved mice, not women. A team led by Robert A. Waterland, an assistant professor of pediatrics, nutrition and molecular and human genetics, selected female mice that enjoyed running, according to a press release. (“Enjoyed”? Did they smile?) Half of them were put in cages with running wheels during pregnancy; the other half had no wheels.

The mice with running wheels voluntarily ran an average of more than six miles a night, decreasing to about two miles late in pregnancy. The offspring of those mothers turned out to be about 50 percent more physically active than those born to mothers that hadn’t had the exercise wheel option. And that difference persisted into mouse adulthood.

How does this relate to our own species?

Observational studies of active pregnant women and their babies have reported “results consistent with ours,” Waterland said. But in the human studies, it wasn’t always clear whether active mothers who have active children simply raised their kids to exercise a lot or whether there might have been a genetic predisposition to physical activity. The Baylor scientists were able to correct for those variables.

“Our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation,” Waterland said. “I think our results offer a very positive message. If expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies, I think they will be more motivated to get moving.”",Love of physical activity may start in the womb,2,Washington Post
story_reviews_00459,"A government panel of experts released updated guidelines today spelling out who should be taking a daily low-dose aspirin for heart health, which also offers the added benefit of protection against colorectal cancer.

Those who would benefit from the regimen, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, must meet a strict list of criteria -- including a high risk of heart disease and a low risk of bleeding side effects.

Specifically, the group recommends that adults 50 to 59 years old who have a 10 percent or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, are not at an increased risk for bleeding, and have a life expectancy of at least 10 years take a daily low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer.

""As with any drug, patients and their doctors must balance the benefits and risks of taking aspirin,"" Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of the task force and professor of medicine, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, told CBS News. ""The benefits of aspirin outweigh the harms for most people in their 50's who are at risk of cardiovascular disease but not at increased risk of bleeding. For people in this group, taking low-dose aspirin daily can help reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer.""

Adults in their 60s can also benefit from regular use of low-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher in this age group, so doctors should help these patients decide whether or not aspirin therapy is right for them on a case-by-case basis.

""The task force recommends that all patients talk to their doctor to evaluate their risk for cardiovascular disease and bleeding before making a decision about aspirin use, but this is particularly important for people in their 60s,"" Bibbins-Domingo said.

Heart disease and colorectal cancer are among the most common causes of death in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 610,000 Americans die of heart disease each year, accounting for 1 in 4 deaths. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women (excluding skin cancers) and a leading cause of cancer death, the American Cancer Society reports.

While taking low-dose aspirin daily can help prevent heart troubles, doctors note that it also increases the risk of bleeding in the stomach and intestines, and strokes caused by bleeding in the brain. The task force looked at the most up-to-date research on both the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of both heart disease and colorectal cancer to arrive at their recommendations.

When it comes to dosing, experts say sticking to a low-dose baby aspirin is best.

""The evidence shows that there's really no incremental benefit of going over 81 milligrams, and in fact, you may increase bleeding risk by going over,"" CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula, a cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told ""CBS This Morning"" when the draft guidelines were released last September.

At this time, the task force reports that more research is needed to assess whether taking aspirin is beneficial for people who are younger than 50 or those who are 70 and older.",Should you be taking daily low-dose aspirin for heart health?,4,CBS News
story_reviews_00460,"Individuals who have heart disease are often advised to take a low-dose aspirin every day to prevent blood clots that cause heart attacks and most strokes.

Some healthy men and women should take aspirin every day to ward off heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer. That’s the final recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) after more than a year of study and lively public comment. The recommendations were published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Aspirin has been used for more than 100 years to ease fever and relieve pain. Many people with heart disease are advised to take a low-dose aspirin every day to prevent blood clots, the cause of heart attacks and most strokes. That’s called secondary prevention. Whether healthy individuals should do the same thing, a strategy called primary prevention, is controversial.

The FDA is against taking aspirin for primary prevention, arguing that the risks, including bleeding in the brain and stomach, outweigh the benefits. The USPSTF recommends it for men and women aged 50 to 59 who are at risk of heart attack or stroke. The dueling recommendations kicked off a lively debate in the medical community.

Despite the clashing opinions, experts agree on two things: Aspirin should be just one part of an overall strategy to prevent heart attack and stroke that includes weight control, healthy eating, exercising, and not smoking. And don’t take aspirin without talking with your doctor.

Beyond that, here’s a sample of expert opinions.

Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Task force says some will benefit

Charles H. Hennekens: Balance between benefits and harms still hazy

Deepak L. Bhatt: No easy way to identify who will benefit or be harmed

Cynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Add personal preferences to the equation

Freek W.A. Verheugt: Even doctors are confused

By Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo: Taking aspirin is easy, but deciding whether or not to take aspirin for prevention is complex. Aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and colorectal cancer, but it also increases the risk of bleeding.

The US Preventive Services Task Force found that the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily clearly outweigh the harms for people who are 50 to 59 years old, who have increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and who are not at increased risk for bleeding. People who are 60 to 69 can also benefit from taking aspirin, but the risks for bleeding are higher in this age group. Some older individuals may be less likely to benefit from aspirin’s ability to prevent colorectal cancer because it takes about 10 years of daily aspirin for it to affect this risk.

It is important to note that this draft recommendation applies to people who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have at least a 10-year life expectancy, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily. Also, it is meant for people who do not already have cardiovascular disease.

Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, MD, is vice-chair of the US Preventive Services Task Force. She is also professor of medicine and of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.

By Charles H. Hennekens: After more than 25 years of research on aspirin for primary prevention, we are not much further along than we were after the landmark findings from the Physicians Health Study in 1988. We know that taking aspirin will prevent a first heart attack and a first stroke, but we also know that aspirin can cause serious bleeding, mainly in the gastrointestinal system and, more rarely, in the brain.

In a meta-analysis of the six major randomized trials of aspirin for primary prevention, among more than 95,000 participants, serious cardiovascular events occurred in 0.51 percent of participants taking aspirin and 0.57 percent of those not taking aspirin. That corresponds to a 20 percent relative reduction in risk. At the same time, serious bleeding events increased from 0.07 percent among non-aspirin takers to 0.10 percent among those taking aspirin, or a 40 percent relative increase in risk.

Although the totality of evidence is incomplete, it appears that aspirin has net benefits when the absolute 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular event is greater than 10 percent. Unfortunately, fewer than 5,000 of the trial participants have been in that risk category. (Individuals can calculate their 10-year risk using a relatively simple calculator from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute or a more complex one from the American Heart Association.)

These calculators don’t tell the whole story. Clinicians should evaluate additional risks and benefits. For example, some individuals are at higher risk of bleeding, such as those with a history of ulcers. Others are at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event because they are obese, physically inactive, or have a family history of such events.

Several ongoing trials will provide information on aspirin’s benefit-to-risk ratio. This information is essential for making rational guidelines for aspirin in primary prevention.

Charles H. Hennekens, MD, is professor of medicine at Florida Atlantic University. He was the principal investigator of the Physician’s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first heart attack in men, and the Women’s Health Study, which was the first to demonstrate that aspirin prevents a first stroke in women.

By Deepak L. Bhatt: The use of aspirin for primary prevention is one of the most complex issues in medicine today. That’s ironic because aspirin is ubiquitous and most patients perceive it to be safe and harmless. After all, it is sold over the counter.

Here’s the problem: The lower an individual’s risk of a future heart attack or ischemic stroke, the less he or she will benefit from taking daily low-dose aspirin. Yet the odds that aspirin will cause a problem, such as bleeding, remain relatively steady. That means for some low-risk individuals, taking daily aspirin could do more harm than good.

If there was a foolproof way to identify individuals at high risk for a future heart attack or stroke, as well as those at high risk for developing complications, we would know who should be taking aspirin for primary prevention and who should not. Unfortunately, no such tool exists.

Many patients — and many health care providers — believe that the aspirin-for-primary-prevention issue is settled. Not so. In fact, several clinical trials now underway are looking at this very question. These include the ASCEND, TIPS-3, and ASPREE trials.

The data on aspirin for preventing colorectal cancer are provocative, but are even less robust than for primary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Deepak L. Bhatt, MD, is executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

By Cynthia Boyd and Milo Puhan: Combining guidelines for the use of aspirin to prevent three different conditions — heart attack, stroke, and colorectal cancer — into a single recommendation makes good sense for patients. But making such recommendations is difficult because they must take into account so many factors.

Personal preferences are one very important factor. Say your mother had a disabling stroke, and you are willing to do everything you can to prevent having a stroke, even if it puts you at risk of bleeding. This might tip the balance in favor of taking aspirin. In contrast, someone who isn’t worried about having a cardiovascular event or developing colorectal cancer might want to stay away from aspirin to avoid bleeding.

With an international team of colleagues, we created an online tool that calculates whether the benefits of aspirin for primary prevention (preventing heart attack, ischemic stroke, and cancer) are greater than the harms (severe hemorrhagic stroke and severe gastrointestinal bleeds). The tool is based on research we recently published in BMC Medicine.

To use the tool, an individual enters his or her age group and sex and uses sliders to show how worried he or she is about six outcomes:

severe stroke

heart attack

severe gastrointestinal bleeding

very severe, severe, or moderately severe cancer

Green, orange, and red boxes represent the benefit-harm balance corresponding to the user’s information.

For now, this tool is for research purposes only. It must be verified before it is ready for prime time. But it suggests a direction for decision aids that can help individuals choose whether to adopt preventive strategies like aspirin that come with potentially harmful side effects.

Cynthia M. Boyd, MD, is associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Milo A. Puhan, MD, is director of the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute and professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Zurich.

By Freek W.A. Verheugt: Who should take aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or ischemic stroke is a complex issue — even for cardiologists. A recent report with data on 120 medical practices serving 69,000 patients found huge variation in doctors’ approaches. In some practices, 70 percent of patients were inappropriately taking aspirin. Part of my job, and that of other cardiologists and clinicians, is to help our patients make good choices about aspirin, guiding those at high risk toward aspirin use and those at low risk away from it.

It is important to keep in mind that other therapies, such as statins, have also been proven to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. These are often used in combination with aspirin. As I showed in a commentary in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when combined with a statin, aspirin’s net benefit in primary prevention is almost completely lost.

In a study by researchers from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and Loma Linda University, more than 700 older, healthy adults were asked to add either a handful of walnuts to their daily diets or to follow their normal diet without eating nuts.

After one year, both groups experienced minimal body weight, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol changes, but the walnut-eaters had significant reductions in LDL cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) compared to the nut-free control group.

The research shows the well-known cholesterol-lowering effect of eating walnuts works equally well in the elderly, even in the long term, the authors reported at the Experimental Biology conference in San Diego.

""Given walnuts are a high-energy food, a prevailing concern has been that their long-term consumption might be associated with weight gain,"" said study author Dr. Emilio Ros, director of the Lipid Clinic, Endocrinology & Nutrition Service at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, in a press statement. """"It's encouraging to see that eating walnuts may benefit this particular population.""

Other walnut studies presented at the conference, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, suggested the omega-3 fatty acid-rich nut may also benefit gut bacteria and help reduce inflammation.

Elisabetta Politi, nutrition director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University, said, ""We advocate that people eat nuts, including walnuts, because they are high in healthy fat, low in carbohydrates and a good source of protein.""

Politi said a serving of walnuts is about 14 halves, which adds up to 180 calories. They're rich in fiber, folic acid, and potassium. Walnuts are especially heart healthy because they have more polyunsaturated fat than almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, and macadamia nuts per serving. Walnut oil can be a good alternative too, in dressings and for light basting, Politi said.

It's still important to remember portion control, especially for people on weight loss programs, warned Politi.

story_reviews_00462,"(Reuters) - A stem cell therapy developed by Vericel Corp helped reduce deaths and hospitalizations in advanced heart failure patients, according to data from a midstage study, potentially providing a treatment that could delay the need for heart transplants.

However, the treatment failed to improve secondary goals of the trial, such as heart-pumping efficiency and six-minute walking distance, and Vericel shares fell more than 31 percent by afternoon trading on Monday.

“It’s a little baffling that you’re keeping patients alive, but not having any effect on those secondary endpoints,” said Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer. “People were looking for downside and they had one.”

The data compared Vericel’s bone marrow-derived ixmyelocel-T stem cells with placebo in 109 well-treated patients with advanced heart failure who had exhausted medical and device therapies.

After one year, the Vericel treatment led to a 37 percent reduction versus placebo in a composite of adverse events, including death, heart-related hospitalizations and unplanned clinic visits related to heart failure.

Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal.

The result was primarily driven by the difference in deaths of 13.7 percent in the placebo group, or 7 deaths, compared with 3.4 percent, or 2 deaths, for the ixmyelocel-T group. In addition, 38 percent of stem cell patients required hospitalization, versus 47 percent for placebo.

“This is strong evidence in a well-designed trial that we can decrease events,” said Dr. Timothy Henry, the study’s lead investigator and chief of cardiology at Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles. “For patients, this is a really hopeful thing.”

Henry, who presented the data at the ACC meeting, stressed the need for larger trials to prove the benefit of ixmyelocel-T

For the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing. They are then injected directly into the patient’s heart.

With advanced heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalizations, blood-pumping ability is diminished as the heart’s left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened.

If the disease worsens despite all available medicinal and interventional therapies, the only options are heart transplant or a pumping assist device.

“The idea is to find a treatment for this group of people before they get to that stage,” Henry said.

MONDAY, March 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture can help alleviate the often-debilitating hot flashes that afflict many breast cancer patients, new Italian research says.

Noting that hot flashes are a fact of life for many women with breast cancer, the investigators found that pairing lifestyle advice with weekly acupuncture sessions dramatically improved the women's quality of life.

""Acupuncture together with enhanced self-care for three months is effective in reducing hot flashes in women with breast cancer,"" said study author Giorgia Razzini, a clinical trial project manager in the oncology unit of Ospedale di Carpi (Carpi Hospital), in Bologna, Italy.

And because hormone treatment for breast cancer typically makes the hot flash experience even worse, Razzini added, acupuncture could be a useful tool for helping such patients ""stay on their therapy and improve their quality of life.""

Razzini and colleagues published their findings online March 28 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

In the study, the Italian team focused on 190 breast cancer patients who had reported moderate (or worse) hot flashes while undergoing treatment at five cancer hospitals and one primary health care center in northern Italy between 2010 and 2013.

The patients, whose average age was 49, were randomly split into two groups. One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.

The second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of ""traditional"" acupuncture.

All of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.

The result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.

Those in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.

So why does acupuncture seem to work?

Razzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.

Razzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, ""Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.""

Dr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.

""Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,"" she said.

""Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,"" Vito explained.

""And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,"" she added. ""But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work. Which, in the end, may help to encourage insurance companies to their expand coverage so this can become an affordable option for all patients in need.""

But there aren’t good ways to distinguish between mild blows that don’t require additional care and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could have more serious consequences. Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can’t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.

But in a study published in JAMA Neurology, scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.

They collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people’s symptoms.

In all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they’re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.

When Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.

“We don’t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don’t need them,” says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don’t experience any symptoms. “I don’t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.”

Testing for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.

MORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field

In the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan — the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don’t need one.

And because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don’t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they’re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they’re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.

“We may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,” she says.

story_reviews_00466,"The results of one of those studies are out Tuesday in JAMA. The study looks at adults with chronic low back pain, one of the leading cause of disabilities in the United States and one reason why more and more people are addicted to painkillers.

AD

Led by Daniel C. Cherkin of Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, the experiment involved randomly assigning 342 adults with the condition to meditate, talk with a psychologist or continue with their normal techniques for addressing the pain, such as medication. The first group engaged in yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which focuses on being aware of and accepting physical discomfort. The second group participated in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors during eight weekly two-hour group sessions.

AD

The participants in the small study ranged in age from 20 to 70 and had suffered from back pain for an average of 7.3 years.

The results for both techniques were very positive. At 26 weeks, 61 percent of those in the meditation group reported improvement in the activities they could do, compared with 58 percent in the CBT group and 44 percent of those who stuck to their usual routines. The results for pain improvement were similar, with 55 percent in the meditation group reporting improvement compared with 45 percent in the CBT group and 27 percent in the usual-care group. The numbers were similar when rechecked at 52 weeks.

AD

""These findings suggest that MBSR may be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic low back pain,"" the authors wrote.

The study did caution that 30 of the 103, or about one-third, of the participants in the meditation group reported an ""adverse event,"" most often an increase in pain due to yoga.

AD

In an editorial, Madhav Goyal and Jennifer A. Haythornthwaite of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that the mechanisms for why meditation might work on back pain is still a mystery but that this question is merely ""academic"" for many clinicians and their patients who need immediate relief.

The two wrote that despite this and other unknowns, the study provides ""a compelling argument for ensuring that an evidence-based health care system should provide access to affordable mind-body therapies.""

story_reviews_00467,"Despite considerable progress in prevention and treatment, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. When patients suffer from a heart attack or other cardiac event, it's critical that they get appropriate care and adopt lifestyle changes to prevent future damage.

Participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program has been proven to be particularly effective in helping patients recover and stay healthy. Research indicates that CR improves five-year mortality rates by 25 to 46 percent for patients following a heart attack or other cardiac event. In fact, CR has been given a Class 1A recommendation by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, making it a critical component of the standard of care.

In recent years, Intensive cardiac rehabilitation programs have been created as enhanced alternatives to ordinary CR. Patients and their physicians choose ICR programs over CR for at least three reasons: they are backed by published clinical evidence supporting their efficacy; they offer more complete education and exercise to improve patients' health; and they achieve greater patient adherence to the prescribed course of care.

ICR Programs Have Documented Results

Medicare covers both CR and ICR, but only ICR programs are required to meet specific efficacy standards. Each Medicare-approved ICR program must demonstrate through peer-reviewed published research that it has a positive impact on cardiac outcomes, such as decreasing the need for bypass surgery or stenting, and reduces specific risk factors for cardiovascular disease. One of the Medicare-approved programs, Pritikin ICR, is based on a lifestyle change program that has more than 100 peer-reviewed studies validating its effectiveness, including significantly reducing levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, body mass index and blood pressure, as well as reducing risk factors for diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer and other comorbidities. R. James Barnard, Ph.D., a researcher at the University of California–Los Angeles and a co-author of many of these studies, says, ""These studies have consistently shown the value of a more comprehensive approach to health – combining exercise with proper nutrition and a healthy mindset – at preventing, controlling or reversing common diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, and have proven the long-term sustainability of these lifestyle changes."" When physicians refer their cardiac patients to an ICR program, they can have confidence knowing that the program has been proven to be effective.

ICR Offers More In-Depth Education on Lifestyle Change

In practice, ordinary CR is undertaken in a series of up to 36 individual sessions, and patients typically spend most of that time on exercise rather than education and counseling to modify cardiac risk factors. In contrast, Medicare covers 72 sessions of ICR, allowing patients to supplement the exercise portion of ordinary CR with an in-depth education about the relationship between lifestyle and cardiovascular health. Each day of ICR includes both an exercise class and at least one class with practical lessons on how to make better nutrition choices, manage stress, stop smoking or maintain a positive attitude. This type of education is crucial for many patients to recover from a cardiovascular event and optimize their health going forward.

Dr. Albert Krause, cardiac rehab medical director at CHRISTUS Health in Shreveport-Bossier, Louisiana, said that ICR ""allows hospitals to provide cardiac patients with a comprehensive education about critical lifestyle changes following a heart attack or other cardiac event. It is an essential component of our continuum of care, complementing the surgical and medical treatments we offer, to improve patients' long-term outcomes.""

ICR Achieves Better Patient Engagement

ICR programs also have improved patient engagement compared to ordinary CR. A study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that only 62 percent of eligible cardiac patients are referred by their physician to a CR program, and only one-third of those patients actually attend the program. These patients attend an average of 20 to 24 sessions of ordinary CR, despite being prescribed up to 36 sessions. In comparison, a review of a sample of hospitals that recently implemented ICR programs all experienced a significantly higher level of patient adherence to the prescribed course of rehabilitation. Most of these hospitals averaged over 48 sessions per patient in the second half of 2015 – over double the industry average for ordinary CR.

As Dr. John Harvey, president and medical director of Oklahoma Heart Hospital, says: Patients report high levels of satisfaction with ICR and feel encouraged to stick with the program and adopt a heart healthy lifestyle.""",The Benefits of Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Over Ordinary Cardiac Rehabilitation,3,U.S. News & World Report
story_reviews_00468,"Broccoli has been linked to a growing list of health benefits, such as a reduced risk of cancer and osteoporosis. New research suggests consuming broccoli could also slow or reverse blood-vessel damage and atherosclerosis due to high cholesterol.

The study, in Experimental Biology and Medicine, found that a high-cholesterol diet combined with supplements containing sulforaphane, a natural compound in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, significantly reduced levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, in rabbits, compared with a high-fat diet without the supplements. Sulforaphane-fed rabbits also had higher levels of good cholesterol and improved blood-vessel function.

Previous studies showed that sulforaphane can reduce inflammation in cultured vascular cells, but its effects on atherosclerosis hadn’t been studied directly, the researchers said. Sulforaphane has an “extraordinary” ability to trigger multiple enzymes that protect against oxidative or environmental stress and reduce inflammation, they suggest. The study, at Mansoura University in Egypt, involved three groups of five rabbits. Two of the groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet for four weeks, including one group that also received daily supplements of sulforaphane orally in a sodium solution. A control group got a normal diet without sulforaphane. Treatment with sulforaphane decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL by 43%, 70% and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet. Sulforaphane treatment also enhanced levels of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol, above normal, according to the study. The cholesterol ratio, an indication of heart-disease risk, was close to control levels in sulforaphane-treated animals, the study said. After four weeks, CRP, or C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, significantly decreased in suforaphane-treated rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet compared with rabbits on the same diet that didn’t get the supplement. CRP levels in sulforaphane-treated rabbits were almost at control levels. Blood vessels from rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet were atrophied and inflamed. There was mild vessel swelling in sulforaphane-treated rabbits, while control rabbits had normal vessels. Caveat: Sulforaphane hasn’t been tested on people with high cholesterol. The equivalent quantity of broccoli in humans wasn’t mentioned. Sulforaphane attenuates the development of atherosclerosis and improves endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic rabbits

For cigarette smokers who waver at the edge of a decision to quit and consider strategies to ease the transition, a new study finds that the all-in approach is more likely to work than wading in slowly.

In a clinical trial that pitted would-be quitters who stopped smoking altogether on quit day against those directed to wean themselves off the butts over two weeks, researchers found that those who went cold turkey were more likely than gradual taperers to succeed in quitting for four weeks and for six months.

The differences weren’t overwhelming: at four weeks, 39.2% of the gradualists were no longer smoking, compared to 49% of the do-it-nowers. At six months 15.5% of the gradualists and 22% of those who stopped smoking on quit day were “former smokers.” But in a group of this size, those differences are considered statistical proof that quitting abruptly is a superior strategy to tiptoeing into the decision.

The study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday.

Those numbers also underscore a somewhat depressing truth among cigarette smokers wishing to quit: Failure is common. Most studies have shown that roughly one-in-four quitters who use medicines to aid in their effort is able to remain abstinent for six months, and many who make it that far subsequently relapse. Successful quitters tend to have one thing in common: Most of them tried to quit many times before succeeding.

The study was conducted in Great Britain, where participants included 697 people who smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day or who had diminished lung capacity consistent with regular smoking. To participate, subjects had to agree to quit within two weeks of enrollment. They were then assigned to either an abrupt-quit or gradual-quit group.

Enrollees in the gradual-quit group did get to choose whether, in the two-week period over which they were to stop smoking, they would taper their daily cigarettes, observe smoke-free periods, or smoke on a schedule. While they followed those gradual-quit patterns, they wore nicotine patches and got fast-acting nicotine products, including gum, tablets, lozenges and sprays.

At a nurse visit one week before their final-quit day, the gradualists had reduced their cigarette consumption, on average, by 48% -- just short of the 50% goal. By quit-day, they had reduced on average by 68% (short of the 75% goal).

Advertisement

The abrupt-quitters were issued nicotine patches, which they wore for the two weeks leading up to their “quit day.” After that, they were issued nicotine-replacement products to ease their withdrawal. And despite being told not to alter their smoking patterns as their quit-day approached, they did decrease their smoking by an average of 29%.

After the two-week period was up and cessation began in both conditions, both groups experienced withdrawal symptoms and urge intensities that were roughly the same.

The provision not only of nicotine-replacement products but of schedules, structure and professional encouragement for gradual quitters likely “optimized” those participants’ likelihood of success, the researchers said. And yet, their success rates still fell well below those of abrupt-quitters.

The latest finding falls in line with other research on quitting. It may be that those who choose to quit gradually are not as committed to quitting as are those willing to take the plunge, but since participants here were randomized to their condition, this study suggests that different levels of motivation might not fully explain the different rates of success.

The researchers acknowledge that this is hardly the last word on the best way to quit. In a large population of smokers, the gradual approach might feel kinder and gentler to many smokers, and prompt more to attempt quitting more often. Quitting gradually is, at least, sometimes successful. So, over time and in a large population, getting more people to try might result in greater reductions in smoking than abrupt quitting, they acknowledge.

Here’s what the American Cancer Society says about quitting, and the often-discouraging statistics:

“The truth is that quit smoking programs, like other programs that treat addictions, often have fairly low success rates. But that doesn’t mean they’re not worthwhile or that you should be discouraged. Your own success in quitting and staying that way is what really counts, and you have some control over that. Even if you don’t succeed the first few times, keep trying. You can learn from your mistakes so that you’ll be ready for those pitfalls next time.

story_reviews_00470,"No-Drill Dentistry: Fluoride Treatments Can Prevent Cavities In Adults

Enlarge this image Vidhya Nagarajan for NPR Vidhya Nagarajan for NPR

If the high-pitched whir of a dentist's drill as it bores into your molar terrifies you, good news! There could be fewer fillings in your future. A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction.

""OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth,"" says Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard practice for children's teeth, but Manski's patient, Alice Clash, is 91 years old. Like many older patients, Clash is taking medications that cause dry mouth, which puts her at high risk for cavities.

So Manski takes a skinny brush and a little pot of yellowish liquid and paints the varnish on Clash's teeth. ""We know that saliva helps us wash away bacteria and food in the mouth,"" Manski says. ""The fluoride varnish will help that.""

One way fluoride helps is by seeping into the enamel and drawing the calcium and phosphate that's naturally present in the saliva. The minerals boost the teeth's natural healing process and make them more resistant to future decay. But there are other theories about how fluoride works. It strengthens the enamel before the tooth erupts, which is why it's so important for children. And it attacks the acid-producing bacteria in the mouth. One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.

It takes about a minute, and the fluoride treatment is done. Some patients are also given a prescription for a concentrated fluoride gel that can be used at night.

""These preventative approaches work on adults just as well as they do on children,"" says Norman Tinanoff, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Maryland. He says part of what's making fluoride treatments popular for adults is a move to make dental care personal, with an individual treatment plan for each patient. To do that, you have to weigh a patient's risk of getting cavities.

One of the biggest proponents of this approach is John Featherstone, dean of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, and looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked.

""It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,"" Featherstone says. ""Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth."" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities. These guys feed on sugars and expel acid that eats away at the enamel.

Traditionally, dentists were taught that the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. Featherstone saw another way. ""It's a little bit like your car is starting to rust,"" he says. ""If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you're in good shape.""

Like rust, tooth decay is a slow process. A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels.

""In the past we believed tooth decay was a rapidly progressive disease. But research shows it's slowly progressive,"" says Wendell Evans, associate professor of dentistry at the University of Sydney in Australia. He recently published a study that found using these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.

Striking as these results seem, the concept isn't new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. ""Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,"" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.

""Prevention has always been a part of the world of dentistry,"" says Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Education Association. ""What we're seeing is a generational shift,"" Valachovic says. As dentists have come to better understand the microbiology of the mouth, more effective preventive techniques have followed.

But cost has been an issue. Insurance companies routinely pay for fluoride treatments for children, but not so much for adults. The National Association of Dental Plans couldn't give a definitive answer about coverage, but calls to some individual carriers and dental offices suggest it depends entirely on the type of plan you have. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any. If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association.

Cost could also be a factor for dentists. Featherstone and Wendell say some dentists may be reluctant to embrace the preventive methods because they worry they'll lose money if they they do fewer costly procedures.

At this point, Featherstone says, two-thirds of dental schools in the U.S. teach some kind of disease management model based on a thorough risk assessment. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.

""It will happen,"" Featherstone says. ""It's just a matter of time.""",No-Drill Dentistry: Fluoride Treatments Can Prevent Cavities In Adults,4,NPR
story_reviews_00471,"America’s ongoing battle with weight-loss that has led to fad diets and invasive surgeries like gastric bypass and stomach stapling. Now, there is a new solution for people with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 that want to lose weight called the Orbera gastric balloon.

Dr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. It is then inflated with saline during the procedure that lasts about 45 minutes. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation. The balloon remains in the patient’s stomach for six months and is then removed the same way it was inserted, through the mouth.

“The beauty of the procedure is that it is a nonsurgical procedure,” Chattoo said. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster.

The objective of the Orbera system is the make the patient feel partially satiated so they eat smaller, but more nutritious portions. Chattoo also offers patients a nutritionist and trainer with the procedure. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry.

Marie Brown chose to undergo the procedure and credits Orbera for helping her lose over 20 pounds in three and a half months. She told FoxNews.com that the balloon “makes you feel full all the time to the point where you’re not angry about having to lose things like chocolate and cake.”

Brown said that the balloon acted like a “restart button” and retrained her body to adapt to a new lifestyle of healthy eating and exercise.

Orbera is not for the morbidly obese or those who have had surgical procedures affecting the stomach or intestinal lining. It is meant for people looking for an extra jumpstart on a diet, whether the purpose is cosmetic or for health reasons.

“We might be able to prevent young, healthy people from having these chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension,” Chattoo said.

The most common side effect of installing the balloon is nausea that lasts a few days. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient. The balloon would be removed in the same way it is at the six month mark.

Orbera is not covered by insurance and costs $8,000. For more information, click here.

story_reviews_00472,"A new form of cataract surgery using a patient's stem cells has restored vision in babies for the first time, and someday the technique may hold promise for millions of older Americans who undergo traditional cataract eye surgery every year, say scientists who developed the new procedure.

Eye experts across the country who spoke with CBS News are alternately excited and cautious about the findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature.

The procedure, developed by researchers at the University of California San Diego and China, is less invasive than traditional cataract treatment, said the scientists.

Cataracts are most common in older adults. As most people age, an opaque film slowly forms over the lens -- the part of the eye that helps with focusing on images at various distances. It clouds vision and can lead to blindness.

In cataract surgery, which has been around for several decades, eye surgeons make an incision in the front of the eye and remove the lens from its supporting capsule. Then they replace it with an artificial lens.

The new procedure described in Nature involves making a slim incision at the side of the lens capsule, removing the entire lens, yet preserving the empty capsule bag or ""scaffold."" A certain kind of stem cell, called endogenous stem/progenitor cells, when left intact, then begins to repopulate the damaged lens and essentially grow a new, healthy lens.

Study author Dr. Kang Zhang, the chief of ophthalmic genetics at UC San Diego's Shiley Eye Institute, told CBS News, ""Unlike [the] current way of cataract surgery, which destroys over half of lens stem cells and requires implantation of a plastic intranet ocular lens, we devised a new surgery to make a very small opening at the side of a cataractous lens bag, remove [the] cataract inside, allow the opening to heal, and promote dormant lens stem cells to regrow an entirely new lens with vision.""

Pioneering surgery tested in babies

The experimental procedure was done in 12 infants who were born with a congenital cataract condition.

By using a less invasive procedure, Zhang and his colleagues report that they were able to leave the lens epithelial stem cells, also called LECs, intact. These LECs regenerated the eye's lens in the children, eliminating the need for implants. The same technique was also successfully performed in animals.

In little ones with congenital cataracts, eye surgeons need to intervene early so that light can get to the brain and allow for normal, healthy growth, said Suraj Bhat, associate professor of ophthalmology and director of the Vision Molecular Biology Laboratory at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute. Bhat was not involved in the new research, but said it's ""extremely exciting"" because it offers an alternative to ""an extraordinarily invasive"" procedure.

""In early childhood cataracts are very bad. We need light to enter into the eyes at a young age to get proper brain function, otherwise, information does not get transferred to the developing brain,"" said Bhat.

Artificial irises let people see in a different light

Traditional surgery can cause opacity in the line of a child's vision and, because the eye is still growing, it is difficult to provide good vision with eye glasses, explained Julie T. Daniels, from University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, in an accompanying commentary in Nature.

Many children also later go on to suffer from glaucoma.

Daniels wrote that to correctly refract light onto the retina at the back of the eye, the cornea and lens must remain transparent throughout life. Current treatments for the cornea and lens involve donor transplants or artificial implants, but the procedures can be risky. She said the new procedure, which coaxes stem cells to regenerate normal tissue in the body, offers promise.

""The study's stem cell engineering has led to the regeneration of transparent lens tissue in children, showing that the concept offers a potential therapeutic approach,"" Daniels wrote.

She noted a second study in Nature that used transplant tissue grown in the laboratory from stem cells to treat damaged corneas, saying it also holds promise.

Zhang said their results need to be validated in a large number of patients ""and with a longer follow-up period.""

Will it work in older eyes?

One major question remains to be answered: Can it be applied to age-related cataracts, the leading cause of blindness?

According to the National Eye Institute, about 24.4 million Americans suffer from cataracts. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of cataract cases in the U.S. went up by 20 percent, and it's expected to continue to grow as the population ages.

""We are now planning a study to test this approach in this old patient population. In addition, we are testing if this approach can be used in treating other leading causes of blindness, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma,"" said Zhang.

He hopes the surgery will be available to the general population within four to five years.

""I would anticipate that it may be available after several independent studies with a large number of patients,"" he said.

Some other experts in the field saw great promise in the research.

""Everyone's working on this. Stem cells are like the Holy Grail of vision research,"" Dr. James Tsai, M.D., president of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, told CBS News. ""To me, it's very exciting data. They may be on to something.""

But he tempered the hope the study offers by noting that the lens regeneration work is also ""very controversial"" and could impact a multimillion-dollar industry.

""This is potentially a new surgery. If you think about the implications in the long run, lens implants may not be necessary,"" he said. ""There are a lot of doctors who will want to see more data.""

He also pointed out that the study involved infants, and that adults -- the most common cataract patients -- have a different regenerative capacity of lens epithelial stem cells.

In the meantime, Tsai said it's hopeful news for some babies with congenital cataracts like the children who participated in the study. ""As a glaucoma specialist, the way we do congenital cataracts, there's a great risk these babies will develop glaucoma for a lifetime and maybe with this new surgery, they won't have that glaucoma risk.""

Dr. Maria Valeria Canto-Soler, assistant professor of ophthalmology and director of the Retinal Degeneration Research Center at Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said she was impressed by the research.

""The main excitement for me is the ability to regenerate an organ or a tissue within an organ,"" said Canto-Soler, a retina specialist.

""From what I know, I'd say this is the first demonstration where you can use endogenous stem cells for replacing tissue within the eye. It's something we are all looking for. They have actually done it in humans.""

She said, even without answers to the question of whether it will work in aging eyes, it creates hope for children with congenital issues. ""If you can create it in children, that's a big thing. You are giving sight back to little kids and that change their lives.""

Larger studies, ""more eyes"" needed

Dr. Kathryn Hatch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston, told CBS News the procedure ""seems very exciting,"" but more research is needed.

""I'd need to see a larger study with more eyes, and we need to see some reproducibility, and see how long it would take for the lens -- if it's able to regenerate -- what are the visual results. Because that's what patients really care about. Their vision. If it takes months to get to an outcome, it's not superior to the lens technologies we have now. I'm not sure what the advantage is. Most patients don't even want to wait. They want to get back to work, their life,"" Hatch added.

She also had questions about how the procedure was done with such a tiny incision. ""I don't understand how they're doing the surgery with such a tiny hole without tearing the capsule. If we make a three millimeter incision [in traditional cataract surgery], that's really small in an adult.""

Cataract surgery is ""traditionally done by hand with a bent needle. That's one of the most difficult steps to learn as a surgeon. One of most important steps to learn,"" she said and there could be major eye damage if a surgery was compromised by a tear.

She also noted that baby eye surgery is different from adults in that the infant cataract is much softer compared to an adult's harder cataract.

UCLA's Bhat noted another limitation in the study: ""These are all genetic cataracts. This study wasn't long enough. They [cataracts] may come back,"" he said, but it's also possible the genetic defect may not reappear.

He's said it's unclear if the results will be mirrored in older cataract patients, the same concern expressed by others in the field.

""Cell division is slower in older people,"" Bhat said. ""The biggest problem as we grow older, particularly beyond 50, is cell division which keeps on decreasing. Our ability to make new cells is significantly lost. The process that these people are depending upon is tremendously dependent on cell division.""

Bhat said he also paused when he read the statement in the paper that claimed a 100 percent success rate three months after surgery.

story_reviews_00473,"While breathing fresh, clean air can boost productivity, sleep and overall health, not everyone can live in the great outdoors and it’s difficult to know just how clean the indoor air in your home or office is.

Since most people spend about 90 percent of their time inside, having poor indoor air quality could affect your health and the health of your family members—especially during winter.

“Low dry humidity in the winter can make asthma worse and children who have dried mucosa can acquire some nasal infections easier,” Dr. Robert G. Lahita, chairman of medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. “Heating ducts that have mold and spores in them can make respiratory symptoms worse in the winter when hot air is blowing through them. Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”

Different sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said.

“In the winter the biggest issue is carbon monoxide poisoning, with emergency medical services we see a few of these every year-- it is from faulty heaters, cooking without ventilation or fireplaces,” he said.

Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality.

Awair is the first smart air quality device that monitors, analyzes and provides feedback to improve the air you breathe. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality.

“The goal for the user is to keep five green dots. As soon as you see other colored (amber and red) dots show up on top of the green dots, your environment is getting off the healthy ranges whether it being temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, and dust,” Ronald Ro, the CEO and co-founder of Bitfinder Inc., the makers of Awair, told FoxNews.com.

Based on your air score, the monitoring gadget will send personalized alerts and advice to the user via its corresponding Awair mobile app. When air conditions are harmful, like when a bedroom has a high carbon dioxide level, it will send a notification to the user and advise them to open up a window through the app. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.

If you already have a smart device system for your home, Awair is working on partnerships with several connected devices like Nest thermostat and other smart appliances so you can manage the air quality in your home or office when you're not there.

The Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars.

story_reviews_00474,"(CNN) How much -- or how little -- you eat could influence how long you live.

The idea of caloric control improving your health, and therefore your lifespan, is nothing new, but researchers are now hoping to accurately determine the type of diet that could make you live longer.

One team at the University of Southern California ( USC) are reducing the calorie count as low as it can go, using specific foods to trick the human body into thinking it's fasting -- a process called fasting mimicry.

""Diet can have a remarkable effect on you,"" says Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology at USC Davis, who has been long been researching the mechanisms behind human aging and has recently turned his attention to fasting.

""It can reprogram your body and put it on a path to live longer,"" says Longo.

Shutdown and regeneration

Fasting has been performed by communities and cultures for millennia and Longo's team are curious about the advantages.

Their idea follows on from the long running trend of caloric restriction, mostly known through diets such as the 5-2 diet and intermittent fasting. Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it's in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.

""As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,"" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.

When cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body's reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. ""You're killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.""

Starvation strategies

In a 2015 study , Longo's team set a specific diet for human volunteers, which mimicked the effects of fasting over five consecutive days monthly, for three months. Trials were also conducted in mice.

People consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn't determine the benefit.

""It's not just about reducing calories"", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.

""The human fasting mimicking diet (FMD) program is a plant based diet program designed to attain fasting-like effects while providing micronutrient nourishment (vitamins, minerals, etc.) and minimize the burden of fasting,"" Longo said in the study

After three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.

""The diet is turning on the body's ability to renew itself,"" says Longo.

The team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.

How does it work?

""When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],"" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.

This activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. ""You won't activate the correct pathways,"" says Longo.

""When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.

According to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that ""some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached"". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.

""Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins"" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. ""Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,"" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.

Is it safe?

Unlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo's diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.

""Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,"" says Longo.

More work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team.

""The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area,"" says Toribio-Mateas.",Occasional fasting could help you live longer,3,CNN
story_reviews_00475,"(CNN) A new review of the ""little pink pill"" for women with low sexual desire says the drug doesn't work very well -- but some doctors and patients who've been using the treatment disagree. The drug, Addyi, or flibanserin , has been on the market since October.

""The data presented in this review suggests that the meaningful change caused by flibanserin is minimal,"" according to the team of Dutch researchers.

The researchers looked at eight studies on Addyi that together included nearly 6,000 women. They said for women using the drug, the number of additional ""satisfying sexual events"" averaged out to about 0.5 per month.

The agency asked Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which makes Addyi, to do more studies on the interaction between Addyi and alcohol.

The researchers said the drug had significant known side effects, such as dizziness, sleepiness, and nausea.

The FDA approved Addyi last August with a ""black box warning"" to highlight the risks of severe low blood pressure and fainting when patients drink alcohol, take certain drugs, or have liver problems.

'I was amazed'

Some doctors and patients who've been using Addyi say the drug has been helpful. There are no other FDA-approved treatments for women suffering from low sexual desire.

Dr. Lauren Streicher, medical director of the Center for Sexual Medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the results cited in the Dutch study are averages, and while Addyi doesn't work for everyone, many of her patients have benefited from it.

She says she's written Addyi prescriptions for about 10 women, and three or four have emailed her back to say it's worked. ""They say, 'Oh my God, this has changed my life. Things are wonderful,'"" Streicher said.

Jodi Cole, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother from Porter, Oklahoma, said before she started taking Addyi, she didn't want to have sex with her husband, Matt. ""I love my husband and I believe God created emotional and sexual intimacy as key components of marriage. So we had sex, usually a couple of times a week. And while I was willing, part of me dreaded it. Every time,"" Cole wrote in an email to CNN.

Cole said she started taking Addyi in November, and within six weeks felt a difference. ""I was amazed,"" she wrote. ""I actually enjoyed being intimate and for the first time in a long time felt that connection with Matt.""

She said for her it wasn't about increasing the quantity of sex she was having, but rather the quality. ""What (Addyi) does is give just enough support so I can think about that part of our relationship with anticipation of pleasure rather than anxiety,"" she wrote. She understands Addyi can have side effects, but said women should be able to choose to take it just as men choose to take Viagra despite its side effects.

""I should be able to choose whether the side effects are worth the benefit,"" she wrote.

The controversy over Addyi

Seldom has one pill raised such controversy among medical professionals.

Doctors who treat women with low libidos tore apart the JAMA study. Streicher, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said the study drew ""erroneous conclusions.""

The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health went even further, calling the study ""a great disservice to the millions of pre-menopausal women suffering from (hypoactive sexual desire disorder).""

The doctors had several problems with the study's methodology, including that three of the eight studies the Dutch researchers analyzed were not published. When studies are published, they go through a peer review process to assess whether the study methodology is sound.

One of those studies used a dosage of the drug that was half as high as what the FDA approved.

Dr. Loes Jasper, one of the authors of the Dutch analysis, said she and her colleagues removed the results from that study and still found that Addyi's affects were minimal.

She said she and her colleagues included the results of the unpublished studies because sometimes negative studies of a drug don't get published.

""We included all published and unpublished studies to capture a complete overview of the benefits and risks of flibanserin, without bias,"" Jaspers wrote in an email to CNN.

According to the FDA, which looked at three clinical trials of Addyi that included about 2,400 women, about 10% more patients treated with Addyi reported meaningful improvements in satisfying sexual events, sexual desire, or reduced distress compared to women taking a placebo.

In their editorial, Woloshine and Schwartz said Sprout and others put pressure on FDA to approve the drug.

story_reviews_00476,"An ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the site of pain, at a consistent dose for up to 24 hours, has been developed by UK researchers.

Scientists at the University of Warwick and spin-off company Medherant say their TEPI patch could revolutionize the transdermal drug delivery market.

University of Warwick research chemist Professor David Haddleton told Reuters that the polymer matrix in the patch acts as a reservoir for the drug, capable of releasing between five and ten times the amount of drugs used in gels and patches currently on the market, for periods of six hours, 12 hours, and even 24 hours.

“What we do is dissolve the active ibuprofen, for example, into the adhesive so we can have quite a high loading - so up to 30 percent of the adhesive will be the ibuprofen,” said Haddleton. “When that’s placed on the skin just like an elastoplast then the drug will actually diffuse across the skin into the body at the site of the pain and then relieve the pain in the same way as current gels and creams. We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”

The patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.

Although TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.

According to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, “we’ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we’ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We’ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we’ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we’ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.”

The team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.

Haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. “What’s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we’re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,” he said.

Lee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.

“One of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven’t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,” said Lee.

The TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik. Lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants, helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis, and repetitive strain injuries. Nutrition companies have also shown an interest in adapting Medherant’s technology for transmitting minerals and vitamins through the skin.",Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future,3,Harms of medical treatment
story_reviews_00477,"Two groups of scientists presented results at an HIV conference on Monday suggesting that a vaginal ring could prevent HIV transmission in women. In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.

The ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.

Looking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.

The other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.

These age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.

“If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don’t know that yet,” Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.

Adherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.

The ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.

“A prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,” Baeten said. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.

“There is absolute reason to celebrate. But 27% is a lower number than any of us would like to see,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News.

“We obviously always want higher numbers. But 1 in 3 infections were prevented overall — and that’s huge.”

Warren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed, as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection, against not only HIV but pregnancy.

Like birth control, the more types of HIV prevention, the better, experts say.

“For some women, a pill every day might work really well. For others, that may be not achievable,” Baeten said. “Pills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options.”","A Vaginal Ring Could Prevent HIV, Two Huge Studies Just Found",3,BuzzFeed
story_reviews_00478,"Use of osteoporosis drugs, once heavily advertised by celebrity spokeswomen, has dropped by more than 50% in recent years amid reports of such serious side effects as sudden bone fractures.

Yet many experts say the benefits of the drugs, known as bisphosphonates, far outweigh the risks for many users.

An analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine last month estimated that for every 1,000 women with osteoporosis treated up to five years, bisphosphonates prevented 100 fractures and caused at most 1.

“Used by the right women, in the right way, they have big advantages. I would hate to see those advantages lost,” says the lead author Dennis Black, a University of California, San Francisco epidemiologist who led the clinical trials for two bisphosphonates, Fosamax and Reclast, and continues to consult for companies that make osteoporosis drugs.

Related Reading A Support Group of Women

“Bisphosphonates are absolutely effective,” says Timothy Bhattacharyya, an orthopedic trauma surgeon and head of osteoporosis research at the National Institutes of Health. But Dr. Bhattacharyya, who doesn’t receive financial support from osteoporosis drug makers, says “it makes sense to wait until you have a diagnosis of osteoporosis, and not take the drugs for more than five years.”

Some critics say the new analysis overestimates the benefits and underestimate the number of sudden thigh-bone fractures, which can be coded as regular hip fractures in medical records.

Osteoporosis occurs when bone, which is constantly being replenished, breaks down faster than it gets replaced, leaving the skeleton porous and brittle. Each year in the U.S., osteoporosis causes some 700,000 spinal fractures and 300,000 hip fractures, a leading cause of nursing-home admissions. Women, who lose bone rapidly at menopause, are far more susceptible than men. An estimated 50% of women and 25% of men over age 50 will suffer an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetime.

Bisphosonates slow the breakdown and resorption of bone. But who to treat and for how long has been contentious for years—particularly as word of the unusual fractures has spread.

The incidence of hip fractures has dropped by about 30% since 1995 when Fosamax, the first bisphosphonate, went on sale in the U.S. But curiously, the decline in hip fractures has continued, even with fewer Americans taking the drugs in recent years.

There are many possible explanations: fewer Americans are smoking (which hastens bone loss); more are exercising (which helps build bone) and more are obese (which helps guard against fractures. “People have more padding,” Dr. Black says.)

Prescribing patterns have also changed. Many doctors now counsel patients to stop taking bisphosphonates after three to five years and re-evaluate the need. Studies show there may be little added benefit in longer-term use.

And many doctors now prescribe the drugs mainly to women who already have osteoporosis rather than the estimated 30 million postmenopausal women with “osteopenia,” or only slightly reduced bone mass, who were targeted in early ad campaigns.

“We’re trying to move away from the word ‘osteopenia.’ It isn’t a disease. It merely tells us that bone density is in the lower part of normal range. There are an awful lot of people who fall into that category who may never get osteoporosis,” says Robert Lindsay, chief of medicine at Helen Hayes Hospital in West Haverstraw, N.Y. He has received lecture fees from two osteoporosis drug makers.

Many of the women who suffered sudden thigh fractures were relatively young and had taken bisphosphonates for years for osteopenia.

Jennifer Schneider, a Tucson, Ariz., physician, was 59 years old and had taken bisphosphonates for seven years when her thigh bone suddenly snapped on the subway while visiting New York City in 200.X-rays showed her femur—usually one of the strongest bones in the body—had broken in two just below the hip. Surgeons inserted a titanium rod to hold the bone together, but the fracture was slow to heal and required a second surgery.

In a published study of 81 cases, Dr. Schneider found that, after the first fracture, 40% of the women suffered a similar break in the other leg within two years, and 35% had delayed healing.

One theory is that prolonged use of the drugs may slow the turnover of bone too much in some people, leaving it unusually brittle. Estimates of how common these fracture are range from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 500 among women who have used bisphosphonates for five years or more.

Dr. Schneider, who has formed a support group of fellow fracture sufferers, has testified before the Food and Drug Administration, asking for stronger warnings about the drugs. She also says some doctors are continuing to prescribe bisphosphonates for too long.

Another severe side effect, osteonecrosis of the jaw, in which sections of jaw bone deteriorate after dental work and don’t heal, is estimated to occur in less than 1 per 10,000 patients taking bisphosphonates for osteoporosis.

Some dentists now suggest that women contemplating invasive dental work have it done before they start taking bisphosphonates, but the American Dental Association has not made a formal recommendation.

Makers of bisphosphonates say there is no definitive proof that bisphosphonates cause either atypical femur fractures or jaw bone deterioration.

For its part, the FDA has told doctors and patients to be aware of the potential for typical femur fractures and jaw problems and urged caution about long-term use of the drugs, but has not issued specific recommendations about when to stop or for how long.

Still, consensus is emerging among researchers and bone experts on other points.

Women should have a baseline bone density scan at least by age 65, and earlier if they have a strong family history of osteoporosis and other risk factors. A score of minus 2.5 indicates osteoporosis, but treatment should not be based on that alone, doctors now say.

An online tool, known as FRAX, for Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, developed by the World Health Organization, takes into account other factors such as a patient’s age, gender, weight, height, smoking, alcohol consumption and parental hip fractures. It computes the chances of suffering a major bone fracture in the next 10 years. The National Osteoporosis Foundation says if the risk is more than 3% for a hip fracture or 20% for other major fractures, the advantages of treatment outweigh the risks.

Bisphosphonates are still the first line of treatment for osteoporosis. Other osteoporosis drugs have different trade-offs.

All the bisphosphonates are now available in generic form, for as little as $5 a month. Newer osteoporosis drugs retailing for hundreds of dollars or more a month include Forteo (teriparatide) and Prolia (denosumab).

Doctors continue to recommend 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium, 600 to 800 IUs of vitamin D and at least 30 minutes of weight-bearing exercise, three times a week. Whether that alone is sufficient to prevent osteoporosis in some patients isn’t clear, but some think it’s the safest course.

Pat Sullivan, a 62-year old retired teacher in Delaware, Ohio, was told she had osteopenia six years ago. Increasing her calcium and vitamin D intake and exercising more, she was able to improve her bone-density score temporarily. Then, she began to be less diligent and another bone scan two months ago showed full osteoporosis in her spine.

Her doctor wants her to begin treatment—two years of Forteo to stimulate bone growth, then twice-yearly injections of Prolia, to prevent losing that new bone. But Mrs. Sullivan is worried about possible side effects and plans to see if she can build her bone back naturally instead. “By next year, if my score hasn’t improved, I’ll seriously look into the medicine,” she says.

MONDAY, Feb. 15, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may help ease pain and improve quality of life for people with fibromyalgia, a new study suggests.

Ten weeks after treatment, the pain scores of patients given acupuncture dropped an average of 41 percent, compared with an average drop of 27 percent for those given a simulated acupuncture treatment. The benefits were still seen after a year.

""Individualized acupuncture is a safe and good therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jorge Vas, of the pain treatment unit at Dona Mercedes Primary Health Center in Seville, Spain.

Fibromyalgia patients have chronic widespread pain, which is associated with fatigue, poor sleep patterns and depression. The condition affects up to 5 percent of the population, Vas said. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of fibromyalgia patients are women.

According to the study authors, nine out of 10 patients try some form of alternative therapy, such as massage or acupuncture, in addition to their regular pain medication.

""Both acupuncture and traditional medicine have a place in treating fibromyalgia,"" said Dr. Alexander Rances, an acupuncturist, pain management specialist and attending physician at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.

""A combination of Western as well as traditional Chinese medicine probably offers these patients the best possible therapy,"" he said.

With acupuncture, extremely thin needles are inserted through the skin at strategic body points to treat pain.

Fibromyalgia treatment usually starts with medications such as the nerve pain medication Lyrica (pregabalin), and if that fails or is only partly effective, doctors might add acupuncture to the mix, Rances said.

For the study, Vas and colleagues randomly assigned 153 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia to individually tailored acupuncture or simulated acupuncture. Patients had nine weekly treatments, each session lasting 20 minutes.

""Although it was allowed for the participants to continue with the pharmacological [drug] treatment they were taking beforehand, when the study was finished, the patients who received individualized acupuncture were taking less medication than the group on sham acupuncture,"" Vas said.

At 10 weeks, six months and 12 months after treatment, patients were asked about perceived levels of pain and depression and their physical and mental quality of life.

One year after treatment, acupuncture patients had an average 20 percent drop in their pain score, compared with a little more than 6 percent among those who had simulated therapy, the researchers found.

Scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, which measures how the condition affects patients' lives, also differed between groups. Reductions were seen of 35 percent at 10 weeks, and just over 22 percent at one year, for those given real acupuncture, compared with 24.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for those given sham acupuncture, the researchers said.

In addition, pressure pain and the number of tender points also improved more in patients given real acupuncture after 10 weeks, as did measures of fatigue, anxiety and depression, Vas said.

However, although taking less pain medication, acupuncture patients were using higher levels of antidepressants after one year, which may have artificially boosted the positive results, he said.

The report was published online Feb. 15 in the journal Acupuncture in Medicine.

Dr. Allyson Shrikhande is a physiatrist -- a doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation -- at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that antidepressant use could have been a ""significant contributing factor to their continued improvement.""

Still, Shrikhande said, ""the findings in this study help demonstrate that acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain patients.""

Many patients with fibromyalgia have a central nervous system that is unregulated, meaning an abundance of pain signals are sent to the brain, Shrikhande said.

""Acupuncture can calm or quiet the nervous system and help slow down the pain signals to the brain. Acupuncture can also improve blood flow, which can improve oxygenation of tissues,"" she said.

Some insurance companies cover acupuncture, which costs about $125 a session, according to the University of California, San Diego Center for Integrative Medicine.

story_reviews_00480,"Two blood-building drugs injected soon after birth may give tiny preemies a lasting long-term edge, boosting brain development and IQ by age 4, a first-of-its-kind study found.

The study was small but the implications are big if larger, longer studies prove the drugs help even the playing field for these at-risk children, the researchers and other experts say.

Babies who got the medicine scored much better by age 4 on measures of intelligence, language and memory than preemies who didn't get it. The medicine group's scores on an important behavior measure were just as good as a control group of 4-year-olds born on time at a normal weight.

The results are ""super exciting,"" said Dr. Robin Ohls, the lead author and a pediatrics professor at the University of New Mexico. She said it's the first evidence of long-term benefits of the drugs when compared to no blood-boosting treatment.

Even though the treated youngsters didn't do as well as the normal-weight group on most measures, their scores were impressive and suggest greater brain development than the other preemies, Ohls said.

They scored about 12 points higher on average on IQ tests than the untreated kids but about 10 points lower than the normal-weight group. On tests measuring memory and impulsive behavior, the treated kids fared as well as those born at normal weight.

Here's how those differences would show up in a preschool setting: The untreated group would be the kids who struggle a little in class, while the those who got the medicines would do OK but not as well as those born at a normal weight, said Dr. Michael Schreiber, a prematurity expert at the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital.

Survival of extremely tiny preemies has improved dramatically in the past 50 years, but treatment for medical problems and developmental delays linked with prematurity has not kept pace, Schreiber said. He was not involved in the study.

He said larger studies including more diverse patient populations are needed to determine if the drugs can help a broader range of preemies.

The study involved 53 children, most white or Hispanic, born more than a month premature and weighing less than 3 pounds at hospitals in New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Two dozen normal-weight children were also included.

Results were published Monday in Pediatrics.

Shortly after birth the preemies were randomly assigned to receive injections of either erythropoeitin (EPO), three times weekly; darbepoetin once a week for several weeks; or no treatment. The drugs build red blood cells and are approved to treat anemia caused by cancer treatment or resulting from other conditions.

Preemies lack the ability to make new red blood cells and often need frequent blood transfusions to replace blood taken for lab tests. The drugs are now sometimes used to try to reduce their need for transfusions, in doses similar to the ones studied.

The drugs can increase endurance by boosting oxygen levels in the blood, and have been implicated in some sports doping scandals.

Dr. Sandra Juul, a University of Washington pediatrics professor, is leading a larger multi-center study of both drugs in preemies and said it's too soon to recommend the medicines for treating developmental delays.

Still, since almost half of infants born extremely early have significant developmental problems, any treatment that could improve their lives ""is incredibly important,"" Juul said.

story_reviews_00481,"Ten-year-old Mallory Oakes loves to read – in fact, she has been doing it since before she was 2 years old. Her mother knew she had a gifted child, but those gifts would not come without challenges.

“I think I knew from very early on that she was different, but she was my first child, so I figured anything that I saw, there was a chance that she would grow out of it,” Amy Oakes told FoxNews.com. “She would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age, she stopped napping around 15 months … any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum.”

Oakes didn’t know it then, but her daughter Mallory was one of more than 10 percent of American children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

“She was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom,” Amy said. “But there were other components to it -- there was oppositional defiant disorder, there were some [autism] spectrum-like behaviors, and difficulty later on socializing with other children.”

Oppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to ADHD in children and is characterized by anger, tantrums, opposition to authority and, sometimes, aggressive behavior.

For Mallory, the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left Amy reeling— and willing to try anything to control them.

“Initially, I tried a number of different things -- different kinds of therapies; art therapies. I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,” she said. “We tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.”

Medication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment.

“There were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,” Amy said. “She couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.”

Mallory’s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014.

“She wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school … in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,” Amy said.

Desperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies. That’s when she found the Brain Balance Achievement Center in Allendale, N.J.

“We went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible,” Amy said. “I thought we weren't going to get accepted to the program, and they told us they could help us and we never looked back.”

The specialized learning centers, of which there are now 80 throughout the country, were developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders, like Mallory.

“What thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time,” Melillo told FoxNews.com. “And if [kids] have poor coordination in their body, they often have poor coordination in their brain -- poor coordination between their networks -- so they can't bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way.”

The program uses a combination of sensory motor (physical) exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders.

“If you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain, those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues,” Melillo said. “The easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated, so a large part of what we're doing is this sensory motor interaction, building their muscle tone, building their strength, building their body spatial awareness.”

The program also incorporates what Melillo calls “bionutritional” guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning. Parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at-home exercises to do with their kids.

Mallory attended the Brain Balance Achievement Center three times a week after school for three months at a time, starting in November 2014. She has since gone on to complete two more cycles of Brain Balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition.

“She's playing on the basketball team now, she's involved in theatre -- things that she wasn't able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them,” Amy said. “I really felt very hopeless, before we found Brain Balance, so the fact that I just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing, and I think she can do anything she wants to do.”

story_reviews_00482,"In a bid for New Hampshire voters, presidential candidates have called for compassion for heroin and painkiller addicts. Off the campaign trail, there's intense debate over using opioid meds to kick opioid addiction.

Braeburn Pharmaceuticals

Scott Jernigan became addicted to painkillers after his failed back surgery. His doctor had prescribed a month’s worth of OxyContin, the signature drug of the nationwide painkiller addiction epidemic, and Jernigan followed it to the letter. Soon, the well-off businessman, husband, and father of two from Florida was an addict, buying pills on the street. In the last year of addiction, Jernigan snorted away a house, a boat, and almost his life. Even his dealer told him he needed to cut back. “A drug dealer telling you, ‘Hey man, you really ought to slow down,’” Jernigan, 52, told BuzzFeed News. “Can you imagine?” He’s just one of an estimated 2.1 million people across the United States who are addicted to opioid painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone (sold as OxyContin and Vicodin, respectively). Every day, 44 Americans die from a painkiller overdose. The central irony of the painkiller ""pandemic,"" as Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire called it in a January Senate hearing, is that it’s easy to prescribe painkillers but hard to prescribe medication to treat an addiction. These medications, notably the drug buprenorphine, are not panaceas, but studies have shown that they’re the best choice to help addicts get off painkillers. Trouble is, they’re also opioids themselves, and can result in dependency and highs all on their own, turning into street drugs in the last decade. Partly as a result, relatively few doctors are allowed to prescribe them, and these docs are limited in how many recovering addicts they can treat. In Shaheen’s Feb. 9 primary state of New Hampshire, the drug epidemic ranks as the No. 1 concern of voters in polls. There, presidential candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are calling for treating addiction as “a disease, not a moral failing.” And a move is afoot in Congress and the White House to ease restrictions on medications meant to fight addiction. Last Tuesday, the Obama administration announced that it is seeking $1.1 billion to fight the opioid epidemic, including a $920 million boost to medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction. And on Thursday, the FDA unveiled a new strategy for curbing rampant painkiller prescriptions, which includes making medication treatments more widely available. “I think the situation is sinking in,” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon told BuzzFeed News. “It is so out of control, and there is a real opportunity for action in this Congress.” Pharma, meanwhile, is ramping up its marketing of these medications, pitching them as pain relievers themselves and releasing new forms such as a patch and a mint-flavored tablet. One new option awaiting FDA approval, an implant, Jernigan credits with saving his life.

Two years into Jernigan’s addiction, at a stage when he was getting high only to stave off withdrawal, listless and miserable, another addict told him about a study a drug company was sponsoring at a nearby rehab center testing buprenorphine pills as a quitting aid. “I called on a Thursday and they said they had no openings. I was crushed,” Jernigan said. “Then they called back and said they had a sudden opening on Monday. I was very lucky.” Indeed, most addicts don’t get that opportunity. At the Senate hearing, politicians from both parties voiced outrage over the statistic that only about 1 in 5 prescription painkiller addicts who want help can gain entrance into a recovery program that offers them both medication and counseling, the best proven way to recover from addiction. (Many instead end up in dodgy rehab centers that quickly detox addicts, but don’t offer them medication or counseling to keep them from relapsing.) “I’m incredibly discouraged that we have more folks signing up for addiction treatment in Vermont now than we did when we started,” Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin testified, decrying the FDA’s recent approval of oxycodone for children. “We simply pass out painkillers like candy in America.” To counteract addictions to prescription painkillers (as well as heroin, their chemical cousin), Shumlin called for allowing nurses and physician assistants to prescribe buprenorphine, something they can readily do now for painkillers. The idea was seconded by senators from both parties. Since its approval in 2002, buprenorphine has become a leading medication for treating opioid addiction. Although it’s a chemical cousin to opioid painkillers and heroin, it provides less euphoria while saturating the brain’s opiate receptors, making it nearly impossible to overdose or get high off of other opiate drugs, like heroin. Most often it is sold as the drug Suboxone (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone, which blocks the high from other opioids to prevent misuse) in the form of strips that dissolve under the tongue, although it is also sold in generic tablets. Essentially buprenorphine serves as a bridge to stave off the pain of withdrawal. “You can’t quit when you are feeling sick,” said Jernigan, who started taking buprenorphine two years, five months, and a couple of days ago. He counts each day. Despite its effectiveness, buprenorphine has been slow to catch on: It’s now prescribed about 10 million times a year, typically in a monthlong dose, a fraction of the 200 million–plus prescriptions for opioid painkillers. Partly that’s because the government says that doctors can’t prescribe it to more than 100 patients, and most are limited to 30 or fewer. Even those doctors must take a short course to receive a waiver allowing them to prescribe the drug. Along with many doctors staying away from treating addicts, the restrictions explain why only about 29,000 of the nation’s 916,000 doctors prescribe the drug. In contrast, there are about 320,000 U.S. prescribers of extended-dosage opioid painkillers with unlimited prescribing privileges, according to FDA. Surveys suggest that most of the doctors allowed to prescribe buprenorphine are not psychiatrists or addiction specialists, epidemiologist Hannah Knudsen of the University of Kentucky in Lexington told BuzzFeed News. Their numbers have grown by about 20% in the last two years, however, partly reflecting southern states catching up to northern states in the number of accredited doctors.



Where Doctors Prescribe Buprenorphine Hannah Knudsen / University of Kentucky / Via cartodb.com Number of doctors who have received a buprenorphine waiver, per 100,000 residents, as of December 2015.

Traditional detoxification, where a patient is nursed through withdrawal and then returns home after about a month, is a lousy way to treat addiction. It leads to relapse about 90% of the time. But buprenorphine is not a miracle alternative. Of the 24 addicts, including Jernigan, who were in the study testing the drug with counseling, only 3 successfully quit, including him. Across many trials, buprenorphine leads to success in only one-quarter to one-third of addicts, according to FDA survey data presented last month at an advisory committee meeting. Plus, people do get high on buprenorphine. “If you make a drug more available, it will be abused,” R. Terry Furst of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice told BuzzFeed News. His own interviews with addicts and dealers suggest that opioid addicts sometimes use buprenorphine as a way to tide their cravings over, until they next binge on heroin. Furst is also worried about recreational drug users who binge on the weekends — he calls them “weekend warriors” — who are finding their way to “bupes.” So he’s not happy about the new moves in Washington to make prescribing buprenorphine easier. Raising the limits on the number of patients who can receive prescriptions or letting nurses prescribe buprenorphine under a doctor’s supervision “is insane,” he said. Not everyone agrees. Addiction specialists such as Gail D’Onofrio of Yale say that restricting buprenorphine prescriptions could hinder full-fledged recovery centers that offer counseling as well as medication. “People need help with a job, with mental issues, with their family, with putting their life together again,” D’Onofrio told BuzzFeed News. Those kind of services cost money, and the doctor becomes a bottleneck on the number of addicts that quality recovery centers can treat.

Last month, an FDA scientific advisory committee voted 12 to 5 in favor of a new approach: a six-month implant of buprenorphine for addicts who are “stable” in their recovery from prescription painkiller addiction. Called Probuphine, and developed by Titan Pharmaceuticals of California and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey, the implant buried in a patient’s upper arm will in theory deliver a six-month supply of the medication while limiting illicit sales. “It sounds like a reasonably good option for someone in recovery to ‘get it and forget it’ so they don’t have to remember their medication,” addiction treatment expert Marc LaRochelle of Boston Medical Center told BuzzFeed News. “I wouldn’t give it to everyone, but it would be nice to have another option.” The FDA had nixed the implant in 2013, overriding an earlier science panel vote for its approval, out of concern about a lack of safety data. FDA scientists again voiced concerns again at last month’s hearing, which largely debated a Braeburn-funded study finding the implant performed at least as well as the other approved forms of the drug in 176 addicts. Jernigan was one of the study volunteers, and he testified in favor of the implant at the Jan. 12 hearing, his travel paid for by Braeburn. “What the implant does is take away the reminder of how I screwed up every day, and the worry about missing my medication,” he said. “I don’t have to go to the pharmacy to get the look, ‘Oh you are one of those.’” At the same hearing, Braeburn representatives suggested that only 14% of the implant patients relapsed into illicit drug use during the trial, compared with 28% of daily pill users. About 25% of people now prescribed low doses of buprenorphine to treat addiction after about six months of recovery — or about 400,000 addicts — could benefit from implants, the company says. But the implant users ended up taking more medication overall than the daily drug users, pharmacologist Tracy Rupp of the National Center for Health Research testified, in a critique. That’s likely because it might take up to four weeks for the implant’s medication to kick in, she said, and the patients required extra medication until that happened. Doctors mishandling the transition from daily doses of buprenorphine to the implant might leave recovering addicts suddenly vulnerable to relapse. Furst also worries about addicts ripping the implants out of their arms to get high. “Never underestimate the ingenuity of someone addicted,” he said. But Braeburn representatives said at the hearing that little of the drug could be recovered from the implant that way. For Jernigan, an implant’s potential to remove him from the stigma of picking up his prescription counts as much as anything in its favor. “Everyone’s recovery is different, but this stuff saved my life,” Jernigan said to BuzzFeed News. “Not having to worry about forgetting it and reminding my wife of the problems I caused all the time would be wonderful.” “I feel sorry for all the people who didn’t make it,” he added. “I’ve worked hard, harder than I worked when I was young, the last few years. But it is also fun, clearing my mind finally. I can feel myself getting better.”",Could This Opioid Implant Really End The Opioid Epidemic?,4,BuzzFeed
story_reviews_00483,"(Reuters Health) - Exposing sleeping people to a series of short flashing lights at night might help them adjust more quickly to time zone changes, according to a new U.S. study.

In experiments, the technique – which is based on the way non-visual parts of the brain respond to light – was much more effective than sustained bright light similar to that from devices sometimes used to combat sleep disorders or seasonal depression.

“Jet lag itself is really a nuisance syndrome as it is self-resolving,” said senior author Jamie Zeitzer, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California.

Zeitzer was on the committee that removed jet lag as a “disease” from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the guide that psychiatrists use to diagnose mental illnesses.

“However, the treatments that are developed for jet lag can be used for less prevalent, though far more significant societal problems including delayed sleep in teens (in whom we have an ongoing clinical trial using the flash technique) and shift workers who try to flip between a night time schedule for work and a day time schedule for leisure,” he told Reuters Health by email.

The study included 39 people, 31 of whom were exposed to a series of two-millisecond light flashes with changing intervals while sleeping, and eight of whom were exposed to 60 minutes of continuous bright light.

A series of flashes similar to a camera flash delivered every 10 seconds over a 60-minute period delayed sleepiness by two hours, compared to a 36-minute delay for those exposed to continuous light for an hour, according to the results published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

“In essence, using the night before you traveled from California to N.Y. would move your circadian system two-thirds of the way there before you even left,” Zeitzer said.

Arriving in New York, you would be synced to the local time after one day, he said.

“The circadian clock is the central conductor of the many clocks that are found in nearly all tissues of your body,” Zeitzer said. “This clock remains synchronized with the external day through regular exposure to light.”

Nighttime flashes change the timing of the circadian clock, he said.

“For moving your system to a later time, such as would be necessary when traveling East-to-West, light during the first few hours of the night is ideal,” he said. “For moving your system to an earlier time, such as would be necessary when traveling West-to-East, light during the last few hours of the night is ideal.”

The night flashes require special technology and equipment, beyond just a smartphone, which are still in development, Zeitzer said.

In a previous study, the short flashes of light at night did not interrupt sleep or reduce its quality, he added.

“This is one of the real advantages of this system - you can change circadian timing while you sleep, without interfering with sleep,” he said.

Mistiming light therapy can make jet lag worse, cautioned Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, who was not part of the new study.

As for frequent flyers trying this themselves, it is “far too early – neither the methodology is available outside research, nor any guidance about safety, nor tests of simulated jet lag in an appropriate ‘realistic’ protocol,” Wirz-Justice told Reuters Health by email.

story_reviews_00484,"(CNN) Jet lag might be the worst part of long-distance travel, especially when it leaves you feeling tired, cranky and off-kilter for days.

But scientists at Stanford University say there may be a way to prevent jet lag without medication or adjusting your sleep schedule.

A team of researchers led by neurobiologist Jamie Zeitzer is working on a technique that exposes people to short flashes of light while they sleep to help them adjust more quickly to time zone changes.

Current light therapy treatment includes sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.

Exploiting biology 'in the eye'

Researchers believe the flashing light helps reset the circadian system , which regulates rhythms in the human body and establishes normal sleep and wake phases.

The circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms.

To adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.

Through light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person's brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment ""exploits biology in the eye"" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said.

This study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body's circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.

""The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?"" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.

Continuous light vs. flashes

To determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.

They found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.

""You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,"" Zeitzer said.

The treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that's a long way off. There's still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.",Jet lag research finds new potential treatment,3,CNN
story_reviews_00485,"Michael Burk found walking increasingly painful last year. Crossing the street and tying his shoes became challenges, and colleagues noticed he was limping at work.

On a recent morning, Mr. Burk reported to the Hospital for Joint Diseases, part of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, for hip-replacement surgery. His surgeon had promised him a better quality of life, and said both the operation and recovery would be quick.

About an hour later Mr. Burk was out of surgery. By 4 p.m. that afternoon he was upstairs in a ward, walking on crutches down the hall and going up and down a small model staircase. At 6 p.m., he left the hospital and headed home with his wife to Northern New Jersey, where he had a bowl of chicken soup.

Mr. Burk, 54 years old, had what NYU Langone calls same-day hip-replacement surgery, which practitioners say offers faster recovery times and less postoperative pain. With traditional hip surgery, patients typically spend days recovering in the hospital and may need additional time in a rehabilitation center.

Hip replacement, formally known as total hip arthroplasty, is considered one of the most effective surgeries in medicine, enabling the vast majority of patients to walk again pain-free. More than 340,000 of the operations are performed in the U.S. a year and include a growing number of patients in their 40s and 50s who want to maintain an active lifestyle.

The procedure replaces an arthritic or damaged hip joint with an artificial joint. In the traditional surgical method, known as the posterior approach, surgeons cut through muscle, tendons and tissues in the patient’s backside to get to the hip joint. The arthritic joint is removed and a prosthetic joint akin to a ball and socket is implanted, enabling the patient to move with greater ease.

Roy Davidovitch, who operated on Mr. Burk, is one of a growing number of surgeons offering the same-day hip-replacement technique. Dr. Davidovitch, director of NYU Langone’s Hip Center, uses a so-called anterior approach. He makes a four-inch incision in front of the hip, close to the groin, before going in to install the new joint. The procedure is performed through what he calls a “natural interval,” or opening between muscles, thereby avoiding cutting through muscle and tendons as with the posterior approach.

Dr. Davidovitch has performed about 100 same-day hip replacements in the past year. There have been no complications and only one hospital readmission for several hours when a patient reacted to the anesthesia, he says.

Joel Matta, an orthopedic surgeon at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., was an early adopter of the method in the U.S. and has performed more than 4,000 anterior hip replacements over the past 20 years. Dr. Matta, who helped train Dr. Davidovitch, designed a special operating table to help surgeons manipulate the patient’s legs and body to improve access to the surgical site.

As many as 26% of member surgeons performing hip replacements in the U.S. use the anterior method, according to a survey by the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. The technique is considered harder to master partly because the surgeon has less room to maneuver around the joint than with the posterior approach. But some surgical experts say there isn’t sufficient data to assert the technique is superior to traditional methods.

Jay Lieberman, president of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, says more studies are needed. “We don’t know which is the best approach,” says Dr. Lieberman, who is chairman of orthopedics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Some doctors question whether it is safe for patients to go home after hip surgery without spending a night being monitored in a hospital. “We should be careful,” says Vincent Pellegrini, orthopedics chair at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “It is still a big operation.”

Some research gives anterior hip replacement procedures a slight edge over the traditional technique. “Is it the cat’s meow? The answer is, somewhat,” says Jose Rodriguez, vice chairman of orthopedics at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, a part of Northwell Health, who has published studies comparing the different surgical approaches. “There is less muscle injury” and a patient’s early recovery is “definitely better,” says Dr. Rodriguez, who favors the anterior method in his own practice.

Although more patients getting anterior surgery are able to perform physical tasks more quickly, those receiving traditional surgery catch up after about six weeks. At that point “there is no difference” in how patients fare, Dr. Rodriguez says.

Most patients fully recover from hip replacement after about three to six months regardless of surgical approach, doctors say. By then, the bone has largely grown over the implant and it is safely affixed.

Anterior hip replacement patients often need less pain medication after surgery, practitioners of the technique say, although this varies by the individual. Other surgeons disagree, saying pain levels depend on pain management, not surgical approach.

Before getting same-day hip-replacement surgery at NYU in January, Barbara Ross, of Suffern, N.Y., was in near-constant, severe pain, she says. The day after the procedure she took “one or two Vicodins,” a narcotic painkiller, and since then, “absolutely nothing,” she says. “I am 100% better than I have been in years.” Ms. Ross, 62, is back at work running her public relations firm.

Multiple departments had to be on board when NYU launched its same-day hip-replacement program in 2015, including the chairman of orthopedics, Joseph Zuckerman. Dr. Zuckerman says he now wants to expand same-day hip replacement surgery to other approaches and other joints. The hospital has spent nearly $200,000 over the years on two special operating tables for the surgery.

Dr. Davidovitch says he needed a shorter-lasting anesthesia that would let patients get out of bed and walk the same afternoon. Mitchell Marshall, chief of anesthesiology for the Hospital for Joint Diseases, says his division was enthusiastic, but needed to make sure it could be done safely. The outcome: A spinal anesthetic that lasts 90 minutes, as opposed to the more than three-hour anesthesia standard for traditional hip surgery.

“At first, there was a lot of anxiety,” recalls nurse manager Ella Blot. “But we would see [patients] going home and we’d say, amazing.” To Ms. Blot, a 23-year nursing veteran, “the world has changed. They used to stay here two weeks, then 10 days, seven days, suddenly four days, two days” after hip-replacement surgery.

Keith Berend, senior partner at Joint Implant Surgeons in New Albany, Ohio, prefers the anterior approach. “It makes perfect sense that cutting no muscles will result in the fastest recovery,” he says. Still, other partners at the practice use another technique, called the lateral approach, in which the surgeon approaches the hip joint from the side. In all cases, patients at the facility go home the same day, he says.

“The experience of the surgeon, the efficiency of the team and the pain-management protocols” are the most crucial variables that make a same-day operation possible, Dr. Berend says.

Jeffrey Leeds, a 59-year-old private-equity investor in New York City, had same-day hip surgery at NYU in November. He says he was in so much pain before the operation that if he sat on the ground to play with his 2-year-old daughter, he couldn’t stand up.

Pain after the surgery was minimal, he says, and Tylenol was all he needed. Mr. Leeds was back at work within days: “My colleagues were hoping for a slower recovery,” he jokes.

The first germs to colonize a newborn delivered vaginally come almost exclusively from its mother. But the first to reach an infant born by cesarean section come mostly from the environment — particularly bacteria from inaccessible or less-scrubbed areas like lamps and walls, and skin cells from everyone else in the delivery room.

Photo

That difference, some experts believe, could influence a child’s lifelong health. Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother’s beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section.

The small proof-of-principle study suggests a new way to inoculate babies, said Dr. Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and lead author of the report, published on Monday in Nature Medicine.

“The study is extremely important,” said Dr. Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory who did not take part in the work. “Just understanding that it’s possible is exciting.”

But it will take further studies following C-section babies for many years to know to what degree, if any, the method protects them from immune and metabolic problems, he said.

Some epidemiological studies have suggested that C-section babies may have an elevated risk for developing immune and metabolic disorders, including Type 1 diabetes, allergies, asthma and obesity.

Scientists have theorized that these children may be missing key bacteria known to play a large role in shaping the immune system from the moment of birth onward. To replace these microbes, some parents have turned to a novel procedure called vaginal microbial transfer.

A mother’s vaginal fluids — loaded with one such essential bacterium, lactobacillus, that helps digest human milk — are collected before surgery and swabbed all over the infant a minute or two after birth.

An infant’s first exposure to microbes may educate the early immune system to recognize friend from foe, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.

Friendly bacteria, like lactobacilli, are tolerated as being like oneself. Those from hospital ventilation vents or the like may be perceived as enemies and be attacked.

These early microbial interactions may help set up an immune system that recognizes “self” from “non-self” for the rest of a person’s life, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.

In the United States, about one in three babies are delivered by C-section, a rate that has risen dramatically in recent decades. Some hospitals perform the surgery on nearly seven in ten women delivering babies.

An ideal C-section rate for low-risk births should be no more than 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization.

Dr. Dominguez-Bello’s study involved 18 babies born at the University of Puerto Rico hospital in San Juan, where she recently worked. Seven were born vaginally and 11 by elective C-section. Of the latter, four were swabbed with the mother’s vaginal microbes and seven were not.

Microbes were collected on a folded sterile piece of gauze that was dipped in a saline solution and inserted into each mother’s vagina for one hour before surgery. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector.

One to two minutes after the babies were delivered and put under a neonatal lamp, researchers swabbed each infant’s lips, face, chest, arms, legs, back, genitals and anal region with the damp gauze. The procedure took 15 seconds.

Dr. Dominguez-Bello and her colleagues then tracked the composition of microbes by taking more than 1,500 oral, skin and anal samples from the newborns, as well as vaginal samples from the mothers, over the first month after birth.

For the first few days, ambient skin bacteria from the delivery room predominated in the mouths and on the skin of C-section babies who were not swabbed, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said.

But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. They were all covered with lactobacilli.

Gut bacteria in both C-section groups, however, were less abundant than that found in the vaginally delivered babies.

Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth.

The results show the complexity of labor, said Dr. Alexander Khoruts, a microbial expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “It cannot be simplified to a neat, effortless passage of the infant through the birth canal,” he said.

As the month progressed, the oral and skin microbes of all infants began to resemble normal adult patterns, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. But fecal bacteria did not, probably because of breast or formula feeding and the absence of solid foods.

The transfer fell short of full vaginal birth-like colonization for two reasons, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Compared to infants who spent time squeezed inside the birth canal, those who were swabbed got less exposure to their mother’s microbes.

And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them.

A larger study of vaginal microbial transfer is underway at N.Y.U., Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Eighty-four mothers have participated so far.

Infants delivered both by C-section and vaginally will be followed for one year to look for differences in the treated and untreated groups and to look for complications. Thus far the swabbing has proved entirely safe.

The procedure is not yet recommended by professional medical societies, said Dr. Sara Brubaker, a specialist in maternal and fetal medicine at N.Y.U. Until more is known, physicians are hesitant to participate.

“But it has hit the lay press,” she said. “Patients come in and ask for it. They are doing it themselves.”

Dr. Brubaker is one of them. When her daughter was born three and a half months ago, she arranged to have her baby swabbed.

If the advice to eat more fiber seems easy to ignore, you're not alone. Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.

But if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.

A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.

The findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.

The researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.

Of course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.

This new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.

""This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,"" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.

In a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, ""There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels."" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.

The authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.

Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is ""a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,"" she says.

One limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be ""recall bias"" — the women's memories may be foggy.

""The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,"" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, ""people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.""

So, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?

This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.

She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. ""Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,"" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.

But, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. ""Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,"" says King. ""So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.""

Given the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.

Women are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.

So, how best to reach these targets? ""Add fiber at each meal,"" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.

story_reviews_00488,"Eating a high-fiber diet as a teenager, including lots of fruits and vegetables, may be another tool to help women lower their risk for later breast cancer.

A new study looking at diet and health data from more than 44,000 women found that those who reported consuming the highest amount of fiber during high school, about 28 grams a day, had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer before menopause compared with those who said they ate less than 15 grams a day.

The researchers from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.

""The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,"" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.

The findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.

Farvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.

""Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,"" Farvid said. ""Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.""

Eating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.

Healthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.

Why would these foods have such an impact?

In an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.

She said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.

One weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Blackwell said, ""It is reasonable for pediatricians to encourage a high-fiber diet and include decreasing breast cancer risk as one of the potential benefits.""

Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York, told CBS News, ""It lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on.""

Dr. Deanna Attai, assistant clinical professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, said that while it's an observational study, not a clinical intervention, its larger point about diet and health is important.

""The sexy headline is eat this and you'll have a lower risk of breast cancer, but I'd shift the focus to, eat more fiber because it's better for you and you'll be a healthier person and you're less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way,"" said Attai.

She added, ""The message is a good one as far as increasing fiber, but it also has to be put in perspective. This is just one mechanism by which we can reduce risk and it does warrant further study.""",Teen eating habits may help cut breast cancer risk,3,Cancer
story_reviews_00489,"Microcapsules loaded with stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells retrieved after they had been transplanted into a mouse.

Kendall Squared brings you dispatches from the world’s epicenter for biotechnology and drug discovery.

Scientists on Monday showed they had overcome some of the major hurdles standing in the way of a long-sought therapeutic fix for patients with type 1 diabetes, outlining an approach that the body’s immune system could tolerate and providing a possible pathway toward clinical trials in the next few years.

In people with type 1 diabetes, formerly known as juvenile-onset diabetes, the immune system dismantles the pancreatic cells that normally produce insulin. So researchers have long sought a way to put back healthy insulin-producing cells, known as beta cells, into patients.

“We’re trying to figure out a way to replace nature’s solution,” said Douglas Melton, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.

For years, physicians have been using beta cells from dead donors. But because the immune system of the recipient recognizes the donor cells as foreign, patients who receive a transplant have to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives.

Those drugs are not ideal, because they carry a risk of infection or cancer. Plus, donors are in short supply and can’t yield enough cells to treat the millions of people with type 1 diabetes around the world.

The researchers behind two studies published Monday demonstrated they had made progress on both fronts, encapsulating the cells in a protective bubble to shield them from the body’s immune response, and creating beta cells from stem cells, which are potentially limitless.

For the capsules, the scientists homed in on alginate — a seaweed extract — as the starting material. Alginate allows sugar and insulin to flow between the cells and the body, but blocks immune cells from reaching the beta cells.

The problem with existing alginates is that the body eventually catches on to the material as a foreign substance, suffocating the implant in a layer of scar tissue. So, Daniel Anderson, a bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, went in search of a better kind of alginate.

In one of two related studies published Monday, Anderson and his colleagues described in the journal Nature Biotechnology how they had tested 774 variations of alginate in rodents and monkeys and identified a handful that elicited a greatly reduced foreign body response.

For the other paper, published in Nature Medicine, the group embedded tiny capsules made from that durable alginate with beta cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. They then transplanted them into mice with a disease akin to type 1 diabetes.

The beta cells performed “every bit as good as the body’s own cells,” said Melton, a co-author on the Nature Medicine paper.

The transplanted cells controlled glucose levels in the mice without immune-suppressing drugs, the researchers reported. And when the scientists removed the capsules after almost six months, the cells were still cranking out insulin and there was little sign of an immune response to the capsules.

“From very early on, we were getting great success,” said Arturo Vegas, a lead author of the papers who worked in Anderson’s lab before moving to Boston University, where he is now an assistant chemistry professor.

“Everything kind of fell into place,” Vegas continued. “You saw less foreign body response. The human beta cells survived exquisitely well.”

The studies show “you can take stem cells and make a limitless supply of [human beta cells] and put them in a device and cure an entirely different species of animal,” Anderson said.

Just because the system produced strong results in mice does not mean people will respond the same way. But experts say the findings provide hope for future treatments for people.

“This is really the first demonstration of the ability of these novel materials in combination with a stem-cell derived beta cell to reverse diabetes in an animal model,” said Julia Greenstein, vice president of discovery research at JDRF, an organization trying to end type 1 diabetes that provided some funding for the studies. “Our goal is to bring that kind of biological cure across the spectrum of type 1 diabetes.”

The potential of the approach has attracted interest from both small startups and large biopharmaceutical companies that are looking at stem cell-based therapies for diabetes.

One company, San Diego-based ViaCyte, launched the first cell replacement clinical trial in 2014. Melton also recently helped start Semma Therapeutics, based in Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood. Semma has not begun any human clinical trials yet, but the goal is to develop a device that once implanted could control someone’s blood sugar for a year or more, saving them from insulin injections and needing to check their blood sugar every few hours.

“The individuals would not have to worry about that,” Semma CEO Robert Millman said.

Other companies pursuing stem cells treatments for diabetes include Novo Nordisk (NVO) and BetaLogics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).

Most of these other companies are taking a different approach from the work done in the studies published Monday.

The MIT team has developed tiny capsules for the cells, but ViaCyte, for example, has created a larger device outfitted with the cells that gets inserted under the skin. And whereas the Massachusetts researchers examined beta cells exclusively for their study, the ViaCyte team is exploring using less mature cells that, once implanted, differentiate into both insulin-producing beta cells and those that secrete another hormone called glucagon that’s deficient in the disease.

“The main issue with type 1 diabetes is a loss of beta cells,” said ViaCyte CEO Paul Laikind, “but there’s also good data out there to suggest dysfunction in other regulatory cell types.”

The team behind the studies published Monday, meanwhile, is working on tests now in monkey models. Vegas said that if the primate studies are successful, the next step will be developing a therapy to be used in people.

“I think we’ve advanced the ball pretty far, almost as far you could get in an academic environment,” he said. “The talk is shifting toward doing something clinically.”",Cell therapy in protective bubble offers hope for diabetes fix,4,"""cure"""
story_reviews_00490,"Thomas E. Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a “risk-mitigation” plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.

Zafgen Inc. is set Wednesday to release findings of a clinical trial showing many patients taking its experimental obesity treatment lost weight and engaged in less binge-eating, pointing to a way forward for a drug program halted by regulators last year after the deaths of two patients.

“We’re delighted with the results,” Hughes said in an interview. “This is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.”

The clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.

Many patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.

“As of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,” Hughes said. “This is a patient population that’s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.”

Zafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.

While the FDA’s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company’s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial’s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.

Zafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.

There are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.

It can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.

Average life expectancy of Prader-Willi syndrome patients is 32 years.

“The efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,” said Dr. Merlin G. Butler, director of research and genetics at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., and a principal investigator for the clinical trial there. “We’ve seen individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight in the six-month period. We think the drug must at least diminish the food-seeking drive, which correlates to an increased caloric intake in patients.”

Zafgen, founded in 2005, is backed by investors that include venture capital firms Atlas Venture of Cambridge and Third Rock Ventures of Boston. The company raised $96 million in an initial public offering in 2014, using the money to finance its clinical studies.

story_reviews_00491,"(Reuters Health) - Getting too little sleep during the week can increase some risk factors for diabetes, but sleeping late on weekends might help improve the picture, a small U.S. study suggests.

Researchers conducted a sleep experiment with 19 healthy young men and found just four nights of sleep deprivation were linked to changes in their blood suggesting their bodies weren’t handling sugar as well as usual.

But then, when they let the men get extra sleep for the next two nights, their blood tests returned to normal, countering the effect of the short-term sleep deprivation.

“It gives us some hope that if there is no way to extend sleep during the week, people should try very hard to protect their sleep when they do get an opportunity to sleep in and sleep as much as possible to pay back the sleep debt,” said lead study author Josaine Broussard of the University of Colorado Boulder.

The study doesn’t prove sleeping late every weekend can counter the ill effects of insufficient rest every other night of the week, Broussard cautioned.

And it doesn’t prove that catching up on sleep will prevent diabetes.

“We don’t know if people can recover if the behavior is repeated every week,” Broussard added by email. “It is likely though that if any group of people suffer from sleep loss, getting extra sleep will be beneficial.”

To assess the impact of sleep on diabetes risk, Broussard and colleagues focused on what’s known as insulin sensitivity, or the body’s ability to use the hormone insulin to regulate blood sugar. Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can’t properly convert blood sugar into energy.

The researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.

After the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers’ insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men’s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights’ rest.

The volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes. In the real world, when people don’t get enough sleep they tend to overeat, which may limit how much results from this lab experiment might happen in reality, the authors note in a report scheduled for publication in the journal Diabetes Care.

“The results from the present study are unlikely to be fully reflective of what may occur in persons who are older, overweight or obese, or have other potent risk factors for diabetes,” said James Gangwisch, a researcher at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the study.

Chronically sleep-deprived people are more likely to develop other health problems, though, ranging from obesity to high blood pressure to cognitive deficits, the study authors point out.

“By catching up on sleep on the weekends, people are reducing average extent and severity of the effects of sleep deprivation,” Gangwisch added by email. “Ideally, we would all get sufficient sleep on a nightly basis.”

""We associated these water dispensers with almost a one percentage point reduction in the likelihood of being overweight for boys and a little over a half a percentage point reduction for girls,"" said lead researcher Brian Elbel, an associate professor of population health and health policy at NYU School of Medicine.

""Even a small, straightforward, relatively inexpensive policy intervention was associated with a small but statistically significant drop,"" Elbel told CBS News.

Water jets also were linked with a decrease in the amount of half-pints of milk students bought, which could be a potential mechanism of weight reduction, the researchers found.

Modern water dispensers may be more effective than old-fashioned water fountains since water quality and cleanliness may deter kids from using older fountains, and they're not as efficient at serving large numbers of children, experts noted in an accompanying editorial.

The treatment destroys patients’ faulty immune systems through chemotherapy and then rebuilds them using stem cells previously harvested from their blood.

Doctors at Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield stress that the treatment, so far given to about 20 patients over three years, is not suitable for everyone with the disease, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal column.

The hospital is part of an international trial also involving patients in the US, Sweden and Brazil to see whether the treatment can benefit those with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, a form that involves flare-ups of symptoms such as loss of vision, fatigue, muscle problems and difficulties with balance that can last from a few days to a few months.

These will be followed by periods where symptoms are mild or disappear altogether.

Most people with MS – there are thought to be more than 100,000 in the UK – are diagnosed with this form, and although drugs may help slow progression, there is currently no cure.

Consultant hematologist John Snowden said: “The immune system is being reset or rebooted back to a time point before it caused MS ... The treatment has traditionally been used to treat bone and blood cancers.”

Basil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “The new treatment is showing some remarkable results in the small number of patients we have treated so far.

“It is important to stress, however, that this treatment is only suitable for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis disease who have had two or more significant relapses in the past 12 months, failed to respond to standard drug treatment and who have had the illness for at least 10 years.”

One patient who has undergone the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), told the BBC’s Panorama programme that he had made incredible progress.

Steven Storey, who was diagnosed with MS in 2013, said: “I went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care. At one point, I couldn’t even hold a spoon and feed myself.”

Within a few days of the transplant, he was able to move his toes, and after four months could stand unaided, although he still needs a wheelchair. “It’s been incredible,” Storey said. “I was in a dire place, but now I can swim and cycle and I am determined to walk.”

Holly Drewry was 21 when she was diagnosed with MS, and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter, Isla. “Within a couple of months I got worse and worse,” she said. “I couldn’t dress or wash myself; I didn’t even have the strength to carry my daughter.”

She had needed a wheelchair before her transplant, but after the treatment she walked out of hospital. Drewry, whose MS is described by doctors as “dormant”, said: “It’s been a miracle. I got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with Isla.”

Two years after the treatment, she has had no relapses and there was no evidence of active disease on her scans.

Paul Kirkham, another patient who has undergone the treatment at a cost of about £30,000, said: “It does knock you out. I’d rather have done 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.”

Richard Burt of Northwestern University in Chicago, who carried out the first HSCT for MS in 1995 and is coordinating the international trials, told the BBC: “There has been resistance to this in the pharma[ceutical] and academic world. This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.”

Emma Gray, the head of clinical trials at the MS Society, said: “Ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it’s clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama, they’ve had a life-changing impact.

“However, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS, it may not be effective for all types of the condition.

“We want people to be aware that HSCT is an aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks. It needs to be carried out at an accredited centre or as part of a clinical trial.

“The MS Society has recently funded a study looking into the impact of HSCT on the immune system and we’d like to see larger trials in this area. They would help us learn more about the safety and long term effectiveness of the treatment and who could benefit from it.”",Cancer treatment offers MS patients hope after 'remarkable' trial results,2,The Guardian

The Repurposing Drugs in Oncology – ReDO – project published a clinical study this week in ecancermedicalscience that the affordable, generic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – or NSAID – has cancer-fighting properties. While researchers already suspected NSAIDs can help prevent cancer, they're only now beginning to explore the ways that they could actually help treat the disease.

""It's still somewhat surprising that there is still so much we don't understand about how many of the standard drugs we use every day, like diclofenac, work,"" study author Pan Pantziarka, member of the ReDO project and the Anticancer Fund, said in a press release. ""But the more we learn, the more we can see that these drugs are multi-targeted agents with interesting and useful effects on multiple pathways of interest in oncology.""

Pantziarka and colleagues report that diclofenac may improve the immune system, the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation and the development of blood vessels. Previous studies have shown that the drug could reduce tumor size in fibrosarcoma, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer and several other cancers, according to the press release.

Treating cancer patients with diclofenac after surgery could also be beneficial, the authors wrote in the study.

story_reviews_00495,"Dr. Constance Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, who is not on the task force, said she was pleased to see that although its advice had not changed, the group had placed more of an emphasis than before on the importance of women’s having the freedom to decide how often to be screened and when to start.

The guidelines state that from ages 40 to 74, screening will reduce the odds of dying from breast cancer, with women 40 to 49 benefiting the least and those 60 to 69 benefiting the most. The task force said it concluded “with moderate certainty” that the benefit was moderate in women 50 to 74 and small in women 40 to 49.

For every 10,000 women screened repeatedly over 10 years, four lives are saved in women 40 to 49; eight in women 50 to 59; 21 in women 60 to 69; and 13 in women 70 to 74, the task force found.

“The science supports mammography as an important tool in the fight against breast cancer,” said Dr. Michael LeFevre, a former chairman of the task force and a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri. He noted that breast cancer deaths have decreased since mammography came into widespread use in the 1980s, though some of the decline, he said, was also due to better treatments. “We believe the benefits increase with age. But there are harms, and particularly in their 40s, women have to make a decision for themselves.”",Panel Reasserts Mammogram Advice That Triggered Breast Cancer Debate,5,Cancer
story_reviews_00496,"The task force's final recommendation is likely to be controversial because some other groups say the screening should start earlier. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for example, recommends that regular screenings begin at age 40, while the American Cancer Society calls for women to start yearly screening at age 45 and then move to screening every two years starting at age 55.

AD

Congress has sided with proponents of earlier screening. Last month, in anticipation of Monday's release of the task force’s final recommendation, lawmakers took preemptive action: It directed insurers to ignore the task force's latest guidelines and, instead, to rely on its 2002 recommendation. That called for annual mammograms to begin at 40. As a result of the congressional action, women in their 40s will continue to be able to get annual mammograms at no cost.

The differences over when to start regular screening reflect the growing concern that the benefits of mammograms may have been oversold, and that they don't outweigh the anxiety and potential harm caused by over-diagnosis and false positives from the tests.

The debate over when to start regular screening involves only women of ""average risk"" who don't have specific risk factors for breast cancer such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations or a family history of the disease. They're also not aimed at diagnostic mammography, which takes place once a woman has a symptom such as a lump. The screening recommendations are not binding on doctors, hospitals or insurers.

AD

In releasing its final recommendations, the task force confirmed an earlier guidance it issued that said screening mammography had the greatest benefit for women ages 50 to 74. For women in their 40s, the likelihood of benefit is less and the potential harms are proportionally greater, it said. The most serious potential harm is unneeded treatment for a type of cancer that would not have become a threat to a woman's health during her lifetime.

The congressional action, which was included in the recently enacted spending law, has drawn criticism from some experts.

“The U.S. Congress thinks it's perfectly acceptable, even preferred, for a scientific document from 14 years ago to guide coverage policy on screening for breast cancer in women,” says Kenneth Lin, a Georgetown University family medicine doctor who teaches preventive and evidence-based medicine.

AD

AD

Part of the problem is the common perception that women deserve free mammogram coverage and that the scientific community is basing its decision on cost or rationing, said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and expert on public health.

Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said the task force's guidelines for women in their 40s — that they should discuss whether to get mammograms with their doctors and make individual decisions — come closest to following the evidence accumulated over the past three decades. Women should trust that process, she said.

Despite the decades of marketing of mammography to women, ""women are capable of understanding the complexities of the issue, evaluating the evidence and making their own health decisions,"" she said in a statement.

""At some point we will have to decide that we are not going to pay for interventions that lack a high level of medical evidence,"" she said. ""At this time, what does concern us very much are attempts by Congress to interfere with the makeup and process of the US Preventive Services Task Force.""

The task force first suggested in 2009 that breast cancer screening begin at 50 instead of 40, touching off enormous criticism. In 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which required that certain preventive services be provided for free — if those services got a strong recommendation from the task force. But it included an amendment that effectively directed insurers to use the 2002 recommendations for mammograms. That meant that women who were 40 and older could get mammograms at no cost.

AD

AD

In April 2015, the task force came out with its latest draft guidance, basically reaffirming its 2009 recommendations that the greatest benefit of mammography screening is for women between 50 and 74.

Worried that millions of women under 50 could lose their free annual mammogram coverage if the guidelines became final, several health-care groups, including ACOG, the American College of Radiology and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, lobbied Congress to block that from happening.

Language was included in the spending bill that says any recommendations of the task force related to breast cancer screening, mammography and prevention refers to those “issued before 2009.”

AD

Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) was among the lawmakers who pushed for the language to be included. In a statement, she said her number one priority was to ensure that women can get mammograms if they and their doctors decide it's the right thing to do. ""This means making sure that cost is not a deterrent to care,"" she said.

AD

Several groups that lobbied for congressional action said in a statement last month that the task force recommendations conflict with those of other organizations. This results in confusion and puts more than 22 million women at risk of losing of losing insurance coverage for mammograms.

Hair samples may help determine the risk of a child developing mental and other chronic illnesses later in their life, research led by the University of Melbourne has found.

Researchers assessed the level of cortisol in the hair of 70 nine-year-old children from primary schools across Victoria. Cortisol is known as the “stress hormone” because it is released in response to acute stress to help the body react and cope.

The greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, such as divorce, injury, moving house, severe illness or the death of a family member, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations were, the researchers found.

It suggests hair cortisol levels may provide a marker of trauma exposure in children and identify those at risk of developing psychosocial and behavioural problems, and who may need medical and psychological support, leader of the study and a fellow in child and adolescent mental health at the University of Melbourne, Dr Julian Simmons, said.

“Childhood is an imperative and sensitive period of development, and when things go wrong it can have lifelong consequences, not just on mental health, but also on general health,” Simmons said.

“What’s less commonly understood is that beyond poor mental health, it can also be associated with the development of other illnesses such as diabetes, obesity and cholesterol issues, because cortisol is also central to glucose availability, blood pressure and immune function, so identifying these children is important.”

While blood or saliva tests could be used to detect cortisol levels, these methods were sometimes problematic, especially in children, Simmons said. Cortisol levels fluctuate during the day meaning results were not always accurate, and only revealed cortisol levels at a single point in time.

The tests could also be unpleasant and invasive for children, given blood tests require a needle and saliva tests require the child to fast beforehand.

“However, hair samples are not only easier to obtain, but provide us with a picture of total cortisol throughout the system across many months rather than just at a point in time,” Simmons said.

“Looking at hair tells us new things.”

The research is part of the ongoing Murdoch Childrens Research Institute’s Childhood to Adolescence Study following a cohort of 1,200 children in and around Melbourne and was published in the journal, Psychoneuroendocrinology.

Simmons said the results did not mean all children with elevated cortisol levels would go on to develop behavioural problems or mental illness, with many other social, environmental and genetic factors also involved.

But it did reveal it was important to further study hormones and the body’s endocrine system, and how they relate to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression, he said.

“We hope this can be used as one of the tools to identify children at risk,” he said.",Cortisol levels in children's hair may reveal future mental health risk,2,mental health
story_reviews_00498,"Marilyn Calick has suffered from asthma for as long as she can remember, but over the past decade she has also developed a condition that causes severe shortness of breath and chest tightness. Called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the lung ailment has forced 54-year-old Calick to use steroids and a rescue inhaler daily.

“You can’t get up and walk 10 or 15 feet to go to the bathroom without wheezing,” Calick, of West Hempstead, New York, told FoxNews.com.

Calick’s medications helped manage COPD, but anytime she stopped taking them, her symptoms would return.

As Calick ran out of options, she sought help from Dr. David Borenstein in New York City. Borenstein, an integrative medicine physician, is one of numerous doctors in the world who is using stem cell therapy to treat various diseases.

Stem cells, which can self-renew and replace damaged areas of the body, have been used in the treatment of orthopedic, cardio, autoimmune, neurological— and pulmonary disorders, like Calick’s.

For the procedure, Borenstein draws fat cells from the patient’s buttocks or midsection during liposuction, and then separates the stem cells in a centrifuge. Next, stem cells are mixed in a solution, which is administered through an IV and put into a nebulizer, from which the patient inhales them.

""The ideal candidate for this procedure is someone with an early-stage [form of] COPD, so we can halt the progression of the disease,” Borenstein told FoxNews.com.

Borenstein said about two-thirds of his patients see COPD relief within several weeks to about five months, and that those results last for about a year.

Although Borenstein’s stem cell treatments for COPD isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or covered by health insurance, Calick said the procedure— which costs less than $8,000— was well worth the price.

""I could walk further, I'm not wheezing , I could go out with different friends, stand for long periods of time, walk places,” Calick said of her condition after the stem cell therapy. “[If] someone says, ‘Oh, you're using the elevator,’ [I say], ‘No, I’m using the stairs!”

TUESDAY, Jan. 5, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- For the sixth year in a row, a panel of health experts has named the heart-healthy DASH diet the best overall eating plan, according to U.S. News & World Report's 2016 Best Diets ranking.

The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was designed to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels by limiting fats, red meat and sugar in favor of healthy grains, poultry, low-fat dairy and nuts, the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says.

""Our rankings put hard numbers on the belief that no one diet is ideal for everybody, but the best food plans overall are sustainable,"" Angela Haupt, senior health editor at U.S. News & World Report, said in a news release from the media company.

Every year, U.S. News & World Report asks experts to rank various diets to help the tens of millions of dieters in the United States and around the globe make informed dietary decisions that can help them achieve healthier lifestyles.

The panel of experts -- including nutritionists and doctors specializing in diabetes, heart health and weight loss -- scored each diet for short-term and long-term weight loss. They also considered how easy each diet was to follow, as well as safety and nutritional value.

""Besides the rankings and data, each diet has a detailed profile that includes how it works, evidence that supports or refutes its claims and a nutritional snapshot -- tools that, along with the advice of a physician or nutritionist, can help consumers invest in diets that suit their lifestyles and further their health and wellness goals,"" Haupt said.

The panel evaluated 38 of the most popular or trendy diets this year. After ranking them in nine categories, the experts found the MIND diet tied for second place for best overall diet with the cholesterol-lowering TLC diet. The MIND diet includes some features of the DASH diet and Mediterranean diet, such as high consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, but focuses on foods that promote brain health.

The MIND diet ranked first in the ""Easiest Diet to Follow"" category in a three-way tie with Weight Watchers and the Fertility diet, which asserts that certain dietary changes can boost fertility.

The Fertility diet, which calls for the elimination of trans fats, also ranked as the best diet for diabetes, the report revealed. The Biggest Loser diet and the DASH diet came in second and third, respectively, in the diabetes category.

The DASH diet scored highest when it comes to healthy eating, followed by the TLC diet. The Mediterranean and the MIND diet tied for third place in this category.

The Weight Watchers diet ranked highest out of all weight-loss diets but tied with the Mayo Clinic diet as the ""Best Commercial Diet.""

When it comes to speedy weight loss, the HMR program and Biggest Loser diet shared the top ranking, followed by the Atkins diet in second place and Weight Watchers in third.

On the opposite end of the list, the Whole30 diet -- a 30-day program that bans processed foods, legumes, grains, dairy, alcohol and added sugar -- ranked as the worst overall diet on the list, the new report said.

The Raw Food diet and low-carb Atkins diet also scored poorly overall and ranked low in categories like ""Best Diets for Healthy Eating."" The Raw Food diet was also considered the most difficult diet to follow, though it was one of the top ranked weight-loss diets, the panel found.

One of the great public-health success stories of the past couple of decades can be found in your cereal bowl.

Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required that breakfast cereals, breads, rice, pasta and other grain products made with enriched flour come fortified with folic acid. When consumed by women before and during early pregnancy, this B vitamin plays a critical role in preventing severe brain and spinal cord defects. Thanks to mandatory fortification, the number of babies born in the U.S. with neural tube defects has dropped by roughly 35 percent — or about 1,300 babies a year — since the 1990s.

""The story of folic acid is one of the great public health stories of — ever,"" says Dr. R.J. Berry, who works with the Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.

But there's one notable exception to this success story — Hispanic women — and researchers think the reason may lie in a staple of their diet: tortillas.

Under current FDA rules, tortillas, corn chips and other foods made with corn masa flour can't be fortified with folic acid. So a coalition of groups including the March of Dimes Foundation and the National Council of La Raza has petitioned the FDA to change its stance and allow corn masa flour to be fortified with folic acid.

According to the March of Dimes, about 3,000 pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by neural tube defects each year. The rates are highest among Hispanics: Latina women are roughly 20 percent more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect compared to non-Latina white women.

The exact cause of this discrepancy isn't known. Researchers say there may be genetic factors that predispose the children of some Hispanic women to neural tube defects. But they suspect diet is also a factor: ""Part of the reason was that these groups just weren't consuming the same level of wheat flour products. Instead, they were consuming corn masa flour products, because that was the staple grain in that diet,"" says Cynthia Pellegrini, senior vice president of public policy and government affairs at the March of Dimes.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Verónica Zaragovia for NPR Verónica Zaragovia for NPR

Research has shown that women who consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily have a significantly reduced risk of having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects — including spina bifida, which can involve paralysis, and anencephaly, in which large parts of the brain are missing. The catch: Folic acid is only protective if consumed in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.

""Most women, by the time they know they're pregnant, they've already passed that critical window,"" says Dean Appling, a biochemistry professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""If they had a problem with folic acid, it would be too late at that point to prevent the birth defect.""

Mandating fortification helps ensure that women are getting enough folic acid even before they know they need it. And studies suggest that fortifying corn masa with folic acid could prevent an additional 40 to 120 cases of neural tube defects among babies born to Hispanic mothers each year.

So why does the FDA currently ban dosing corn masa flour with folic acid? It all has to do with nixtamalization, the process by which tough corn kernels are softened by soaking in an alkaline solution, usually of slaked lime. The process, which hails from ancient Mesoamerica — what's now Mexico and Central America — dates back thousands of years. It renders the corn more pliable for grinding into masa flour and gives the masa its distinctive aroma and flavor.

But the FDA worries that this alkaline treatment could also ""affect the stability of added folic acid,"" the agency told The Salt in a statement. ""The FDA is concerned that the breakdown of folic acid in corn masa flour could yield a substance that raises concerns about safety.""

The March of Dimes and others first petitioned the FDA to allow added folic acid in corn flour masa in 2012. As part of its review, the FDA asked the petitioning groups to study whether folic acid would stay stable in corn masa flour.

The petitioners filed the results of that study in October. Michael Dunn, the Brigham Young University food scientist who led the study, cannot comment on the test results while they're under FDA review, but he has previously called them encouraging. As The Seattle Times has reported, Dunn's early results suggested no loss of folic acid in fortified masa after three months of storage.

The March of Dimes' Pellegrini says she believes the FDA will respond to the results of Dunn's study later this month. But the FDA might have more questions related to the study before making a final ruling.",Why Tortillas May Hold The Key To Healthier Babies,4,Diet studies

MONDAY, Jan. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications, new research suggests.

Scientists at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City said their findings settle a longstanding debate about which of two types blood-pressure lowering medications studied are better.

An analysis of 106 randomized trials involving more than 250,000 patients examined the effects of newer angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and older angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.

According to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.

""There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,"" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.

""We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,"" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.

Both ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.

Angiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.

Previous studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.

However, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.

""This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,"" Bangalore said.

""The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,"" he added.

story_reviews_00502,"Now a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors.

Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of cardiology at NYU Langone Medical Center who is lead author of the new study, said in an interview that the previous studies comparing the two may have been misinterpreted due to what he called a ""generation gap"" in participants and changes in their health care and lifestyle choices.

AD

AD

The idea that ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs was based on comparing studies on ACE inhibitors going as far back as the 1980s and into the 1990s with newer studies on ARBs in the 2000s.

These studies appeared to show a larger difference between ACE inhibitors and placebos versus ARBs and placebos. Most significantly, research showed a significant effect in reducing the risk of death with ACE inhibitors but not with ARBS. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs.

But some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?

AD

AD

That inconsistency created a confusing split in the medical community. Most guidelines set forth by the major medical groups suggest starting a patient with an ACE inhibitor first, but the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) considers ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equal.

Bangalore noticed that one assumption made in comparing the placebo trials -- that the patients in the group were about the same -- was incorrect. During that time period there was a remarkable shift in cardiovascular health care in America -- with a greater emphasis on not smoking, more statin use for cholesterol, better management of diabetes, lower targets for blood pressure.

""The patients in the '80s and '90s were a higher-risk group than those in the 2000s,"" Bangalore explained. ""If your risk is higher it's easier to show a benefit. If your risk is lower it's harder to show a benefit.""

AD

AD

The new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The one difference they found was that ARBs tend to be better tolerated by patients, meaning that they have fewer side effects or result in fewer adverse events. ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated by many patients because they can produce a bothersome dry cough, and some end up stopping medication as a result.

Bangalore said this is critically important because ""compliance is big issue with our patients.""

""With hypertension they are on these medications for decades, and it's important to choose one that will be the most tolerable,"" he said.

AD

AD

The other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.

The study was limited to patients who did not have heart failure, and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.

Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.

Yoga enthusiasts link the practice to a long list of health benefits, including greater flexibility and range of motion, stronger muscles, better posture and balance, reduced emotional and physical stress, and increased self-awareness and self-esteem.

But definitively proving these benefits is challenging, requiring years of costly research. A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time.

The subjects must provide health measurements at the outset, learn the proper poses, continue to do them regularly for years and be regularly evaluated.

No one knows these challenges better than Dr. Loren M. Fishman, a physiatrist at Columbia University who specializes in rehabilitative medicine. For years, he has been gathering evidence on yoga and bone health, hoping to determine whether yoga might be an effective therapy for osteoporosis.

The idea is not widely accepted in the medical community, but then, researchers know comparatively little about complementary medicine in general. So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.

Knowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.

Those medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.

Many of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.

On the other hand, yoga’s “side effects,” Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, “include better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.”

Weight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.

“Yoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,” he said in an interview. “By opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.”

Most experts argue that it’s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators — Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University — solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.

Of the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.

The 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.

The researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants’ bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.

A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.

Improvements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.

Before the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.

At the time the study was submitted for publication, “with more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,” Dr. Fishman and his colleagues wrote.

“Yoga looks like it’s safe, even for people who have suffered significant bone loss,” Dr. Fishman said in an interview.

Furthermore, a special study of bone quality done on 18 of the participants showed that they had “better internal support of their bones, which is not measured by a bone density scan but is important to resisting fractures,” Dr. Fishman said.

The study has many limitations, including the use of self-selected volunteers and the lack of a control group. But all told, the team concluded, the results may lend support to Dr. Fishman’s long-held belief that yoga can help reverse bone loss.

Even if bone density did not increase, improvements in posture and balance that can accrue from the practice of yoga can be protective, Dr. Fishman said.

“Spinal fractures can result from poor posture, and there’s no medication for that, but yoga is helpful,” he said.

In addition, “Yoga is good for range of motion, strength, coordination and reduced anxiety,” he said, “all of which contribute to the ability to stay upright and not fall. If you don’t fall, you greatly reduce your risk of a serious fracture.”

For years, research has shown that babies born by cesarean section are more likely to develop health problems. Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky.

The research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies’ long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries.

Surprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor — that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process — may give children a healthy start, even when it’s interrupted by a surgical birth.

The new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991.

Dr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section “are missing out on.”

“Our thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,” Dr. Black said.

Even attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely.

“When you don’t wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,” said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. “What is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?”

Studies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes.

The Scottish study took advantage of the small country’s rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births.

The researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer.

Over all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section.

The biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers.

All of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies.

Although all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births.

No one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby’s lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section.

The step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding.

During labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis.

The theory is that maternal microbes “train” the infant’s immune system, so it doesn’t overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes.

“It’s an education process that says, ‘Calm down, you’re going to be seeing this antigen again, you don’t have to be so aggressive,’” Dr. Neu said.

Dr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria.

The findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor.

Childbirth and labor are “a physiological process that we’ve evolved to over millions of years,” Dr. Caughey said. “It’s been really well-designed by evolution.”

story_reviews_00505,"Drinking cow’s milk produced at night may be a treatment for anxiety and insomnia, suggests an animal study in the Journal of Medicinal Food.

A glass of milk at bedtime has long been touted as a sleep aid. But the study found that milk collected at night, or night milk, had enhanced sedative effects in mice compared with milk produced during the day. Night milk significantly decreased the rodents’ physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed.

Mice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said.

Night milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in South Korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow’s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24% more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: Mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice given day milk. Diazepam-treated controls fell about nine times, while the water-fed controls fell twice. Caveat: The effects of night milk haven’t been tested on people with sleep problems and anxiety disorders.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Dec. 7, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Evidence is mounting that a marijuana-derived oil might benefit some children with epilepsy whose seizures aren't controlled by approved medications, two new studies show.

Cannabidiol (CBD) significantly reduced seizures in as many as half of children with epilepsy, researchers planned to report Monday at the American Epilepsy Society's annual meeting, in Philadelphia.

But experts say these positive findings may have been influenced by a ""placebo effect."" All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness.

""We know that our placebo rates can be as high as 30 percent, and sometimes higher,"" said Dr. Amy Brooks-Kayal, American Epilepsy Society president, who wasn't involved in the studies.

""We don't know the real effect of the cannabidiol, and we won't until we complete the studies that are ongoing that are placebo-controlled and blinded,"" added Brooks-Kayal, who is also a professor of pediatrics, neurology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

There also are concerns that cannabidiol may interact badly with some anti-seizure medications approved for epilepsy treatment, according to another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting.

Cannabidiol is a major chemical component of marijuana, said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at NYU Langone Medical Center's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City and co-author of one of the studies.

CBD doesn't produce intoxication like pot's other major chemical compound, THC. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said.

""This receptor has several effects, but one of them may be to modulate the calcium inside and outside the neuron, which is very much related to the excitability of nerve cells,"" he explained.

Previous studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.

""There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,"" she said.

To see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.

Everyone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said. This was in addition to their current drug therapy.

After three months, seizure frequency declined by an average 45 percent in all participants. Almost half experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures, and about one of every 10 patients became seizure-free, the study found.

""This was a very, very treatment-resistant group, and the response was very promising,"" Devinsky said.

A second study from the University of California, San Francisco, explored the long-term effectiveness of cannabidiol for children with epilepsy, by adding the marijuana-derived oil to the regular drug regimen of about 25 kids for one year.

The study found that after a year, the treatment resulted in a 50 percent reduction in seizures for 10 participants -- about 40 percent of the group. One child remained seizure-free, but 12 of the initial participants dropped out of the study because the cannabidiol didn't seem to do them any good.

Although he said he would prescribe CBD to people with uncontrolled seizures, Devinsky said he is ""very anxious"" to see the results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials. The results of one major trial are expected in the first quarter of 2016, he added.

If CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.

Federal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs. Another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting found that CBD appeared to enhance the effects of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam (Keppra), when given to lab mice.

However, the oil appeared to interact negatively with two other drugs, clobazam (Onfi) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), the University of Utah researchers found.

Data and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

When the researchers examined a small subset of the group — those who survived 10 years — they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.

""Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,"" said Mary C. Schroeder, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the study. ""It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995.""

Previous research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.

""It's premature to suggest, and it’s a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,"" Sabel said.

Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said.

In a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman's immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously ""seeding"" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body.

In their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa's Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63.

The researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed.

AD

AD

In interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is.

But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said.

""Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,"" they wrote in their paper. That would include younger women whose cancers have not spread in great volume to other organs and who have certain kinds of cancers that respond better to drugs, Lisa Newman, medical director of the Henry Ford Health System's International Center for the Study of Breast Cancer Subtypes, said in an e-mail. Newman was not involved in the study.

""Theoretically...patients with metastatic breast cancer might benefit from surgery to remove the cancerous breast tumor in combination with medical therapies as a more complete reduction of their total body cancer burden,"" she added.

story_reviews_00508,"Days after bringing home her newborn twin daughters, Alysia Vaccaro could sense Evangelina wasn't as healthy as her sister.

""I had a baby to compare her to and I just knew, something was wrong with her,"" Vaccaro told CBS News.

Her mother's intuition was right. Testing revealed Evangelina was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, also called SCID or ""bubble baby"" disease.

It's a genetic disorder that leaves the body with a weakened immune system, making infants extremely vulnerable to illness. It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.

Symptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina. Babies with SCID often come down with recurrent, severe respiratory infections that can be life threatening, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.

""We wore masks, we had hand sanitizer, we had raw hands from cleaning so much,"" Vaccaro recalled.

The Vaccaros turned to Dr. Donald Kohn at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, where Kohn focuses on the development of new methods to treat genetic diseases of blood cells. They enrolled baby Evangelina in a clinical trial there.

Dr. Kohn said of an experimental treatment for SCID, ""It's gone from a 'one day, maybe' to a real clinical reality.""

That means an actual cure for the disease, said Kohn, who is also director of the Human Gene Medicine Program at UCLA. His treatment involves taking bone marrow from the patient to gather stem cells. A cloned gene is then added to correct what was missing at birth.

""Those stem cells are given back to the patient where they can go back to the bone marrow and make the blood cells for the rest of the patient's life,"" Kohn said.

Evangelina is now 3 and healthy. CBS News

So far, the treatment has restored immune systems in all 23 patients in the most recent clinical trials, including Evangelina.

""It is a cure. I know it's a cure. We're living the cure,"" said Vaccaro.

Now 3 years old, doctors say Evangelina is in perfect health.

story_reviews_00509,"Any woman who is struggling with infertility will tell you that one of the worst parts of going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) are the daily hormone injections. And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.

Although IVF is still considered the gold standard, there’s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope — in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.

What is IVM?

IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman’s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn’t the same.

With IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course— between 3 and 6 days— of hormones known as a “priming phase.”

Once the eggs are retrieved, they’re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.

Clinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.

Who is IVM helpful for?

Although IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.

For starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.

IVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.

IVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)— which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF— may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.

More on this... What is ICSI infertility treatment?

What are the limitations of IVM?

A study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.

Yet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.

Although there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren’t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.

Plus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM—between 5.5 and 21.6 percent— are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn’t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.

Since IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn’t use ICSI, Shastri said.

While IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.

Although IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.

“With medicine, you always want to optimize a patient’s outcome,” Shastri said. “Ultimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.”",The alternative infertility treatment that's helping some women get pregnant,3,Fox News

story_reviews_00511,"Light therapy is cheap, easy to use and comes with few side effects compared to medication such as antidepressants, said lead author Raymond Lam, a professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia.

AD

Previous research on light therapy for non-seasonal depression has been limited. This study ""shows a new, proven-safe treatment of depression that is probably both more effective and less expensive than drug treatment or anything else,"" said Dan Kripke, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the topic but was not involved in the latest trial.

AD

The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Most people typically receive medication and psychotherapy — but medications don't work in all cases and there's a shortage of providers in many areas.

AD

Lam and his colleagues followed 122 patients and evaluated whether light therapy improved their mood when it was used both with and without fluoxetine, or Prozac, a commonly prescribed antidepressant. Over eight weeks, participants were exposed daily to 30 minutes from a fluorescent light box soon after waking up. Some participants were instead given placebo pills and placebo devices.

AD

Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. About 60 percent of those using light therapy with the antidepressant reported feeling almost back to normal, Lam said.

AD

Researchers have two main theories on why light therapy works. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain. There's some evidence that depression, like jet lag, occurs when the biological clock is out of sync, and light helps to correct that, Lam said.

Light is also believed to affect neurotransmitters in the brain. Those are considered important for the development of depression and are the targets of most antidepressant medications.

story_reviews_00512,"Story highlights A new study suggests that people who drink a lot of coffee have lower rates of death

Researchers suspect that ingredients in coffee could have direct health benefits

(CNN) Throughout the ages, coffee has been called a virtue and a vice for our health. The latest study comes down in favor of virtue: It says that drinking coffee, whether regular or decaf, could reduce the risk of death.

Researchers started with data from surveys of adults in the United States that asked how much coffee they consumed, as well as other foods and drinks, and then they looked at their rates of death and disease over the following two decades.

The study was large, including more than 200,000 women and 50,000 men.

At first, researchers did not see an obvious relationship between coffee consumption and death rates. Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.

But when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers. Those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had 15% and 12% lower death rates.

story_reviews_00513,"Gut Check is a periodic look at health claims made by studies and by newsmakers. We ask: Should you believe this?

The Claim: If you drink coffee you’ll live forever! Well, almost: nurses and other health professionals who drink coffee (regular or decaf) had a lower risk of premature death than coffee abstainers.

The Backstory: . . . is enough to make STAT cross-eyed. Decades of studies have examined links between coffee drinking and health outcomes. Overall, the conclusions have been pro-coffee. Lots of research has linked coffee drinking to a lower risk of dying early, including this, this, and this. Other studies have found associations with lower risk of specific conditions, like this on cardiovascular disease (by many of the same authors as the new study), this on stroke, this on heart failure, and this on diabetes. Most research has found the greatest benefits with daily consumption of around three or four cups — usually 6 to 8 ounces, and without distinguishing regular from decaf. Fewer studies link coffee to a higher likelihood of dying prematurely, but this classic found a link between 6-plus cups a day and dying of cardiovascular disease, while this 2013 paper, on 43,727 people followed for a median of 17 years, concluded that adults under 55 who averaged more than 4 cups a week had a 56 percent (men) or 130 percent (women) higher risk of dying over the study period than non-coffee drinkers.

First Take: The new research, published in Circulation on Monday and funded by the National Institutes of Health, mined three large, ongoing epidemiological studies (74,890 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, 93,054 women in the Nurses’ Health Study 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), following them for at least 20 years. Overall, the heaviest coffee-drinkers (more than five cups a day, regular or decaf) had a tiny 2 percent additional risk of dying compared with coffee abstainers. Those drinking 1.1 to 3 cups, and 3.1 to 5 cups, had slightly (9 percent and 7 percent) lower risks of dying.

advertisement

Then the researchers, led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, did something clever: they ran the analysis on nonsmokers only. That eliminated the stereotypical coffee-swilling, cigarette-sucking types. Result: people drinking 1.1 to 3 cups a day had an 8 percent lower mortality risk, while the 3.1-5-cup crowd had a 15 percent lower mortality risk, mostly due to lower risk of deaths from cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and suicide. Even the 5-plus’s had 12 percent lower mortality.

A co-author of the 2013 study linking heavy coffee drinking to higher mortality called the new one “very good,” especially since it controlled for the deadly effects of smoking, which the earlier one did not. It “supports the safety and efficacy of even high doses of coffee in non-smokers,” said Dr. Carl Lavie, a cardiologist at Ochsner Health System. But given the 2013 research suggesting “toxicity of high coffee doses” in some people, he said, “to me the most reasonable approach would be to keep coffee intake to two to three cups most days.”

Second Take: STAT knows better than to get between coffee lovers and their cup o’ joe, so if you want to take this study as permission to keep beating a path to your Keurig, we’re not going to slow you down.

But…

This is another observational study, where researchers look for associations between people’s freely-chosen diet and other lifestyle decisions and subsequent health outcomes. Correlations do not establish causation: a link between Behavior A and Health Outcome B might or might not mean that A caused B. It might mean instead that a third factor — another behavior, socioeconomic status, even personality or genetics — might go hand in hand with Behavior A and be the true cause of Outcome B. Maybe people who drink coffee have some genetic, psychological, or behavioral trait (drinking fewer sugary beverages? eating less junk food?) that causes the observed benefit.

But surely the population in this study is so huge and socioeconomically similar (all health professionals) that correlation is more likely to reflect causation?

More likely, yes, but don’t count on it. This same Nurses Health Study, for instance, infamously found a correlation between post-menopausal hormone therapy and lower risk of cardiovascular disease and death, here and here. That turned out to be wrong. The definitive, randomized Women’s Health Initiative study showed that hormone therapy raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, contradicting the NHS and shocking nearly everyone.

Takeaway: Observational studies that associate coffee drinking with health benefits are strongly suggestive but not definitive. If you do want to infer causation from this latest study, know that drinking coffee reduced the absolute mortality risk from 6.8 deaths a year per 1,000 people to, at best, 5.8. That is, each year, coffee would be keeping 1 person in 1,000 from dying.",Will drinking coffee extend your life?,5,limits of observational studies

MONDAY, Nov. 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-feeding a premature infant may help reduce the risk of a serious eye problem known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), new research suggests.

The researchers said that when babies were exclusively fed breast milk, the risk of any-stage ROP appeared to drop by about 75 percent. And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90 percent, the researchers added.

""Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP,"" the international team of study authors wrote.

Retinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. When the vessels grow, they can cause the retina to detach, destroying vision, according to the U.S. National Eye Institute.

For the study, researchers from China, Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on ROP. The studies included more than 2,200 preterm infants, comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula, and whether or not they developed ROP.

However, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study's design.

Results of the study were published online Nov. 16 in Pediatrics.

Extremely preterm babies are most at risk of ROP. In the United States, 59 percent of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder, said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, in Shanghai. He added that in China, a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50 percent in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds).

ROP ""has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time,"" Chen said. ""In general, there are more ROP cases in developed countries, but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing countries.""

The greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries, according to Chen. In developing countries, preterm babies are less likely to survive. When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely.

Babies in the studies had a range of gestational ages, from 26 to about 30 weeks. Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds. No information was given about how long the breast-feeding continued.

In re-evaluating the studies, Chen's team found that breast-feeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP. And it appeared that the more breast milk, the better. Exclusive breast-feeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75 percent compared to exclusive formula use. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed.

How might human milk offer protection from the eye disorder? The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. Breast-feeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy, which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP, the study authors said.

Dr. Adolfo Llanos, a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, who was not involved with the new study, said the ""quality of this analysis is very good. It's reassuring to see the benefit we see with breast milk.""

He said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body. ""Preemies don't regulate inflammation in their bodies well,"" he said.

Llanos cautioned that the study looked only at a mother's own breast milk, not donor milk, which can be used when the biological mother doesn't have enough of her own breast milk.

The takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible.

The drugs are intended to target the illness after it has spread to other parts of the body or can’t be removed by surgery.

According to the FDA, Cotellic and vemurafenib, which is marketed under the Zelboraf brand name, prevent or slow cancer cell growth. The drugs affect different parts of the same signaling pathway. The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib were shown in a clinical study of 495 patients with previously untreated, advanced melanoma that demonstrate the BRAF V600 mutation. The government agency said that common side effects of the Cotellic and vemurafenib combination was diarrhea, sensitivity to ultraviolet light, nausea, fever and vomiting. Cotellic could also cause “severe” side effects including heart damage, new skin tumors, retinal detachment, skin rash, liver damage and hemorrhage. Cotellic has received orphan drug designation, for which the FDA has provided incentives that include quicker approval, tax benefits for the developer and seven years’ protection from competition after approval. Conventional drugs typically get five years protection. Orphan drugs are defined as experimental treatments for diseases with fewer than 200,000 patients at any one time.

Using tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound, Canadian doctors have succeeded in delivering chemotherapy deep inside a cancer patient’s brain.

Proving that the procedure works in people is “a big step forward,” said Dr. Pejman Ghanouni, a radiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. “It really opens up a lot to the imagination.”

Most drugs are blocked from entering the brain by the “blood-brain barrier,” which protects against infection, but also makes it tricky to treat brain tumors, diseases like Alzheimer’s, and mental illness.

advertisement

Studies in mice, dogs, pigs, and monkeys have shown that so-called focused ultrasound waves can be used to heat tiny bubbles that then mechanically push open gaps in blood vessels, allowing drugs to leak out into the brain. But the procedure had never been done in people.

On Tuesday, Dr. Todd Mainprize, a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto, announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood-brain barrier in a 56-year-old Canadian woman whose brain tumor, diagnosed six years ago, had recently begun to grow.

Mainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.

The microscopic bubbles — roughly the size of red blood cells — had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.

On Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.

Because the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook — funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation — nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.

Succeeding in getting drugs across the barrier is “a huge achievement” said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.

But it’s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. “If we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,” he said, “it will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.”

Mainprize said the patient, a “remarkable woman,” was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.

In a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. “I want to be a normal housewife … a normal grandma.”",Brain tumor breached with ultrasound in medical first,3,Boston Globe

MONDAY, Nov. 2, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Despite the stereotype that Americans are eating more unhealthful foods that leave them vulnerable to assorted diseases, a new study suggests the opposite may be true.

Harvard researchers report that they found evidence that better diets since 1999 have saved more than one million people from dying prematurely. They also believe improved diets have significantly cut diabetes and heart disease, and even slightly trimmed cancer cases.

The findings paint a surprising picture of American health. But study author Dong Wang, a graduate student with the departments of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, cautioned that it's not time to declare victory in the battle against unhealthy eating.

""The overall American diet is still poor,"" he said. ""Huge room exists for further improvement.""

The researchers wanted to understand how changes in the American diet in the 21st century affected health over time. To get insight into the answer, they analyzed the results of seven health and nutrition surveys including almost 34,000 adults aged 20 and older between 1999 and 2012.

The researchers ranked diets on a healthy eating scale from 0 (poor diet) to 110 (perfect diet). From 1999 to 2012, the overall rating increased, from 40 to 48.

On the positive side, over time, Americans ate more fruit, whole grains, nuts and legumes and polyunsaturated fatty acids, Wang said. They also ate less trans fats, sugar-sweetened beverages and juice, and red and processed meat. But the intake of salt actually went up.

The researchers extrapolated their findings and estimated that the improvement in diets prevented over one million premature deaths and lowered heart disease cases by almost 9 percent, type 2 diabetes cases by nearly 13 percent and cancer cases by just over 1 percent.

According to Wang, the study findings suggest that healthier diets lower the risk of death in a variety of ways. Among other things, improved diets appear to lower the risk of chronic diseases and boost the survival of people who have those conditions. Even a year or two of a better diet appears to have the power to affect survival rates, he said.

The study authors didn't analyze whether their estimates match up to actual death rates in the United States. But other research has pinpointed a decline in death rates in this century, Wang said.

Dr. Sonia Anand, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, praised the study, saying it's ""reasonable"" to link changes in diet to death rates in this way. But, she said, nutrition research like this has limitations because it relies on people's memories of what they ate. As a result, she said, it's crucial to look at a variety of studies and see if trends hold up.

According to study author Wang, trans fats have been almost eliminated from the food supply, so what is needed next is more taxation on sugary drinks and more regulations requiring salt to be reduced in food.

He also said the government can do more to improve diets for the poor, who haven't seen the same level of improvements as other groups. One option, he said, is to increase the number of farmers markets that accept food stamps.

The study is published in the November issue of Health Affairs.

story_reviews_00519,"Doctors-in-training face long, stressful hours, sleepless nights and a high risk of depression and suicidal thoughts, but often are too stoic and time-starved to seek help. A study suggests online self-help behavior therapy could be a solution.

Suicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half-hour online sessions before starting their first year of training, compared with those who got no therapy.

The research involved about 200 medical interns — residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.

An earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Her research group led both studies.

Sarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. She said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help.

""It's very stressful because you're sleep-deprived, you're not eating right ... you're working back-to-back shifts and you're trying to catch up on sleep but you can't,"" Dalechek said. She was not involved in the study.

Dalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web-based program since it's confidential and requires no appointment. Luckily, her depression subsided when that rotation ended.

Guille said offering web-based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial, if her research results are confirmed in a broader study.

The results were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.

The study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. It used a free online program developed at the National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University in Canberra. Interns who got the sessions were 40 percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help.

The online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. For example, a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of ""I'm not good enough,"" but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about ""how many exams have you passed, to put this failure in a more accurate light,"" Guille said.

The training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure, especially when feeling down.

Previous research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.

Guille said medical students and residents tend to be high-achieving perfectionists, but that they need to learn ""you can't always be perfect in medicine, you have to figure out how to deal with failure.""",Study: New docs' suicidal thoughts eased with online therapy,3,Associated Press

Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR

Each year, nearly three times as many Americans die from suicide as from homicide. More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.

As Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.

""That to me is unacceptable,"" Insel says.

It hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.

An effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide — depression — is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.

That approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.

Lynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness ""is like the pain of having a cancer,"" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts — at times almost monthly.

""When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,"" she says. ""I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in."" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. ""Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,"" she says.

The program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.

Fifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.

Some of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called ""perfect depression care"" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.

The mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.

The plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.

If the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care — cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.

Therapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with ""safety plans.""

Lynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass — it has before.

Before the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.

Today, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. ""There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,"" says Espiritu, ""and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan."" The Henry Ford therapists are trained to break that barrier.

For Lynn, the key was persistence — her therapists', and her own. ""I recall one time with my psychiatrist, who kept trying to encourage me and help me find ways of coping, and I can remember saying, 'I don't believe there's hope, I don't see it, I don't feel it, I need you to hold on to that for me because it's not there,' "" she recalls.

Her therapists never gave up. ""There is no question that the message I got from Day 1 is that they knew they could help me, and they would help me,"" Lynn says. Over the years she's been in group therapy, day treatment, and, when things got bad, the emergency room.

The Henry Ford approach is catching on. A stream of visitors from U.S. health insurers and from the United Kingdom have made site visits. The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has run two zero suicide training academies for teams from health care systems based on the Henry Ford principles. Other health systems have adapted the plan, including Group Health Cooperative in Seattle and the behavioral health provider Centerstone in Tennessee.

Espiritu started work at Henry Ford just as the program was starting, and she remembers the initial staff meetings: ""There was a lot of, 'How can you do this? How can you aim for zero? How can you expect your clinicians to be perfect and follow this protocol?' "" Some people didn't think it could be done, she says, or even attempted.

Still, the health system went ahead, and the rewards were nearly immediate. Henry Ford epidemiologist Brian Ahmedani studies the numbers. In 2009, for those being actively treated for a mental health problem or substance abuse, ""we had a rate of zero per hundred thousand,"" he says. It's crept up to 20 per 100,000 per year, but that's still 80 percent lower than it was when the program began. The rate is five per 100,000 in the organization's general population, which is well below the national average and has remained steady despite an increasing rate of suicide statewide.

Preventing Suicide National Suicide Hotline: (800) 273-8255, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org Suicide Prevention Resource Center: www.sprc.org American Foundation for Suicide Prevention: www.afsp.org National Institute of Mental Health: http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/suicide-prevention

There's reason to think a full-bore effort to treat depression could reduce health costs, because untreated depression is associated with higher medical bills for chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. But there are training costs involved, and the Henry Ford system has had to keep its staffing up to be able to provide care for people who need it.

Officials at Henry Ford say they haven't analyzed the costs. But Centerstone has. The behavioral health provider in Nashville implemented the Henry Ford approach for nearly 200 patients who'd already made a suicide attempt. Reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations over the course of a year resulted in savings of more than $400,000.

Why push for zero, rather than just a reduction? ""Because if you say we're OK with five a year, one of those might be your brother or your friend,"" says Espiritu. ""We aim for zero because it reminds all of us of what we would want for ourselves."" Maybe it is not possible, she says. But it is a goal.

And as for Lynn, she doesn't consider herself cured. She says with the treatment she's received at Henry Ford, she's learned to live, even thrive, with bipolar disease. And she's alive. That, she says, makes her a big success story.",What Happens If You Try To Prevent Every Single Suicide?,4,Depression
story_reviews_00521,"Approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus — called Imlygic , which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab — is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors.

Viruses are usually thought of as agents of disease. But for the first time, scientists are poised to bring to the US market a virus that can help thwart cancer, a development that could herald a new age of viral therapies.

In clinical trials, it has helped some cancer patients achieve remission with few of the nasty side effects common to existing treatments. And as the first tumor-killing virus to receive the FDA’s blessing, Imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies.

Advertisement

“This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “The field is exploding, and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use.”

Imlygic is part of a new group of immune-stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed. One involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors, while another, based on a version of the common cold virus, is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer.

Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around 10,000 people per year in the United States. In a trial of 436 patients with the disease, 16 percent of participants who received Imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months, compared with just 2 percent of those who received an older immune-boosting drug. Among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs, the response rate was better — 33 percent.

“It’s a low-toxicity treatment, and for the right patients you see quite stunning results,” said Robert Coffin, a virologist who created Imlygic at BioVex, the Woburn-based company he founded.

In 2011, the California biotech giant Amgen bought BioVex — and the rights to Imlygic, known generically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC — in a deal worth up to $1 billion. Amgen will charge patients $65,000 for a course of treatment, which analysts said is in line with expectations.

Advertisement

“These days in oncology we’ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen & Company. “And Amgen’s not a company that likes to price gouge.”

Schmidt said Imlygic’s market potential as a standalone drug is “very, very modest. It’s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, where we think there’s a little more of a commercial opportunity, but we still need to see more data.”

Imlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery.

Sue Bohlin, a retired small-business owner in Farmingdale, N.J., is one of those patients. She received the viral therapy in early 2011 after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast.

“The first time I took it, I got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever, but only for six or eight hours,” said Bohlin, now 62. “After that, there were no side effects.”

Such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. Aside from chills and fever, the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation.

Bohlin’s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks, but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared. In a last-ditch effort meant to jump-start Bohlin’s immune system, they injected her on consecutive weeks. The tumors started shrinking in the following weeks, and about three months later they were gone.

“I think we’re on the cusp of potentially curing patients” with these viruses and other immune therapies, said Dr. Howard Kaufman, chief surgical officer of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and a lead researcher on Bohlin’s trial. “But short of that, this might be like diabetes, where we can control it and people live normal lives.”

Imlygic is based on a form of the herpes simplex virus that commonly causes cold sores. It is genetically altered to replicate only in tumor cells while also producing a protein that activates T-cells, the search-and-destroy specialists of the immune system. Those T-cells pick up melanoma cells’ molecular scent and hunt them down before going off in search of tumor cells hiding elsewhere in the body.

Advertisement

“This wakes up the immune system and says, ‘Hey! Active infection here, come check this out!’ ” said Dr. Antonio Chiocca, chairman of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

In many of the newer experiments, researchers are combining cancer-killing viruses like Imlygic with other immune-activating agents known as checkpoint inhibitors. These therapies typically open gateways that tumors have used to block immune cells.

In one small study of 19 advanced melanoma patients treated with both Imlygic and a checkpoint inhibitor called Yervoy, nearly half of the patients responded. “It’s nothing short of dramatic,” said Dr. Jason Chesney, an oncologist at the University of Louisville, who is involved in running a larger, follow-up study of this combination approach.

John O’Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic. More than 20 years ago, a dermatologist told him not to worry about the two tan, irregularly shaped spots near his clavicle. Three years ago, however, he noticed a small raised area on one of them.

Surgeons removed the melanoma, but it returned last year under his arm and in his lung. O’Donnell, who is 67, started the combination therapy shortly thereafter, then stopped taking Yervoy after developing severe diarrhea, a common side effect of the treatment.

But he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared. The nodule under his arm also grew small enough to be removed by surgery.

Through it all, O’Donnell remained healthy enough to achieve one of his primary goals: to continue to lead Tuesday Bingo night at a local senior center without the residents discovering his condition.

“I know it sounds vain, but I’m too visible, and I’m too close to them,” he said. “They’re old and easily upset, and I can’t look sick.”

Earlier this month, a new scan revealed shadows that could be signs of melanoma. “My doctor isn’t convinced, though, so she said we’ll just sit and wait,” O’Donnell said. “Even if it is something, there are other things to try.”

story_reviews_00522,"Fat was the food villain these past few decades but sugar is quickly muscling in to take its place. As rates of sugar-related disorders such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease climb, many experts believe that when Americans rid themselves of fat, they simply replaced it with sugar in all its forms.

But proving that the rise of the chronic diseases was actually linked to higher sugar consumption is a challenge. Dr. Robert Lustig, from the department of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, who has made a name for himself publishing books and research addressing the question of sugar’s effects on the body, wanted clearer answers. Now, in a paper published Tuesday, he and his colleagues believe they have come up with the definitive evidence that sugar, as Lustig says, “is toxic.”

In most lab studies, the doses of sugar that scientists test are quite high; they want to see what the effect is quickly and, depending on the research, they may not have time to wait to study the more gradual effects that might emerge. And in studies where people reduce the amount of sugar they eat, for instance, those people end up eating fewer calories overall, so it’s difficult to know whether any changes are due to the removal of sugar or to the drop in calories.

Lustig and his colleagues think they’ve produced the “hard and fast data that sugar is toxic irrespective of its calories and irrespective of weight.”

Lustig’s confidence comes from the unique study, described in Obesity, of 43 Hispanic or African-American children aged eight to 18 years old. He collected detailed food questionnaires from each of the adolescents to get an idea of the average amount of calories they ate per day, then designed a special menu for each of them for nine days that matched the total numbers of calories they would normally eat. The only difference in the nine-day diet was that most of the sugar the children ate was replaced by starch — the overall number of calories remained the same. The children weighed themselves daily, and if they were losing weight, they were told to eat more of the provided food in order to keep their weight the same throughout the study.

“Everything got better,” says Lustig. Some of the children went from being insulin resistant, a precursor state to developing diabetes, in which the body’s insulin levels can no longer keep up with the pace of breaking down sugar that’s coming in from the diet, to insulin sensitive.

“We took chicken teriyaki out, and put turkey hot dogs in. We took sweetened yogurt out, and put baked potato chips in. We took pastries out and put bagels in,” says Lustig. “So there was no change in [the children’s] weight and no change in calories.”

After nine days of having their total dietary sugar reduced to 10% of their daily calories, however, they showed improvements in all of these measures. Overall, their fasting blood sugar levels dropped by 53%, along with the amount of insulin their bodies produced since insulin is normally needed to break down carbohydrates and sugars. Their triglyceride and LDL levels also declined and, most importantly, they showed less fat in their liver.

Because some of the children lost weight, to convince themselves that the effects weren’t due to the small amount of weight that some of the children lost, Lustig and his team compared those who lost weight to those who didn’t during the study, and found similar improvements in both groups.

“Up until now, there have been a lot of correlation studies linking sugar and metabolic syndrome,” says Lustig. “This is causation.”

The diet he provided the children isn’t considered ideal from a health perspective — starches are still a considerable source of calories and can contribute to weight gain. But Lustig relied on the starches to prove a point in a scientific study — that the effect sugar has on the body goes beyond anything connected to its calories and to weight. “I’m not suggesting in any way, shape or form that we gave them healthy food,” he says. “We gave them crappy food, shitty food, processed food — and they still got better. Imagine how much even better they would have gotten if we didn’t substitute and took the sugar out. Then they would have gotten even better yet. That’s the point.”

MORE: The Trouble With Sugar Free Kids

Not everyone is convinced that the results definitely prove sugar, and not weight loss, is the culprit, however. Susan Roberts, professor of Nutrition, USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University notes that because some of the children lost weight, it’s still possible that shedding the pounds helped their metabolic measures to improve. She also points out that the children self-reported their initial diet, which can often be inaccurate. “We know that a healthy diet and weight loss cause good metabolic changes, and although this study tries to attribute its effects to low fructose, in fact it is impossible to do that because of the study design.”

Some experts are concerned for other reasons. They’re worried that the findings may shift attention away from what they consider to be the more fundamental issue — that overall, we’re eating too much. “Too much calorie intake is still the biggest problem,” says Dr. Mark Corkins, professor of pediatrics at University of Tennessee Health Science Center and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition. He notes that the study involved children who were obese already and consuming too many calories. “It’s an important study, and the facts coming out of it are very important. It means we need to look at sugars, and at the type of sugars and sugar intake. But I worry that people are going to hang everything on this when we still need to reduce consumption.”

Lustig hopes that won’t happen as more data emerges that details how sugar is altering the body in unhealthy ways outside of its caloric contribution. That wasn’t the subject of the current paper, but he promises follow up studies based on this work that will address that. This study does hint however, at what might be happening. While there has been a lot of attention on the presence of belly fat and its connection to metabolic syndrome, the fact that the children saw improvements in the amount of fat in their liver suggests that might be an important way that sugar is contributing to chronic disease. Obese children and those with diabetes often suffer from fatty liver, a condition normally associated with alcohol abuse but increasingly common among non-drinkers who gain excessive amounts of weight.

This new view of sugar could change the advice that doctors and government health officials give about eating the sweet stuff. Lustig’s hope is that the information is considered as the U.S. Department of Agriculture finalizes its latest Dietary Guidelines, expected by the end of the year, which delineate recommendations for what, and how much of different types of foods and nutrients Americans should eat.

Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.

Of the many embarrassing health statistics in this country, the huge number of unwanted pregnancies is perhaps the easiest to rectify. Nearly half the pregnancies among American women are unintended — unwanted now or within the next two years. And among sexually active teenagers and young adults, the rate of unplanned pregnancy is even higher.

Fully 43 percent of these pregnancies follow incorrect or inconsistent uses of contraception. Of course, some couples fail to use any contraception, but others rely on contraceptive methods that have significant failure rates even when properly used.

These facts prompted a committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists this month to urge its members to introduce women of all ages to the most effective and underused methods of reversible contraception: IUDs and hormonal implants. Once inserted, these long-acting methods remove the risk of patient error when a sexually active woman wishes to avoid pregnancy. Their effectiveness rivals that of sterilization.

In a 2012 study of 7,486 women aged 14 to 45, long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, were shown to be 20 times as effective in preventing pregnancy than the pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring. The risk of an unwanted pregnancy with these other methods was especially high among women under 21, whose rate of unintended pregnancy was nearly double that among older women.

Yet fewer than 10 percent of sexually active women currently rely on long-acting reversible contraception, and a major reason is doctors’ reluctance to recommend them. Only about half of obstetrician-gynecologists offer the implant, the committee said, and many physicians use “overly restrictive criteria” when deciding whether to recommend an IUD, especially for adolescents and women who have not yet been pregnant.

Greater LARC use can reduce birthrates among adolescents and, for women of all ages, a reliance upon abortion to prevent unwanted births, the experts wrote in the October issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Furthermore, the higher upfront costs of LARC methods are no longer an impediment for women with insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act. Megan L. Kavanaugh, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health, said in an interview that “all new insurance plans obtained through the act’s exchanges fully cover all contraceptive methods without any co-payments or other out-of-pocket costs.” Title X family planning clinics and Planned Parenthood clinics are more likely than other sources to offer LARC methods, she said.

In a paper published two years ago, European experts predicted that “after decades of dominance by ‘the Pill,’ it is likely that in the future, long-acting reversible contraceptives will become the first-line contraceptive option, owing to their superior contraceptive effectiveness in real-life use, cost effectiveness as well as their established safety profile.”

Here is a summary of the advantages of LARCs, listed by the committee:

■ They are independent of the sex act and do not depend on the user’s motivation and reliability.

■ Compared with other reversible methods, they are more effective and have higher rates of continued use and user satisfaction.

■ There is no need to get frequent supplies and no additional costs once they are inserted, making them highly cost effective.

■ There are few contraindications for their use, and fertility returns quickly after removal.

Furthermore, the committee stated, “almost all women are appropriate candidates” for the LARC methods currently available. They are an implant that slowly releases the hormone etonogestrel over a period of three years, and four IUDs: the copper T that can be used for up to 10 years, and three IUDs containing the hormone levonorgestrel (two approved for use up to three years, and one approved for up to five years).

In real-world use, these methods are associated with a one-year pregnancy rate of less than one per 100 women. In contrast, women using the pill, patch or vaginal ring face an annual pregnancy risk of 9 percent; the diaphragm is associated with a 12 percent pregnancy rate, and with condoms, cervical caps and sponges, the rate is 18 percent.

“While there is no one best contraceptive method for every woman or every couple, women should have access to all methods and should know how effective the LARCs are,” Dr. Kavanaugh said.

The etonogestrel implant is a small plastic rod resembling a matchstick that is inserted under the skin in the upper arm. The hormone, a form of progesterone, prevents ovulation and thickens the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Though the implant can remain in place and effective for three years, it can also be removed sooner if, for example, a woman decides she wants to become pregnant. Typically with the implant, menstrual bleeding diminishes, and after a year, one woman in three stops having periods. However, some women develop longer, heavier periods, and some have increased spotting between periods.

Likewise with the hormonal IUDs. Levonorgestrel, also a progesterone, changes the cervical mucus, blocking the transport of sperm and fertilization of an egg. It also suppresses growth of the uterine lining and thus reduces cramping and heavy menstrual bleeding. Women using it report a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss.

The copper IUD does not contain hormones. Rather, the copper is toxic to sperm, preventing them from fertilizing an egg. Because it also prevents a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, the copper IUD can serve as emergency contraception for up to five days following unprotected intercourse.

Both the implant and IUD can be used by women who are breast-feeding, as well as those who cannot take estrogen. There are few contraindications; nearly all women are eligible for an implant or IUD, according to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Unlike early IUDs no longer in use, “modern IUDs do not carry an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease after the first 20 days following insertion,” Dr. Brooke Winner and her colleagues wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine. With both implants and IUDs, fertility returns quickly as soon as the devices are removed.

Common side effects include irregular bleeding during the first few months following the insertion of an implant or IUD. The latter is also associated with some cramping at the time of insertion.

(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s approved Keytruda lung cancer treatment provided superior overall survival to chemotherapy in a late-stage study of patients with advanced disease whose tumors produce a protein called PD-L1 associated with increased risk of the disease.

The U.S. drugmaker on Monday said patients taking the approved 2 milligram dosage of Keytruda and those taking an experimental 10 milligram dose had longer overall survival compared with those taking docetaxel, a standard treatment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.

Patients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said. Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival.

Safety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary “topline” information from the results.

More detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug’s package insert label.

U.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda’s safety and effectiveness.

Keytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient’s own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.

story_reviews_00525,"Portable gluten tester from 6SensorLabs. 6SensorLabs

Restaurants, office parties, potlucks, meals while traveling -- they're a minefield for people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity who can suffer from stomach pain and upset, swollen joints, and other debilitating health problems when they ingest even a little bit of gluten.

The maker of a new handheld gluten-detecting device hopes to help make eating outside of a gluten-sensitive individual's own kitchen safer and easier.

The company, 6SensorLabs, has started taking pre-orders for the device it calls Nima, which can test food for gluten and get rapid results, said co-founder and chief technology officer Scott Sundvor.

Nima is not FDA-approved and it's not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a ""consumer"" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said.

""One of the things that we wanted to make sure we distinguish is that we don't see ourselves as a medical device,"" Sundvor told CBS News. ""So we do not need FDA clearance for the device because we are not using it to diagnose or manage disease. We're simply providing a product to help people know what's in their food and guide their habits.""

Gluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or ""test pod"" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.

As a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a ""gluten free"" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.

Nima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. ""Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,"" said Sundvor.

Nima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.

""We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,"" Sundvor said. ""Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it's something we could make happen.""

It costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company's website. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor.

Marilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly.

""Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful."" However, she adds, ""I would never comment on a device that's not FDA-approved.""

She said she's anecdotally aware of a number of ""treatments"" for celiac disease and has heard of gluten sensors, but is skeptical.

As for Nima, Sundvor said, ""We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate.""

He said they have received Nima prototypes and he and his girlfriend, who has celiac disease, are already trying it out.

The company also aims to create similar versions that could test for peanut and dairy allergens, among other problematic ingredients. A Nima app is in the works, too, that he says will let users share information about restaurants and log their results.",Portable gluten test promises to ease dining woes,3,CBS News
story_reviews_00526,"More than a million Americans will undergo hip or knee replacement this year. Doing their due diligence, many will select top-notch orthopedic surgeons, and some will even evaluate the company that makes their implant. Now, researchers in Canada and some highly regarded orthopedic specialists at U.S. hospitals say mounting evidence and clinical experience shows that patients and doctors should consider one more aspect of care often left out of the conversation: Whether it’s appropriate to use a drug called tranexamic acid, or TXA, which is increasingly being viewed as a way to enhance joint replacement surgery by reducing blood loss during these procedures.

A study published last month in the Canadian Journal of Anesthesiology found that administering TXA intravenously to patients undergoing hip and knee replacement surgery reduced the rate of blood transfusion during those procedures by more than 40 percent, without increasing the length of a patient's hospital stay or adverse events, such as heart attack, stroke or blood clot. “The practice of medicine is now catching up to the research on [TXA],"" says Dr. Charles Bush-Joseph, an orthopedic surgeon at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. ""Here at Rush, we’ve been using it for a number of years."" Surgeons administer the drug to prevent the breakdown of clots, or act as a ""clot stabalizer,"" and thereby reduce bleeding and the likelihood a blood transfusion will be needed during surgery. Though blood transfusions are generally considered safe, they still carry risks ranging from allergic reactions to exceedingly rare blood-borne infections.

TXA is widely known as a potential lifesaver, such as on battlefields, where it's used to slow blood loss among soldiers injured in combat. Back in the civilian world, clinicians at medical centers including Saint Marys Hospital, one of Mayo Clinic's hospitals in Rochester, Minnesota, ​also administer the drug to stop patients’ bleeding in cases ranging from automobile crashes to farming accidents, says Dr. Donald Jenkins, ​medical director for the hospital’s Level I Trauma Center.

Jenkins says doctors at St. Marys and elsewhere at Mayo use the drug during elective joint replacement surgery as well, and he says the positive results that Canadian researchers found reflect their experience.

“It supports our practice. We have been using TXA for these precise operations for many years – with what we thought was good success,” Jenkins says. “I would have been very surprised had these results come out some other way.”

He estimates that the cost of the drug administered during surgery is less than $100, and a Canadian researcher puts the price of TXA at $10 per patient there. That compares with upwards of $1,000 or more for a single blood transfusion, Jenkins says. But despite TXA's ability to reduce the need for transfusions, the latest figures show TXA is used in only about 1 in 10 joint replacement surgeries.

Researchers at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto describe the drug, studied in more than 400 patients who underwent hip and knee replacement there, as underutilized at hospitals elsewhere in Canada and the U.S. In a statement, Dr. Greg Hare, an anesthesiologist at St. Michael's and one of the founders of St. Michael's Centre of Excellence for Patient Blood Management, wrote: ​""Other hospitals and surgical centres​​ should consider making TXA mandatory for similar surgeries because it can improve quality of care, decrease the need for blood transfusions and even save money.""

Even so, the Canadian research team​​ still calls for ongoing surveillance of the drug to make sure its use doesn't increase adverse events. All experts say individual risk factors should be considered in determining whether it's appropriate to use the drug that's also sometimes used in non-orthopedic surgeries to slow blood loss, from trauma to cardiac operations.​ “We use it very judiciously in our older patient population, who would be at increased risk of stroke and heart attack, because of underlying cardiovascular disease,” Jenkins says.

Because of the risks associated ​with the drug, which range from the formation of a blood clot in a vein deep in the body, or deep vein thrombosis, to heart attack, Bush-Joseph says some surgeons at Rush remain leery and don’t use it. However, previous research finds a low complication rate when used to slow blood loss during joint replacement procedures. And Bush-Joseph says most orthopedic surgeons at the medical center do use it for elective hip replacements.

Both he and Jenkins say TXA use is discussed with patients, along with other aspects of surgery. “I would say it’s an element of the informed consent,” Bush-Joseph says, adding that most patients seem to be in favor of it, since it reduces the likelihood they’ll need a blood transfusion.","Could an Inexpensive, Underused Drug Reduce Blood Loss During Surgery?",4,U.S. News & World Report
story_reviews_00527,"Doctors praised the study results.

“I’m very favorably impressed they were able to pull this study off so successfully, and it clearly shows the importance of early intervention,” said Dr. William T. Carpenter, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Mary E. Olson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, who has worked to promote approaches to psychosis that are less reliant on drugs, said the combined treatment had a lot in common with Open Dialogue, a Finnish program developed in the 1980s. “These are zeitgeist ideas, and I think it’s thrilling that this trial got such good results,” Dr. Olson said.

In the new study, doctors used the medications as part of a package of treatments and worked to keep the doses as low as possible minimizing their bad effects. The sprawling research team, led by Dr. John M. Kane, chairman of the psychiatry department at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, randomly assigned 34 community care clinics in 21 states to provide either treatment as usual, or the combined package.

The team trained staff members at the selected clinics to deliver that package, and it included three elements in addition to the medication. First, help with work or school such as assistance in deciding which classes or opportunities are most appropriate, given a person’s symptoms. Second, education for family members to increase their understanding of the disorder. And finally, one-on-one talk therapy in which the person with the diagnosis learns tools to build social relationships, reduce substance use and help manage the symptoms, which include mood problems as well as hallucinations and delusions.

For example, some patients can learn to defuse the voices in their head — depending on the severity of the episode — by ignoring them or talking back. The team recruited 404 people with first-episode psychosis, mostly diagnosed in their late teens or 20s. About half got the combined approach and half received treatment as usual. Clinicians monitored both groups using standardized checklists that rate symptom severity and quality of life, like whether a person is working, and how well he or she is getting along with family members.

The group that started on the combined treatment scored, on average, more poorly on both measures at the beginning of the trial. Over two years, both groups showed steady improvement. But by the end, those who had been in the combined program had more symptom relief, and were functioning better as well.The researchers expect to have lowered average doses in the combined program but had not yet finished analyzing that data.",New Approach Advised to Treat Schizophrenia,4,Harms of medical treatment
story_reviews_00528,"Dear Julia: How well do flu shots actually work?

Just about every influential public health figure urges people to get their flu shots each fall as a necessary precaution during influenza season.

So over dinner, I asked a couple of respected evidence-based medicine researchers what they thought of the vaccine. I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.

This posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.

Why the flu vaccine isn't always effective

The flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.

The challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction — based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies — and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.

This may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.

In kids, the highest-quality evidence — a randomized controlled trial — suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.

In adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. ""Depending on the season,"" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, ""you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms."" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.

Jefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.

On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.

That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, ""Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.""

One key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.

In the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lancet study points out, because annual flu shots were recommended for the elderly since the 1960s, it has been unethical to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials where you give only one group the shot in order to compare it with another group that didn't get the vaccine. So, as this Cochrane review notes, it's impossible to draw firm conclusions on the effectiveness of the flu vaccine for those over 65 because the data is so biased and poor.

Again, though, this doesn't mean we should throw away the vaccine. Stanford researcher John Ioannidis told me how he makes sense of this issue after reviewing the evidence: ""Overall the flu vaccine is effective, and it does save lives. I cannot put an exact figure to how many, but it may well be millions of lives. Generally it is safe and rather cheap, so even if the effectiveness is less than optimal sometimes, overall it is a good deal.""

Why people still bother to get the shot

Despite the limited evidence of effectiveness, there are still good reasons why public health experts recommend the shot.

For one, in those years when the WHO guesses correctly which strains will circulate, the shot tends to be a lot more helpful than some of these averages suggest. And the vaccine is overwhelmingly safe. There's also little by way of alternatives. Beyond public health measures (making sure you have good hand hygiene and avoiding the office when you're sick), the flu shot is the best medical intervention we have for preventing infection. So there's little downside with at least some potential benefit. I personally continue to get the flu shot for this reason.

As Roger Baxter, the co-director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, told me, ""Flu vaccines are not a panacea, and do not prevent all cases of flu, even in the best years, when there are no manufacturing problems and the match is perfect."" He continued: ""However, the vaccines provide moderate protection, and can prevent huge numbers of cases of this serious illness. Many studies have shown that the vaccines are very safe, so the benefit-to-risk ratio is high and the cost is relatively low.""

story_reviews_00529,"People with Type 2 diabetes get an earful of grim lectures about their health prospects and endure much hardship to manage their condition well. But new research offers those who do so a rare reward. A glass of wine every day not only won’t hurt, says a new study: It can actually improve cardiac health, help manage cholesterol and foster better sleep.

The new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that compared with a nightly glass of mineral water, a single glass of wine--red or white--offered those with well-managed Type 2 diabetes some benefits.

After two years, those who drank a glass of white wine nightly improved their triglyceride levels compared with those who drank water or red wine.

But red wine’s benefits were far more numerous and more pronounced than those of white wine: Ruby-colored varietals significantly increased participants’ HDL cholesterol--the “good” form of cholesterol that protects against heart disease--by nearly 10% and improved the overall cholesterol profiles of those who got it. Red wine drinkers also saw improvements in their apolipoprotein a1 levels--a measure of lipid metabolism.

Compared with study participants who drank mineral water nightly and those who had a glass of white wine, diabetics who drank a glass of red wine nightly also had fewer symptoms of metabolic syndrome (hypertension, excess abdominal fat, high blood sugar and abnormal cholesterol levels) at the end of two years.

In people without disease, many studies have found that those who consume alcohol in moderation enjoy better health than those who do not consume any alcohol. Many researchers see that effect as an incidental benefit of alcohol itself, and the authors of the latest study set out believing the same.

But in the current study, the superiority of red wine over white wine in improving diabetes patients’ health suggests that alcohol is not the only thing at work here. While red and white wine contain roughly similar levels of alcohol per serving, red wine contains seven times more plant-based phenolic compounds (including resveratrol and quercetin) than does white wine.

Many researchers argue that it would take dozens of bottles of wine a day--hardly moderate consumption--to deliver polyphenols in volumes that could make a difference in health. But the authors of the current study said that future research should explore whether even the modest phenolic concentrations found in a single glass of red wine might offer measurable health benefits.

The American Diabetes Assn. leaves it to individuals to decide whether to consume alcohol in moderation. But many physicians caution those with diabetes about alcohol consumption, which can add calories, complicate glycemic control and derail self-discipline.

The latest study, conducted by researchers in Israel, Sweden, Germany and the United States, is the first randomized control trial to explore the effect of moderate wine consumption--no more than a single five-ounce serving per day--with alcohol abstention over a lengthy period.

Study participants were all alcohol abstainers at the outset of the study. And all maintained a Mediterranean-style diet throughout their participation, ensuring that the consumption of red wine, white wine or mineral water was the principal difference in their diets.

Genetic inheritance also influenced whether and to what extent wine consumption helped. Carriers of a genetic variation that made them slow metabolizers of alcohol saw considerable improvements in their glycemic control when they consumed a glass of red or white wine daily, the study showed. Participants whose genetic profiles identified them as fast ethanol metabolizers saw no such benefit.

story_reviews_00530,"With knee-replacement surgery on the rise, more patients with two bad knees are opting for a controversial procedure that replaces both at the same time.

Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement, as the surgery is known, is a subject of debate among orthopedic surgeons, with conflicting evidence about the risks and benefits. Proponents say it eliminates the need for a second hospital stay and grueling rehabilitation period, reduces time spent under anesthesia and costs less.

Some studies have found no difference in complication rates after bilateral surgery compared with unilateral surgery. A 2013 study in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery estimated the cost of bilateral surgery at $43,401 compared with $72,233 for two separate surgeries staged over time. The study concluded that bilateral surgery is more cost-effective with better outcomes for the average patient than staged procedures for two knees.

But more recent studies have found increased rates of complication such as blood clots that travel to the lung, an increased need for blood transfusions, and a higher risk of death with the bilateral procedure.

The rate of knee replacements in the U.S. almost doubled from 2000 through 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and now exceeds 700,000 procedures a year. The CDC doesn’t break out data, but studies indicate the percentage of patients who had both knees replaced at the same time has risen from less than 4% in 1999 to more than 6% at present.

Simultaneous bilateral procedures can be performed either by two surgeons operating in tandem or by a single surgeon who completes one knee and immediately turns to the other.

Although the average age has dropped for patients getting knee surgery, many also have health issues that can increase the risk of complications. In 2013, a consensus group of experts recommended that surgeons use more restrictive criteria to select patients for double knee replacements and exclude those with high cardiac risks. The majority said patients who aren’t candidates for simultaneous procedures should get a second one no sooner than three months after the first.

“We’ve learned a lot from years of data on who has complication issues,” says Steven Haas, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. The hospital avoids bilateral knee surgery in patients who have any type of heart disease, as well as those with a body mass index of 40 or more. Obese patients often have conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure than can complicate surgery. Typically, Dr. Haas says, he doesn’t perform bilateral surgery in patients over 80, and prefers not to do it in those over 75 unless they are in exceptional health.

For healthy patients in their 50s and 60s, “it’s an elective decision,” Dr. Haas says.

Nicholas Grosso, president of the Centers for Advanced Orthopaedics in Bethesda, Md., performs bilateral surgery in tandem with another surgeon. A typical hospital stay is three days, compared with two days for single-knee surgery. New anesthetic techniques help control pain after surgery, and as many as 40% of his bilateral patients go directly home. Others go to a rehabilitation facility for about a week, which isn’t usually necessary for unilateral patients. Dr. Grosso says overall recovery time is typically the same, with full recovery in about four months.

Ken McLaughlin, 63, had a bilateral knee replacement surgery in October 2014, with Dr. Grosso and a colleague, M. Brian Polsky. Mr. McLaughlin, who was an avid basketball player and volleyball coach, now teaches physical education to developmentally disabled children. Despite several surgeries over the years to repair damage, he had constant pain in both knees. Yet he wanted to put replacement off, he says, “until I couldn’t stand it anymore.”

After consulting with Dr. Grosso, he decided on bilateral surgery. First, he spent several months getting ready by building up strength in his legs and hamstrings.

Mr. McLaughlin, who lives in Laurel, Md., says it “really hurt” at first after surgery but he stopped taking pain medication after two days. After three nights in the hospital, he spent about a week in a rehabilitation clinic and took a leave from work until mid-January, working out twice a day for an hour and walking around his house. He had no complications and works out at the gym three times weekly. “I’m feeling stronger and getting ready to snow ski this winter,” he says.

A study in May in the Journal of Arthroplasty compared cases matched for risks in simultaneous bilateral and unilateral knee surgeries in a database of nearly 44,000 patients. It found no significant difference in the rate of complications including infection, hospital re-admission, or death. But bilateral procedures were associated with increased overall complications and risk of subsequent surgery within 30 days.

Study co-author David Manning, a joint replacement specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and associate professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says he recommends staged procedures over time for patients who need both knees replaced. He doesn’t perform bilateral knee replacements.

“We decided it is not a safe practice, and it adds risk, so we don’t do it,” he says.

Last year, a large study comparing the two types of surgery indicated that bilateral patients were at increased risk of both minor and major in-hospital complications as well as death. The study, published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, included hospital claims data on 24,574 simultaneous bilateral surgeries and 382,496 unilateral procedures.

Surgeon Bryan Springer, a co-author of the study and fellowship director at OrthoCarolina Hip and Knee Center in Charlotte, N.C., says while complication rates are generally low for all knee surgeries, he is “extremely selective” about recommending bilateral surgery. “If you pick your patient appropriately you can do this operation very safely,” he says. Dr. Springer performs bilateral surgery with a team, starting the second knee while the first incision is being closed; if there are safety concerns after the first, he won’t proceed with the second.

Sandra Lynch, a 62-year-old wedding-officiant in Frederick, Md., had trouble with her knees for more than a decade. But with a busy schedule, she didn’t want recovery to take more than four months. Before the procedure, she took a year to exercise, walking daily and building a desk over a disassembled recumbent bike. She had the bilateral knee replacement with Dr. Grosso and Dr. Polsky in December last year.

Afterward, Ms. Lynch was hospitalized for four days. She needed a blood transfusion but was able to manage physical therapy before being transferred to a rehabilitation center for about a week. After bad reactions to narcotic pain medications and an anti-nausea patch, she switched to over-the-counter painkillers. Though she had to use a walker at first, after eight weeks she began to drive and walk without assistance. She is now back to work officiating at weddings and says she has no regrets.

TUESDAY, Oct. 6, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Cancer patients who have ovarian tissue removed and stored for later transplantation have a chance at a successful pregnancy, a new study finds.

Powerful chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer can impair a woman's fertility. This new study shows that ovarian tissue transplants are safe and effective and pose little risk of the cancer coming back, the Danish researchers said.

""This procedure is gaining ground worldwide as an optional fertility treatment for fertile female cancer patients who after cancer treatment most likely will be infertile,"" said lead researcher Dr. Annette Jensen, from the Laboratory of Reproductive Biology at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.

With this procedure, many women who survive cancer should be able to become pregnant and have healthy children, Jensen said.

Of 32 women who had ovarian tissue frozen and transplanted in this study, 10 women -- or 31 percent -- had a child, she said.

Many young cancer patients today can expect to live a normal lifespan. Their focus shifts from survival to quality-of-life, explained senior researcher Dr. Claus Yding Andersen, a professor of human reproductive physiology at the University of Copenhagen. ""Here, fertility is very important to many young women,"" he said.

""The tissue restores ovarian organ function, and women regain menstrual cycles and sex hormone levels that will avoid menopause,"" Andersen added.

Dr. Avner Hershlag, chief of the Center for Human Reproduction at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the new research ""innovative and exciting.""

Simultaneous advances in cancer treatment and reproductive medicine have made these scientific leaps possible, he said.

However, Hershlag said he would like to see a pregnancy rate above 31 percent. ""The pregnancy rate with frozen embryos is close to 50 percent, and results are getting better,"" he said, referring to another option for women hoping for a future pregnancy. ""It remains to be seen which method is better.""

The Danish report was published Oct. 7 in the journal Human Reproduction.

For the study, the researchers reviewed the outcomes of 53 transplantations of thawed ovarian tissue in 41 Danish women. The investigators followed the women for 10 years, looking at ovarian function, fertility and safety.

The women's average age when the tissue was removed and frozen was nearly 30. Average age of the first transplant was 33.

Thirty-two of the women attempted pregnancy. Ten were successful and had at least one child -- 14 children in all.

Eight children were conceived naturally, and six with the help of in vitro fertilization, the researchers reported.

Two women had abortions, one because she was separating from her partner and the other because her breast cancer recurred. Another woman had a miscarriage, the researchers said.

For three of the mothers, more than 10 years had passed since the ovarian tissue transplantation. In six cases, it was more than eight years. And for 15 of the women, transplantation had taken place more than five years earlier, the researchers said.

Although three women had a relapse of their cancer, these relapses did not appear related to the tissue transplantation. And no cancer developed in the transplanted tissue, Jensen said.

""So some of these women will still be able to have more children and avoid menopausal symptoms,"" she said, noting two more pregnancies have been reported to her laboratory since the study's publication.

Not all women are eligible for ovarian tissue transplants, however. ""In particular, we have not performed transplants in patients who have suffered from leukemia, because the ovarian tissue may harbor cancer cells,"" Jensen said.

story_reviews_00532,"Eighteen years ago, math teacher Susan Tesone went from having perfect vision to being so visually impaired she wasn’t able to drive in just four weeks. Tesone, who is now 42, was diagnosed with Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy which is a genetic disease that rapidly clouds a patient’s central vision.

Tesone, whose brother has the condition as well, told FoxNews.com that she sees “through a dense fog.”

“It’s not as though there is a big black spot. Your peripheral vision begins to take over,” she said, adding, “I get a whole image of a whole room, for example, but what I don’t have is clarity.”

Tesone didn’t allow the diagnosis to alter her life plans, and though she was saddened by the news, she was determined to live a successful and fulfilling life.

“You have to decide what accommodations you’re going to make for yourself in your home life and work life and figure them out,” she said.

Tesone began to utilize different tools, from talking computers to magnifiers that project images on to a large screen. These large and bulky gadgets served as a modest improvement to her life but it was her husband who found an item that she said makes her life much more efficient.

Her husband, a computer programmer, was attending a conference and heard about a device called the OrCam, which helps those who are visually impaired. He was able to get one for his wife so she can be part of the beta testing.

“OrCam is a portable intuitive smart camera that someone wears on their glasses,” Bryan Wolynski, an optometrist who promotes OrCam to doctors and trains patients on how to use the device, told FoxNews.com.

“It fits on their own right side temple of their glasses, takes a picture and then speaks to the wearer what it sees,” he said.

The camera, which is about the size of a lighter, is connected by a wire to a power pack that can fit in a pocket or purse. It is activated when a patient points at a subject, or presses a button on the power pack. The camera takes a picture and instantaneously reads what it sees. OrCam can read print on a newspaper or a piece of mail. It also can be trained to recognize a person’s face or any household object.

OrCam costs $3,500, but Wolynski believes the outcome worth the price.

“I have seen a person cry when being able to read for the first time in many years,” he said.

Another ophthalmologist, Dr. Marc Werner, also believes that OrCam is a useful device, but he said there are some drawbacks.

“It doesn’t always get every word exactly correctly, so if you’re reading a long book, it may not be the best way to do it,” he said, adding “but certainly there is nothing out there as far as I know that lets you read a newspaper or get the gist of the story even if it’s going to miss a few words or a few concepts, it’s still far better than what’s out there right now.”

Tesone agrees because of how much more efficient her life is now, both at work and at home. Reading one piece of paper on a magnifier could take her sometimes up to 20 minutes because she almost had to read letter by letter. Now, the OrCam takes about 30 seconds to read, scan and dictate the letter back to her.

“I have time at home with my children because I could just read something and be done. It’s just so amazing to be able to do,” Tesone said.

story_reviews_00533,"Heart researchers have long known that plaques in coronary arteries start out as pimplelike bumps but get waxy and hard and filled with calcium as time passes. Calcium shows up as white flecks in CT scans. The hard plaques are not the dangerous ones — it is the softer ones that rupture and cause a heart attack. But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.

Dr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.

Current guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?

The study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.

It turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.

For example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.",Heart Scan Can Fine-Tune Risk Estimate for Patients Considering Statins,4,Cardiovascular disease
story_reviews_00534,"The GeneSight test result helped prompt Brown’s psychiatrist to switch him to a new drug in June, making Brown, 40, optimistic that there might be a path back to a job, an apartment, and even a new girlfriend. But three weeks later he was suicidal, checking into a mental hospital at his therapist’s urging.

By collecting the former editor’s DNA with a quick cheek swab, a new genetic test retailing at $3,800 would reveal which depression medications Brown would likely respond well to and those he would not.

RUTLAND, Vt. — For the first time in John R. Brown’s two-decade quest for the right medication to make his brain behave, his psychiatrist offered him hope in the form of what seemed like rock-solid science.

“I can’t help but wonder if I should have stuck with the devil I know,’’ Brown now says.

Genetic tests to identify the most effective psychiatric drugs are the hot new technology in the race to create personalized treatments based on people’s DNA. More than 600,000 of these tests have likely been administered in the last three years, based on company websites and research data, to better treat conditions ranging from depression to attention deficit disorder to anxiety. In a nod to the tests’ growing acceptance, the federal Medicare program last year agreed for the first time to pay for the GeneSight test for some depressed patients.

But a review by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found that virtually all the evidence that these psychiatric tests work is based on limited studies funded by the companies themselves or researchers they fund, including all five studies used to promote GeneSight on the company’s website.

The federal government doesn’t require companies to prove that this and thousands of other tests are accurate before marketing and selling them. Unlike drugs, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate them, though that may soon change.

Some of the testing firms’ research practices also raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. For example, California-based Proove Biosciences provides a full-time employee to administer and run a study on the company’s test at a Littleton, Mass., mental health clinic. It pays clinicians for time spent related to the study, a relationship that could give clinicians an incentive to steer patients to the test — and give the company access to insurance reimbursement for those patients.

Patients also cannot find out for themselves if their doctor stands to gain financially by recommending a personalized medicine test. A public federal database created in 2014 to disclose financial relationships between the health care industry and physicians excludes most genetic tests.

“It is the Wild West,’’ said Mildred Cho, associate director at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, who says there is little published evidence on the effectiveness of drug response tests.

Eric Lander, a leader of the Human Genome Project and founding director of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, goes further, saying in a New England Journal of Medicine article earlier this year that the mental health testing company claims are “not harmless and may be quite dangerous.”

In psychiatry, a field hampered by a lack of definitive tests for conditions and treatments alike, the idea of a genetic test to identify the drugs most likely to be effective is particularly appealing as a way to cut down on the trial-and-error approach to medications that many patients face.

And the tests do hold promise. The basic science behind them is built on years of solid research — analyzing an individual’s genetic make-up to determine how they may respond to drugs. GeneSight’s test was developed using technology from the respected Mayo Clinic and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

Officials at Assurex Health, the Ohio-based company that makes GeneSight, stand behind their product. They make no guarantee that GeneSight will lead doctors to pick the right medicine for patients, but they point to company studies that show it more than doubles the odds they will. Plus, the officials note, the test underwent close review by a Medicare contractor before the agency agreed to pay for the tests.

“Patients do better,’’ said Bryan M. Dechairo, senior vice president of medical affairs and clinical development for Assurex. “We continue to do more studies” to show the test’s value.

The amount of money at stake is enormous. Psychiatric conditions affect 1 in 4 adults every year and 1 in 5 teens, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Finding a test to more precisely target treatment could help troubled people find help more quickly, cut down on side effects, and save money. It can also make hundreds of millions of dollars for the test makers, which helps explain why at least 15 companies are now ramping up mental health testing.

“It is so much more than just getting the medications right,’’ said Rachel Scott, vice president of clinical research and operations for Pennsylvania-based test maker Genomind. “It is giving patients the opportunity to step outside the stigma of mental illness, for them to see this is their biology — and give their clinician some objective information.”

But psychiatric genetics remains in its infancy. Aggressive marketing and a lack of regulation of tests that have a thin scientific foundation have raised concerns for some bioethicists.

“The claims of these companies are weak,’’ said Robert Klitzman, a psychiatrist and bioethicist at Columbia University in New York who had a commentary published last week in a mental health journal calling for vigilance in the marketing of genetic mental health tests.

“Conflicts of interest in the field are major problems,” he said.

Payments from test maker

Last fall, the owners of the New England Center for Mental Health in Littleton, an adult and child clinic, were asked to be part of a research study.

California-based Proove Biosciences wanted the center to join a national study, aimed in part at better understanding how its tests benefited adults with mental health conditions.

The company would provide the center with a full-time research assistant stationed in an office behind the reception desk. If a clinician and patient decided a Proove drug metabolism test, which analyzes 69 genetic variants, would be useful, the assistant would take the patient’s DNA with a cheek swab, collect insurance information for Proove to be reimbursed, and administer extensive questionnaires to track how the test worked out over time.

“We wanted to offer our patients a test that could really help them,’’ said Jessica X. Hennessey, director of operations and management at the Center for Mental Health.

The center received a one-time payment of $600 from Proove for training and is allowed to bill $150 for each hour of clinical research service and services rendered by Littleton staff members related to the study, according to Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the center. The Center for Mental Health has billed Proove a little more than $5,600 since then, Corrigan said.

Proove officials and Hennessey said clinicians are never compensated based on the type or number of tests they order, and clinicians do not promote the swab test in any way.

“The tests are only ordered if they are medically necessary,” said Brian Meshkin, Proove’s founder and CEO.

But the close arrangement raises eyebrows among bioethicists because it can lead to the appearance of clinicians ordering the test to receive compensation for the study.

“There is a big set of ethical concerns here,’’ said Columbia’s Klitzman, after being told about the Littleton study. He said those concerns are especially pronounced if doctors have financial incentives and “order tests that have no clear proven benefit.”

Federal officials are growing increasingly concerned about such research-physician arrangements in the genetic testing field. Late last year, a large study that included psychiatric drug response by New Orleans-based Renaissance RX was shut down after Medicare halted payments and began a review. A Rhode Island doctor also sued the company, charging, in part, that Renaissance RX enrolled ineligible people in order to bill insurance.

Meanwhile, the Office of the Inspector General for the US Department of Health and Human Services last year singled out compensation agreements related to research studies in a special fraud alert, noting there were growing cases of doctors receiving improper incentives regarding referrals.

Medicare review

The GeneSight test has gotten the most outside scrutiny among the tests because it faced review by Medicare before the agency agreed to cover it for certain patients with depression.

Medicare contractors were swayed by company-funded studies showing that when these patients took the medications recommended by the test, they had fewer symptoms after eight weeks compared with patients who did not use the test.

“Use of the test to aid in [drug selection] has improved patient responses to treatment by 73 percent . . . these findings support the value of the GeneSight test,’’ according to the coverage decision.

Excitement built in the mental health world that perhaps there was finally a scientific test that could help patients.

Brown heard about the test from his psychiatrist, Susan Gerretson, of the Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region, and found out his federal insurance would pay for it.

While his medications of lithium for bipolar disorder and the antidepressant Effexor were holding him steady, he was hardly in a happy place.

“I figured, Why not try it?” he said.

“I figured, Why not try it?” John R. Brown said. Caleb Kenna for The Boston Globe

Of the five medications the test suggested he would respond best to, Brown had never tried two of them. After several months of discussion, Gerretson put him on one of those drugs, Fetzima.

Even without the new drug, Brown says it was a challenging time: He turned 40, his old girlfriend called, and he quarreled with his mother.

But Fetzima “was a factor’’ in his breakdown, he believes. He paused during an interview this summer at the Brattleboro Retreat, a mental health treatment center, and gave a wry smile. “It sure didn’t help.”

Gerretson declined to talk specifically about Brown’s case, citing privacy concerns. But she said in an e-mail that she believes GeneSight can be helpful as long as a doctor fully understands a patient’s history and conducts his or her own research.

“I never believe what sales representatives try to sell me,’’ she wrote.

Yet critics of these tests say it’s impossible for doctors — or anyone else — to truly evaluate many of the tests. GeneSight’s proprietary formula for interpreting genetic information has never been independently assessed. The test examines genes well-known to play a role in antidepressant response, but it adds others not suppported by the same level of evidence, some researchers say.

Robert Howland, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote a paper last year concluding that the makers of the GeneSight test have overstated the findings of their studies, making outside review more urgent.

“Independent assessment . . . of the GeneSight test is necessary to overcome the appearance of bias,’’ said Howland.

But Assurex’s Dechairo said if the company didn’t do the research, no one would. The company has 12 ongoing studies not only for depression, he said, but for bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia and other medical issues.

To reach patients, the company markets its tests to the psychiatry world, in part by paying psychiatrists and nurses to talk favorably about their test to peers. The practice is not new in medicine, but, unlike the drug industry, most genetic test makers need not disclose which doctors they pay because they’re not FDA-regulated.

Catherine Poulos, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at East End Mental Health in Hampton Bays, N.Y., advertises the GeneSight test on her website, saying it allows her practice “to use the right drug at the right dose.” But nowhere does it say on the site that she is paid to speak favorably to peers about the test; a patient would have to look at her Linkedin profile to see that. Poulos declined to speak on the record to NECIR.

But some consultants who use the tests say they do so because they believe in it, not because they get paid.

“It adds clarity,’’ said Chris Bojrab, a psychiatrist and president of Indiana Health Group, a large behavioral health practice and a GeneSight consultant. He discloses his financial relationship with GeneSight on his website.

An FDA loophole

The FDA loophole that allows unregulated tests on the market dates back more than three decades to when the FDA began regulating diagnostic tests. At the time, the agency exempted what was then a small group of tests that were developed, manufactured, and used in a single lab, such as in a hospital.

Starting in the mid-2000s, for-profit companies have used the exemption to develop thousands of complex genetic tests now in the marketplace without FDA review.

The FDA announced plans last year to regulate these tests over the next nine years. However, there is no timeline to finalize the rules, according to an FDA spokeswoman, and the process is likely to take years.

Commercial labs and academic institutions are pushing back against regulation, arguing the rules will stifle innovation and delay life-saving tests getting to patients. Regardless of the outcome of the fight, many academic scientists say this new era in testing needs independent study. They question if the tests are adding unnecessary costs to health care.

“These companies look at a very small subset of a very large number of factors’’ that go into treating patients, said Bruce Cohen, a psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School and director of the program for neuropsychiatric research at McLean Hospital in Belmont. “People are making decisions based on unproven tests.”

Brown’s decision was to go back to old medications. For him, the GeneSight test felt more like “a cool piece of science fiction” than a breakthrough. Still living in his mother’s house, he remains determined to rebuild his life.

“I’m going to have to figure it out another way,” he said.","Genetic tests for psychiatric drugs spur hope, doubts",5,Boston Globe

This discovery was made by researchers at Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina, and presented at the 2015 Experimental Biology conference in Boston.

""Through our research, we were able to show that dried plums promote retention of beneficial bacteria throughout the colon, and by doing so they may reduce the risk of colon cancer,"" Nancy Turner, study author and professor in the nutrition and food science department of Texas A&M University, said in a press release.

Turner and colleagues examined how dried plums' antioxidants neutralized the type of changes that occur when cancerous cells damage the DNA. They found that when rats were fed a controlled diet of dried plums, two major phyla of bacteria in the gut – Bacteroidetes and Frimicutes – increased, without negatively impacting other areas of the colon.

They also observed that those who were on the dried plum diet showed reduced numbers of aberrant crypts, which are early signs of precancerous lesions considered to be a red flag for future cancer.

When considering where to give birth, most parents-to-be and doctors in Western nations believe a hospital is the best place.

Not so Jean Stevens, 32, who chose to deliver two children at home in the U.K. She says her two labors were nearly pain-free.

“From my point of view the best place to give birth is where you’re most relaxed,” says Ms. Stevens, who was 29 when she surprised friends and family with her desire for a home birth. She had her second baby at home in Elm, some 100 miles north of London, when she was 31.

Childbirth at home is usually considered more risky than in the hospital for both mother and baby in high-risk or first-time pregnancies. And even with low-risk pregnancies, some expectant parents have no interest in giving birth at home, either because of limited pain relief options or reluctance to be too far from lifesaving medical care if it is needed.

Yet some expectant parents want to explore the option of home birth but feel it is an uphill battle to do so. “Women need to be respected more and supported in their choice,” says Ms. Stevens, who is trying to figure out a way to deliver her third child at home even though the local hospital no longer offers a home birth option.

This spring the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a U.K. advisory entity for the National Health Service often known as NICE, issued guidance stating that home births are safer than hospital births for women who are having their second or later child with a low-risk pregnancy.

The NICE statement is thought to be the first time a major health-care authority has asserted that home births may be superior to hospital births for these mothers, with no evidence of increased risk to the baby, according to Neel Shah, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School who wrote a recent commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine about the NICE guidelines.

“What was so paradigm-shifting about the NICE guidelines, they emphasize the dangers of over-intervention,” says Dr. Shah. “That’s huge.”

The guidelines have prompted questions within the U.S. medical community about whether home births really are riskier than hospital births. Some are asking whether the U.S. approach to delivery could be improved using some of the strategies employed in the U.K. and elsewhere, including the Netherlands and parts of Canada.

The rate of pregnancy-related deaths among U.S. women has been increasing steadily for decades for reasons experts don’t understand—though the absolute numbers remain small. The numbers include deaths of women during their pregnancy or within one year of pregnancy termination. One factor could be the rise in chronic conditions like diabetes, which may put women at higher risk of complications while pregnant. A rise in the number of cesarean sections may be related but is unlikely to be the primary driver, experts say. Home births, which make up less than 1% of deliveries in the U.S., aren’t to blame, experts say.

Midwives generally attend home births while obstetricians attend hospital births. Medical interventions such as an epidural injection or a caesarean section typically are performed only in a hospital. Gas and other types of pain medication are sometimes given during home births.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has reached a different conclusion about home births. “We believe that a hospital or a birth-center is the safest place to undertake delivery,” Jeffrey Ecker, chairman of the obstetrics practice for the group, said in an interview. Birth centers are small health-care facilities, often led by midwives, which try to offer a more homelike environment for giving birth. Some are independent facilities while others are affiliated with or work alongside hospitals.

“In part because of differences between health-care systems, we aren't yet ready to promote or recommend the option of home birth in the United States as they are in the United Kingdom,” Dr. Ecker said.

Midwives in the U.K. tend to be employees of the national health-care system, and work with obstetricians to share patient records and make plans for care. And so if a patient has to be transferred from home to the hospital during childbirth, it is more likely to happen smoothly and without professional rivalry, says Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives in London.

“One of the riskiest times for a woman isn't when things are going normally and she’s in her chosen place, but the point when she needs to transfer,” Ms. Warwick says. “Handover points are where things go wrong.”

Underpinning the updated NICE guidelines is a large U.K. study called Birthplace, which studied more than 64,000 women who gave birth between April 2008 and 2010. Initial results, published in 2011 in the journal BMJ, indicated that among low-risk women who chose to have a second or later child at home, there were fewer interventions and complications, such as cesarean sections, forceps delivery, infections and hemorrhage compared with hospital births, while the health of babies didn’t differ.

Among women having their first babies at home, however, the outcomes for women were better but the babies had a statistically significant increase in risks of experiencing a complication. The absolute risk of something happening was very small.

A large Canadian study of nearly 8,000 home births in British Columbia between 2000 and 2004 compared them to matched cases of hospital births and found results similar to the U.K. results, says Michael Klein, an emeritus professor of family practice and pediatrics at the University of British Columbia, and an author on the paper.

Many clinicians focus on relative risk (the difference between two outcomes) rather than absolute risk (how likely an event is actually to occur). Relative risk can make a problem seem greater than its actual impact in the population, says Eugene Declercq, a professor of community health sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. One might state a certain outcome is twice as likely as another, yet it occurs at a rate of 2 in 1,000 versus 1 in 1,000.

Some NICE recommendations could be more readily adopted in the U.S., said Dr. Ecker, who also is a high-risk obstetrician and professor at Harvard Medical School. These points include establishing more birth centers alongside hospitals, using more midwifery care in low-risk deliveries and placing appropriate limitations on technology in labor and delivery.

Heidi Pollard-Hermann, a 32-year-old labor and delivery nurse in Portland, Ore., chose to have her daughter at home four months ago. Ms. Pollard-Hermann says she wanted to avoid a caesarean section and knew that the chance of intervention would be higher at the hospital. She also wanted to experience labor. Because there was a major hospital 10 minutes away by car, she felt sure she would be able to make the transfer if problems arose.

With recommendations from friends, she found an experienced certified nurse midwife who had a relationship with a local hospital. “Sometimes there’s a lot of fear of birth in our culture,” says Ms. Pollard-Hermann. Labor, she says, “was amazing.” She gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

story_reviews_00537,"The test accurately identified a group of women whose cancers are so likely to respond to hormone-blocking drugs that adding chemo would do little if any good while exposing them to side effects and other health risks. In the study, women who skipped chemo based on the test had less than a 1 percent chance of cancer recurring far away, such as the liver or lungs, within the next five years.

Many women with early-stage breast cancer can skip chemotherapy without hurting their odds of beating the disease — good news from a major study that shows the value of a gene-activity test to gauge each patient's risk.

''You can't do better than that,'' said the study leader, Dr. Joseph Sparano of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.

An independent expert, Dr. Clifford Hudis of New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, agreed.

''There is really no chance that chemotherapy could make that number better,'' he said. Using the gene test ''lets us focus our chemotherapy more on the higher risk patients who do benefit'' and spare others the ordeal.

The study was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. Results were published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine and discussed at the European Cancer Congress in Vienna.

The study involved the most common type of breast cancer — early stage, without spread to lymph nodes; hormone-positive, meaning the tumor's growth is fueled by estrogen or progesterone; and not the type that the drug Herceptin targets. Each year, more than 100,000 women in the United States alone are diagnosed with this.

The usual treatment is surgery followed by years of a hormone-blocking drug. But many women also are urged to have chemo, to help kill any stray cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast and could seed a new cancer later. Doctors know that most of these women don't need chemo but there are no great ways to tell who can safely skip it.

A California company, Genomic Health Inc., has sold a test called Oncotype DX since 2004 to help gauge this risk. The test measures the activity of genes that control cell growth, and others that indicate a likely response to hormone therapy treatment.

Past studies have looked at how women classified as low, intermediate or high risk by the test have fared. The new study is the first to assign women treatments based on their scores and track recurrence rates.

Of the 10,253 women in the study, 16 percent were classified as low risk, 67 percent as intermediate and 17 percent as high risk for recurrence by the test. The high-risk group was given chemotherapy and hormone-blocking drugs. Women in the middle group were randomly assigned to get hormone therapy alone or to add chemo. Results on these groups are not yet ready — the study is continuing.

But independent monitors recommended the results on the low-risk group be released, because it was clear that adding chemo would not improve their fate.

After five years, about 99 percent had not relapsed, and 98 percent were alive. About 94 percent were free of any invasive cancer, including new cancers at other sites or in the opposite breast.

''These patients who had low risk scores by Oncotype did extraordinarily well at five years,'' said Dr. Hope Rugo, a breast cancer specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, with no role in the study. ''There is no chance that for these patients, that chemotherapy would have any benefit.''

Advertisement

Dr. Karen Beckerman, a New York City obstetrician diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011, said she was advised to have chemo but feared complications. A doctor suggested the gene test and she scored very low for recurrence risk.

''I was convinced that there was no indication for chemotherapy. I was thrilled not to have to have it,'' and has been fine since then, she said.

Mary Lou Smith, a breast cancer survivor and advocate who helped design the trial for ECOG, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, which ran it, said she thought women ''would be thrilled'' to skip chemo.

''Patients love the idea of a test'' to help reduce uncertainty about treatment, she said. ''I've had chemotherapy. It's not pretty.''

The test costs $4,175, which Medicare and many insurers cover. Others besides Oncotype DX also are on the market, and Hudis said he hopes the new study will encourage more, to compete on price and accuracy.

''The future is bright'' for gene tests to more precisely guide treatment, he said.","Some with early-stage breast cancer can skip chemo, study says",5,Associated Press

A mind-altering drug called ketamine is changing the way some doctors treat depression.

Encouraged by research showing that ketamine can relieve even the worst depression in a matter of hours, these doctors are giving the drug to some of their toughest patients. And they're doing this even though ketamine lacks approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating depression.

""It became clear to me that the future of psychiatry was going to include ketamine or derivatives of ketamine,"" says David Feifel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, who began administering the drug to patients in 2010.

Ketamine was developed as an anesthetic and received FDA approval for this use in 1970. Decades later, it became popular as a psychedelic club drug. And in 2006, a team from the National Institute of Mental Health published a landmark study showing that a single intravenous dose of ketamine produced ""robust and rapid antidepressant effects"" within a couple of hours.

Since then, thousands of depressed patients have received ""off-label"" treatment with ketamine.

One of those patients is Paul, 36, who lives in San Diego and is a patient of Dr. Feifel. We're not using his last name to protect his medical privacy.

Paul's depression began with anxiety. ""I was an extremely anxious child,"" he says. ""I would always make choices based on fear. My life was really directed by what was the least fearful thing that I could do.""

As Paul grew up, his extreme anxiety led to major depression, which could leave him unable to get out of bed for days. ""I lived in pain,"" he says.

Paul managed to get through college and a stint in the Peace Corps. But most days were a struggle. And Paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief.

He tried just about every drug used for depression, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and even electroconvulsive therapy, which induces a brief seizure. But nothing worked — at least not for very long.

Paul says he was increasingly haunted by ""this comforting thought of pressing a cold gun against my forehead where I felt the pain the most.""

Then one day, while investigating depression on the Internet, Paul discovered the research on ketamine. ""It was clear to me that this was real,"" he says.

Ordinarily, there would have been no legal way for Paul to get ketamine. He didn't qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts. And doctors usually won't prescribe a mind-altering club drug to someone with a mental illness.

But the studies of ketamine have produced results so dramatic that some doctors, including Feifel, are bypassing the usual protocols.

By the time Feifel began hearing about ketamine, he had become frustrated with existing depression drugs. Too often, he says, they just weren't helping his patients.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of David Feifel Courtesy of David Feifel

A major study on antidepressant medication published in 2008 seemed to confirm his suspicions. It found that current antidepressants really aren't much better than a placebo.

Many psychiatrists criticized that study. But not Feifel. ""I was kind of like, I'm not surprised,"" he says. ""These really don't seem like powerful tools.""

Feifel remembers feeling ""professionally embarrassed"" that psychiatrists didn't have something better to offer their depressed patients. Something like ketamine.

He knew the drug had risks. It could be abused. It could produce hallucinations. And it didn't have the FDA's OK for treating depression.

But he also knew that doctors had a lot of experience with ketamine. It's been used for decades as an anesthetic that can rapidly stop pain without affecting vital functions like breathing. And ketamine's safety record is so good that it's often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone.

So in 2010, Feifel decided he wanted to offer low doses of the drug to some patients. The decision put him at odds with some prominent psychiatrists, including Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""While the science is promising, ketamine is not ready for broad use in the clinic,"" Insel wrote in his blog a few months ago.

""There are a lot of pundits who remain skeptical or feel we need to research this ad infinitum before it's ready, which doesn't make sense to me,"" Feifel says. It's hard to take the wait-and-see approach when you're treating patients who are desperate for help, he adds.

Paul was one of those desperate patients when he was referred to Feifel in March of 2014. The referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas, Feifel says.

And Paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine. ""If there was even a 1 percent chance that this worked, it would have been worth it to me,"" he says. ""My life was hanging in the balance.""

And for Paul, the benefits of ketamine became obvious soon after one of his early injections.

""I remember I was in my bathroom and I literally fell to my knees crying because I had no anxiety, I had no depression,"" he says

For the past year, Paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks. He feels an altered sense of reality for an hour or two after getting the drug. The effect on depression and anxiety, though, lasts more than a month.

Ketamine doesn't always work that well, Feifel says. After treating more than 100 patients, he's beginning to understand the drug's limitations.

One is that its ability to keep depression at bay can fade pretty quickly. Feifel recalls one patient whose depression would disappear like magic after a dose of ketamine. But ""we could never get it to sustain beyond maybe a day,"" he says.

Also, ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely. Feifel charges about $500 for each injection and $1,000 for an intravenous infusion, which takes effect more quickly. Insurers don't cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental.

Even so, ketamine clinics are popping up around the country and they have already treated thousands of patients willing and able to pay out of pocket. Some of the clinics are run by psychiatrists. Others have been started by entrepreneurial anesthesiologists and emergency room doctors, who are familiar with ketamine but may not know much about depression.

""We've seen ketamine clinics open up as pure business models,"" Feifel says. ""I'm a little bit concerned about that.""

Feifel fears something bad will happen to a depressed patient at one of these clinics. And that could set back efforts to make the drug more widely available.",Club Drug Ketamine Gains Traction As A Treatment For Depression,3,Depression

Agitation and aggression are common in Alzheimer’s patients, and there is no known safe and effective treatment. Now researchers report that a combination drug already in use for treating certain neurological problems may be a better remedy.

Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant commonly found in over-the-counter cough medicines, and quinidine is a drug used to control heart rhythm disorders. In combination, they are used to treat pseudobulbar affect, a neurological disorder involving involuntary crying or other emotional displays.

The scientists randomized 152 Alzheimer’s patients to a 10-week course of dextromethorphan-quinidine and 127 to placebo. Researchers then rated them using a well-validated scale that measures aggression and agitation. The study is in the Sept. 22 issue of JAMA.

Aggression scores declined to 3.8 from 7.1 in the dextromethorphan-quinidine group and to 5.3 from 7.0 in those who took a placebo. Then the researchers re-randomized those who did not respond to placebo to receive either drugs or placebo, and found similar encouraging results for the drug combination.

“Fifty-five percent of the people who were on drugs had a 50 percent reduction in their agitation,” said the lead author, Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings, director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. “That’s a lot when a patient is striking and hitting and cussing. There are no currently approved treatments for agitation, and we’re very enthusiastic about this finding.”",Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer’s,3,Alzheimer's
story_reviews_00540,"In 1973, University of Massachusetts graduate student Tso-chen Chang opened a Chinese restaurant in the town of Amherst, to support himself. To supply the restaurant, he started an organic vegetable farm in Whately, in the fertile soil of the Connecticut River Valley. Because he grew a lot of vegetables, he started an organic produce trucking and distribution business. Then followed an immense commercial sprout business.

By 1985, the Chinese entrepreneur was casting about for new commercial crops to grow that would impart both food value and medicinal benefits. In conversations with his friend Dr. Shiu Hu of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, Chang became enamored of growing schisandra, a berry highly prized in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for its purported longevity promoting powers. Hu provided Chang with the fist seeds for this venture, which he planted at his Whately farm.

Today, Pioneer Valley Schisandra cultivates over fifty acres of U.S.D.A. Certified Organic Schisandra berries. The farm has been producing berries since the early 1990’s, and representatives from a number of giant multi-national corporations have driven out to the foothills of the Berkshires to kick tires and contemplate what they might do with a whole lot of schisandra berry.

At the farm during harvest, a number of Latinos work the berry bushes, which are set up on fenced wires, like the French espalier method of growing. The berries ripen inconsistently, so harvesters will make a few passes through the orchard during harvest season. Chang designed this way of cultivating schisandra, and actually went back to China to teach this method to growers there in China’s northern Liaoning Province. I visited that region in 2009 for the harvest, and saw that by that time, Chang’s method was commonly used everywhere.

At age 87, the clock is ticking for the fulfillment of Chang’s mission, but he seems to be in the right spot for this. Schisandra chinensis has been used in TCM for over 2,000 years. Schisandra is still relatively unknown in the U.S. market. But due to its age-old use for enhancing vitality and its strong science base, the berry and its preparations should get a good market boost in the years ahead.

The berry of schisandra owes its name Wu Wei Zi (five flavored berry) to the fact that it is sweet, sour, salty, bitter and pungent. Schisandra chinensis enjoys millennia of traditional use for prolong life, retarding the aging process, increasing energy, as a fatigue-fighter, and as a sexual tonic. Schisandra also possesses significant protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. It is considered one of the most highly protective of all medicinal plants, and the berry is included in many traditional herbal formulas for improving energy and mental health.

The activity of the berry appears due primarily to its concentration of two groups of novel compounds, known respectively as schizandrins and gomasins. These agents are lignans, and are extensively well studied for internal and topical benefits.

Schisandra counters stress by reducing the levels of stress hormones in the blood. Additionally, schisandra offers great benefits for athletes. In human studies the berry and its extracts have improved performance among long distance runners, skiers and gymnasts. For this reason schisandra berry is often found on the training tables of Chinese athletes.

Schisandra also offers special benefits for the mind. Several human studies show that schisandra extract improves concentration, coordination and endurance. Schisandra helps to prevent mental fatigue and increases accuracy and quality of work. In various human clinical studies with doctors, students, soldiers and other groups, schisandra demonstrated superior mind-sharpening powers.

As if all these benefits were insufficient, schisandra also offers first-rate liver-protective benefits. Schisandra helps in the treatment of hepatitis, as noted in over 500 cases. In fact, an antihepatitis drug was developed from Schizadrin C.

Standing outside in the early fall sun, admiring healthy schisandra bushes, it’s hard not not be impressed by the size and scope of Chang’s farm, and by his long-time commitment to this berry and its future. When Hippocrates advised to let your food be your medicine, he could easily have been referring to schisandra, whose time in the sun must surely come.

Much of the buzz over mobile health interventions seems to be about how we can use an ever-growing variety of shiny new smartphone apps and sensors to better manage our health.

But texting, that old-school technology, may deserve some of that spotlight, too.

Getting texts with motivating and informative messages led patients with coronary heart disease to make behavior changes like exercising more and smoking less, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. By the end of the six-month study, patients who had received the text messages had reduced their cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index.

""I have to say, we were pretty surprised that it worked,"" says Clara Chow, lead author of the study and program director of community-based cardiac services at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia.

And it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. ""These are the things that medications usually do, not text messages,"" says Chow, who is also an associate professor at Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney.

In a randomized clinical trial, more than 700 patients with coronary heart disease were split into two groups: half received four text messages per week for six months plus usual care, while the other half received just usual care.

The texts that patients received were semi-personalized, based on background information about each person, such as smoking status and preferred name. For example, vegetarian participants wouldn't receive the text message about how grilling steak is healthier than deep-frying it.

Other texts might include something like, ""Hi, Elizabeth. Have you gone for your walk today?"" or ""Have you taken your medications yet today? It's important to take them at the same time each day.""

There's a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. ""Everyone thinks it has a lot of potential, but there's actually very little evidence.""

While there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective, according to Zubin Eapen, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine.

""We [as physicians] are always looking for evidence to make sure that we are recommending the right things for our patients, whether it's a drug, a device or a digital product, like an app,"" says Eapen, who is also medical director of the Duke Heart Failure Same-Day Access Clinic.

Eapen coauthored an editorial, which was published alongside Chow's study, with Eric Peterson, the Fred Cobb Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the division of cardiology at Duke and an associate editor of JAMA.

Not only does this research provide evidence that a text-based program can improve heart disease risk factors, but it also shows that a bunch of bells and whistles aren't required for successful health outcomes. A simple, low-cost program of text messaging can do the trick.

""I like to look for things that are able to be used in multiple corners of our world, from low-income settings to high-income settings,"" Chow says. ""Everybody owns a mobile phone these days. You don't have to have a smartphone to text.""

That means more access across more sectors of a population. While almost two-thirds of American adults own a smartphone, that number rises even higher when you're talking about plain old cell phones – a full nine out of 10 American adults own some kind of cell phone.

Globally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. ""If we are going to reach a global population, we need solutions that are both scalable and affordable,"" Eapen says. ""And mobile health – and text messaging, maybe, in particular – represents both a scalable and affordable approach.""

Making healthy changes in behavior can be tough, but for patients with heart disease, it can be vital.

Yet those daily decisions – whether to smoke that cigarette, eat that piece of cake or skip the gym – are often ""far removed from the rewards or consequences,"" Eapen says. It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Encouraging text messages may help to inform those everyday decisions and keep a bigger goal in mind.

Chow and Eapen say the study has its limitations. It can't tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window. Yet patients in Chow's study resoundingly said that the text messaging helped them make the necessary changes – more than 90 percent of the participants found the program useful.

""People said things like, 'It wasn't actually what the messages said, it was that someone was there supporting me, thinking about me,' "" Chow says.

And although Chow and her colleagues told study participants that they did not need to reply to the text messages, many of them still did. ""Heaps of them replied to us,"" she says.

story_reviews_00543,"Adding small amounts of powdered ginger to food may help take the edge off seasonal allergy symptoms, according to an animal study published online in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. Daily intake of dried ginger significantly reduced sneezing and other signs of allergy in rodents with induced allergic rhinitis, or hay fever.

A major component in ginger, 6-gingerol, suppresses the activation of T lymphocytes, or T cells, a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in sensitizing people to specific allergens, the researchers said.

Ginger is a popular spice produced from the root of the ginger plant, Zingiber officinale. Some herbal remedies for nausea and other ailments also contain ginger.

Experiments in Japan involved mice fed a normal diet containing 2% powdered ginger or a control diet without ginger. After two weeks on the diets, the ginger-fed mice received two injections of purified egg proteins called ovalbumin (OVA) to stimulate allergic rhinitis symptoms. Control mice received either OVA or placebo injections.

The mice underwent an immune challenge two weeks later in which a small amount of OVA was inserted into the nose. Allergic symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal rubbing, were counted for the next 10 minutes.

Mice in the ginger-fed group sneezed 2.1 times each, on average. This compares with 15.2 sneezes per mouse in the OVA-injected controls and roughly one sneeze in the placebo-injected animals. Fewer nasal rubbing movements were recorded in the ginger-fed mice compared with OVA-injected controls, but not the placebo group.

Ginger-fed mice had lower levels of immunoglobulin E, or IgE, a type of allergic antibody, and mast cells, which release chemicals called histamines that cause sneezing and other allergic symptoms, the study showed. T cells stimulate the production of IgE to specific allergens. IgE binds to receptors on mast cells, triggering the release of histamine.

The study used powdered ginger, the type used in cooking, containing 0.5% 6-gingerol. Previous studies suggest powdered ginger contains higher concentrations of 6-gingerol than fresh ginger, researchers said.

Caveat: The antiallergic effects of ginger may vary with the 6-gingerol content, researchers said. Ginger has not been tested on people with allergic rhinitis.

story_reviews_00544,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s new Jardiance pill slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke, a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment and triple its use, according to researchers and analysts.

Lilly shares jumped as much as 9 percent after data from the trial was released Thursday at a medical meeting in Stockholm.

“This is the first diabetes therapy to show robust effect in reducing cardiovascular death. It really is big news,” said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people.

Because about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity.

Jardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys.

Jardiance was developed jointly with Germany’s privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.

Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events.

About 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.

“The big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff. That has not been the case with all things in diabetes,” said David Marrero, president of health care and education at the American Diabetes Association. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.”

JARDIANCE COULD BOOST EARNINGS

Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. He cut his 2020 sales forecast for Merck & Co Inc’s Januvia, the leading member of a competing class of oral diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors, to $6 billion from $7.8 billion.

Anderson estimates Jardiance could boost Lilly’s earnings per share by 8 percent on average across 2016 to 2020.

In the study, patients taking Jardiance had a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, including from heart attacks and strokes. There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes.

Those taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure.

The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said.

“This is a wonderful thing,” said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.

Zinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system.

Lilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial. But they did not unveil detailed data until Thursday at the medical meeting.

Shares of Lily closed up 6.5 percent at $89.98 on Thursday, after rising as high as $92.83.

In calculating the combined number of cardiac deaths, non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes, 14 percent fewer events were seen in patients taking Jardiance in combination with standard treatments, compared with patients who took standard treatments alone, meeting the study’s main goal.

Standard treatments included statins, which lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.",Lilly diabetes drug slashes deaths in patients with heart risk,3,Cardiovascular disease
story_reviews_00545,"Panel Says Aspirin Lowers Heart Attack Risk For Some

toggle caption Jim DeLillo/iStockphoto

Millions of Americans take baby aspirin every day to prevent a heart attack or stroke. If they are at high risk of heart disease, they're doing the right thing, according to draft recommendations issued Monday by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

The independent panel also said that taking low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years may protect against colorectal cancer, at least in people who are already taking it to prevent heart attacks and stroke.

Adults between the ages of 50 and 59 who have a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years benefit the most from taking about 81 milligrams of aspirin every day, the panel says.

But the potential benefit is smaller for adults between the ages of 60 and 69. And it's unknown for adults under 50 or over 70. People should talk with their health care provider to find out if they have health problems that would justify taking aspirin, according to Dr. Douglas Owens, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force.

For example, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, obesity, age and diabetes can all increase heart disease risk. ""Because heart attacks are caused by clots in the arteries of the heart, aspirin can help prevent heart attack and it can also help prevent strokes that are caused by blood clots,"" Owens says.

Several groups including the American Heart Association offer online calculators to help people figure out their risk, which, along with discussion with a health care provider, can help determine whether daily aspirin might be useful.

However, there is a caveat. Daily aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and brain. And Owens says that people with medical conditions like ulcers, kidney problems, liver problems or bleeding disorders are more vulnerable, as are people who take blood-thinning drugs and NSAIDs.

These new recommendations aren't final, and are open to public comment.

Concerns have been raised about whether aspirin is really effective enough, when so many other medicines are available to help control heart disease risk.

One physician with major concerns is Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio. ""I think that millions of Americans are taking aspirin — some of them are really the 'worried well,' "" he says.

If people don't have a significantly increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next decade, Nissen says, they may be ""causing more harm than benefit.""

And while many medical groups recommend daily aspirin to lower heart disease risk, not all federal agencies agree. The Food and Drug Administration actually issued a warning against routinely taking aspirin to prevent heart disease in people without significantly high risk.

Nissen worries that many people are mistaking their actual heart disease risk. ""With all the good therapies, better blood pressure control, better cholesterol control, all the things we do in modern medicine,"" he says, ""over the last couple of decades, we've had nearly a 50 percent reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease.""

People who don't really need to should not be taking aspirin every day, says Nissen. ""It's just not prudent or safe,"" he says, noting that bleeding in the abdomen or brain is extremely dangerous and can be fatal. Nissen does agree with the general consensus that taking low dose aspirin is beneficial for people who have had a heart attack or stroke.

But for pretty much everyone else, assessing actual heart disease risk in consultation with your doctor is crucial to deciding whether to take aspirin every day.",Panel Says Aspirin Lowers Heart Attack Risk For Some,4,Cardiovascular disease
story_reviews_00546,"Philippe Autier is willing to bet that taking vitamin D supplements will never be proved to do anything beyond helping to build strong bones — and certainly not to prevent heart disease, cancer, diabetes, depression, multiple sclerosis or the common cold, as many claim. In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects.

To Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D’s benefits is like a religion. “People want to have a simple story they can believe in,” he says.

Cedric Garland, meanwhile, hews just as strongly to the opposite view — that vitamin D supplements confer a slew of benefits, including warding off colon cancer, breast cancer, even Type 1 diabetes.

“The science is, in my opinion, unassailable,” says Garland, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego. “It’s just preposterous to say it’s not proven.”

In January 2014, Autier published a statistical analysis of results from hundreds of studies of vitamin D. He concluded: “Unfortunately, there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.”

Garland, on the other hand, is the co-author of dozens of studies showing a strong, inverse association between vitamin D levels and seemingly every disease under the sun. Indeed, sun exposure is Garland’s explanation for why rates of cancer, Type 1 diabetes and other diseases tend to be higher the farther people live from the equator. Vitamin D, after all, is the “sunshine vitamin,” synthesized from cholesterol in the skin in response to sunlight.

“It’s a mathematical relationship,” he said in a telephone interview. “The higher your latitude and the greater your area’s average cloud cover, the higher your rates of cancer.” Since he and his late brother, Frank Garland, published the first study, in 1980, revealing that relationship, hundreds of other studies have explored the link between vitamin D, including supplements, and health — but none were large enough, long enough or designed well enough to convince the skeptics.

Now three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public’s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves.

“There’s been a rush to judgment on vitamin D,” says JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Everyone has gotten on the bandwagon. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.”

Manson should know. She has led or collaborated on more than a dozen large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, dating back more than two decades, which found none of the expected protection against cancer, heart disease, dementia or other diseases that scientists once attributed to beta carotene, vitamin E or vitamin C supplements. (She did find, however, that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 offered modest protection against age-related macular degeneration and, for those with a diet low in B vitamins to begin with, a hint of protection against the loss of cognitive abilities.)

Now Manson is co-directing the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), testing whether, compared with placebo, a daily supplement of either 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or one gram of fish oil (another widely touted substance) reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, heart disease and other health problems. The five-year study, involving 25,874 men and women, is scheduled to end in October 2017.

Another trial is testing whether a daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D will prevent Type 2 diabetes. The so-called D2d study, which will run for four years, is seeking to enroll 2,382 people older than 30 who are at high risk of developing diabetes due to weight or blood-sugar levels but who have not yet been diagnosed with the disease.

“I would call myself an optimistic skeptic,” says Anastasios Pittas, principal investigator of the D2d study and a professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. “The indirect evidence is very strong. People with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood have been shown again and again to have a lower risk of developing diabetes in the future. These studies are as consistent as we have ever seen with any nutrient.”

But, he adds, “those studies do not prove cause and effect. Before we make a blanket recommendation for the 86 million people in the United States who are at risk for Type 2 diabetes to go out and buy vitamin D supplements, we need to know for sure if they help.”

A third trial, designed to test whether 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day will slow the progression of multiple sclerosis in 172 patients, is being led by Ellen Mowry, an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

“I do discuss vitamin D with my patients,” Mowry says. “But I point out that we don’t yet have randomized, controlled-trials data to back it up. That’s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations. We have to be sure.”

So what are people to do in the meantime? Four years ago, Manson sat on a committee established by the Institute of Medicine to review how much vitamin D and calcium Americans need each day to maintain health and prevent disease. The report concluded that both are necessary for bone health but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was “inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.” Even so, the committee recommended that children and adults up to age 70 get 600 IU of vitamin D daily — from food and, if necessary, supplements — and that adults age 71 and older get 800 IU.

Some studies have found no ill effects from taking far higher amounts, and many of the prospective but not proven benefits against cancer and other diseases are believed to require doses ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 IU. Manson urges people to rely on the Institute of Medicine report, which set a safe upper limit of 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.

“It’s fine to take that amount,” Manson said. “But keep in mind, there isn’t yet evidence that taking those higher amounts will confer any benefits beyond the recommended daily allotment of 600 to 800 IU.”

Some studies, she noted, have even found evidence that very high levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood might be just as unhealthful as very low levels. A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL. Such findings are why she, Mowry and Pittas strongly advise people against taking more than the currently recommended upper daily limit of 4,000 IU, even though doses as high as 10,000 IU are available online and at many stores.

Frustrated by the uncertainty? Pittas takes it in stride.

“This is the beauty of medical research,” he says, “where you have some people convinced that vitamin D does nothing and others who believe it’s already proved to work. There is such controversy now that the only way to convince people who sit on those sides of the equation is to complete rigorous, randomized trials. We’ll see what happens. I have a hypothesis that vitamin D will work, but we have to test it. At the end of the studies, one of us will be right. I just don’t know which one.”

In what the authors describe as the largest and longest study of resveratrol in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease, there’s encouraging news that the component, which is found in red wine, grapes and dark chocolate, may keep the disease from progressing.

Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology and director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center and his team created a purified form of resveratrol, which is being studied in both animal and human studies for preventing age-related conditions such as diabetes and cancer. In a study published in Neurology, he described how they randomly assigned half of a group of 119 men and women to take up to 1,000 mg of resveratrol daily, and the other half to a placebo, for a year. All of the participants had mild or moderate Alzheimer’s disease.

At the end of the year, Turner compared the people’s scores on cognitive tests and assessments of how independent they were in their daily living from the start of the study.

“My nightmare was that nothing would be different from the placebo group, and there would be nothing of interest to talk about,” he says. “But that did not happen. I think resveratrol is an engaging target that’s very interesting and could be pharmacologically manipulated to develop a treatment.”

The resveratrol group showed no change in the levels of a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Turner’s group also measured the protein in spinal fluid and blood, and did not see differences over the year in the resveratrol group. That’s likely because experts believe that as Alzheimer’s progresses, more of the protein plaques form in the brain, and less of the protein is released to the rest of the body.

The resveratrol group also showed smaller brain volume, which in the case of Alzheimer’s is a positive sign, as the disease can cause inflammation and swelling that can interfere with nerve connections.

Even more encouraging, the people who were treated showed slight improvements in their ability to maintain certain daily activities on their own, such dressing and bathing themselves.

How resveratrol may be affecting the Alzheimer’s disease process isn’t clear yet.

Turner says the findings don’t suggest that red wine is a cure for Alzheimer’s. The amounts of resveratrol in the purified doses that the participants took were extremely high and beyond those found on the market currently — around what would be contained in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.

Plus, he says, resveratrol supplements currently available over the counter are “unregulated and we don’t know how much is in it. We need more studies to see if it really does have benefit and then it could be turned into more effective drugs that can better target Alzheimer’s.”

story_reviews_00548,"A music legend fights Alzheimer's disease on his unforgettable farewell tour. CNN Films Presents:"" Glen Campbell ... I'll Be Me ,"" Saturday, November 7, at 8 p.m. ET.

(CNN) Over the years, resveratrol, an antioxidant found in grapes, chocolate and red wine, has been touted as a possible antidote to Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and many other conditions. Now, the first study in people with Alzheimer's suggests that the compound, when taken in concentrated doses, may actually have benefit in slowing progression of this disease.

Researchers at 21 medical centers across the United States looked at the safety and effectiveness of taking high doses of resveratrol in an experimental pill -- equal to the amount found in 1,000 bottles of red wine -- in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.

The researchers looked at several biomarkers of Alzheimer's, and found that people who took up to four pills a day for a year had higher levels of amyloid-beta proteins in their spinal fluid than those who took a placebo (control) pill.

Although accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, patients actually have lower levels of this protein outside of the brain. The study finding suggests that resveratrol could help change the balance from amyloid-beta buildup in the brain to circulating protein in the body.

Even if concentrated forms of resveratrol pills like the kind used in this study were available, it's too soon to recommend going out and getting some just yet.

""The study is encouraging enough that we should certainly go ahead and do a [larger] clinical trial because we showed that it is safe and does have significant effects on Alzheimer's biomarkers,"" said Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center and lead investigator of the study, which was published on Friday in the journal Neurology.

The main goal of the current study, which included 119 patients, was to find out whether high doses of resveratrol could be safe. The only small concern they found was that patients taking resveratrol lost about two pounds during the one-year study, and weight loss is already a problem with Alzheimer's, Turner said. In comparison, the control group gained about 1 pound.

Much more research is needed

The study was not big enough to answer some important questions, such as whether patients taking resveratrol actually had lower levels of amyloid-beta plaques in their brain, and most importantly, whether they experienced less decline in their mental faculties.

A large, phase 3 clinical trial getting at these issues could start in as soon as a year, Turner said. (The current study was a phase 2 trial, typically meant to evaluate safety and get an early look at efficacy of a new drug.)

Even for the relatively small number of participants in the study, the researchers did see indication that resveratrol could improve cognition. Patients in this group had slight improvements in their ability to carry out daily tasks, such as remembering to brush their teeth. And anecdotally, patients who took resveratrol told the researchers that they felt like they were maintaining their mental ability. (Neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was taking resveratrol and who was taking placebo.)

""To really get a better feel of how effective this could be you really need to do larger studies for longer periods of time (such as several years),"" said James A. Hendrix, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer's Association, a research and advocacy organization. ""Other potential therapies we've had had some early exciting results and then they didn't pan out in later trials,"" he added.

If resveratrol does pan out in further research, it may add to the medications that are currently available, such as Aricept and Exelon, which slow, but do not halt, progression of the disease, Hendrix said.

Ultimately, it will probably be a combination of several drugs, as well as diet, exercise and social and mental stimulation that help stave off the rapid mental decline that is often associated with Alzheimer's, he added.

Antioxidant may be most effective in combination

This is one of the first studies to look not only at these biomarkers, but also the metabolites of resveratrol in spinal fluid, to show that resveratrol is probably getting into the brain, said Dr. Giulio M. Pasinetti, who is the Saunders Family Chair and professor in neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. However, he added that changes in biomarkers may not necessarily lead to mental and behavioral improvements, which larger studies will address.

In addition, resveratrol on its own might not end up working as well as a combination of resveratrol and other polyphenol compounds found in red wine, grape juice and grape seed extract, which could help people at risk of Alzheimer's and those who already have mild symptoms, Pasinetti said.

The current study used high doses of resveratrol to increase the chances that enough of the compound got into the brain to have an effect. But for now, the best way to get resveratrol is probably through diet. One glass of red wine a day could help those with mild Alzheimer's, ""but no more than that,"" Turner said.

There is probably little benefit in taking currently available resveratrol supplements, even if they claim to contain levels similar to the ones used in this study. ""The things that are on the market are not regulated, and you don't know how much is in them,"" Turner said. ""There could be 500 milligrams, which is what they advertise [researchers gave participants in the study four 500 milligram pills a day] or there could be zero,"" he said.

Previous research has suggested that people who consume diets rich in resveratrol do not have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and other conditions.","For Alzheimer's patients, resveratrol brings new hope",5,Alzheimer's

story_reviews_00550,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pathway Genomics, a company known for pushing the boundaries of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, on Thursday will launch a cancer screening test designed to detect bits of cancer DNA in the blood of otherwise healthy people.

The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of “liquid biopsies,” which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers.

Several cancer diagnostic companies have been working on the tests, a field that has recently been joined by makers of DNA blood screening tests for fetal abnormalities after the tests detected early cancers in expectant mothers. Cowen & Co estimates that use of DNA blood tests for cancer screening will exceed $10 billion a year by the end of the decade.

But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health.

The company has already run into trouble on a similar issue. In 2010, Walgreens pulled Pathway’s genetic testing kits from its pharmacies after U.S. health regulators warned patients might take action without understanding the results.

Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway’s, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. Doctors will also need a clear assessment of their accuracy.

“For any given test, the rate of false positives causing unnecessary alarm and false negatives that provide false security should be known,” said Dr. Keith Stewart, an oncologist who heads Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine.

Pathway’s screening test looks at 96 genetic markers associated with major cancer types such as breast, ovarian, lung, colon and melanoma. The company is focusing on mutations that are relatively well-understood, and for which there are specific treatments, said Chief Executive Jim Plante.

The cost to consumers begins at $299 to periodically check for DNA in their blood that could act as an early warning sign of cancer. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient’s risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing.

Pathway also launched a blood test for patients already diagnosed with cancer to help determine whether a treatment is working, or whether the disease is likely to return.

SCREENING VS MONITORING

Scientists have long known that cancers shed bits of genetic material into the blood. Privately held Guardant Health and Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc already offer blood tests for cancer patients. Roche-backed Foundation Medicine Inc, Genomic Health Inc, Illumina Inc and Sequenom Inc say they have similar tests in the works.

But cancer experts say there are major differences between using such tests to screen for cancer and monitoring patients who are already known to have it.

For example, some early cancers may not secrete DNA fragments into the bloodstream and require other types of detection. A colonoscopy can find and remove polyps before they pose a threat as colon cancer.

“If we are relying on a test that can only detect cancer after it has formed, we miss a huge opportunity to intervene,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Patients might be attracted to a less-invasive test for colon cancer, but if it is less effective, it might result in more cases of colon cancer, not fewer.

Another concern is that the tests may pick up on markers that are never destined to be cancer, something already known to occur in blood tests for prostate cancer, Kopetz said.

Pathway says its test is more than 99 percent accurate in detecting mutations in blood samples that contain at least nine copies of a tested mutation.

“We do expect to detect cancer DNA when the tumors are small - much sooner than stage three or four,” Plante said.

Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said Pathway’s figure represents the test’s technical ability to detect DNA in the blood.

Doctors, however, need an indication of how many patients will get a false positive result, something that can only be determined in a very large clinical trial, said Vogelstein. He is advising two companies developing liquid biopsy tests for cancer screening: Sysmex and Personal Genome Diagnostics.

Plante said the company has started two clinical trials involving patients but has yet to publish any results on how the tests perform in people.",Pathway launches 'liquid biopsy' to find cancer in healthy people,5,Cancer

In the 1950s through the early ’70s, research began to show that psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, could be quite effective at treating mental health disorders like addiction.

“In the ’50s and ’60s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,” says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA.

But at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. Then President Richard Nixon declared drugs “public enemy No. 1” and the so-called “war on drugs” began. All this combined to give psychedelics a bad name at the time and led to most of them being outlawed. For nearly a generation, science on these substances shut down.

Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week

But that’s changing. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia.

In 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona published a study showing obsessive-compulsive patients who ingested psilocybin had immediate and lasting reductions in problematic symptoms. The same year, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Roland Griffiths showed that in healthy volunteers, psilocybin produced lasting benefits like improved mood and peacefulness six months after ingestion. Study participants “made claims to be more sensitive, compassionate, tolerant, to have increased positive relationships, an increased need to serve others,” according to Griffiths. “Those kinds of changes are not delusional, because blinded interviews with family members, friends and work colleagues [confirm these reports].”

Similar work has shown psilocybin can help treat anxiety associated with cancer, at UCLA and New York University. Grob says work by his group and others has shown that psilocybin can help treat “terminal cancer patients with overwhelming existential anxiety, an area that traditional medicine struggles with.” And a study in late 2014 found that LSD permanently reduced anxiety in a small number of patients.

Wood says he’s most excited about research into using psychedelics to treat addiction, and he published a review on September 8 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal covering recent work in this field. One study from earlier this year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found, for example, that 10 alcoholic patients given psilocybin in a controlled setting had greatly reduced cravings for and intake of alcohol in the months after the treatment. Another study, authored in 2014 by Griffiths and Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins and published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found the substance helped people give up cigarettes. Twelve out of 15 patients in this small study had given up smoking six months after a psilocybin-assisted therapy session.

Ayahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing dimethyltryptamine that causes hallucinations and often intense spiritual experiences, has also shown promise in treating addictions, besides anxiety and depression, Wood says. Another chemical, called MDMA, the active ingredient in the drug Ecstasy, can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.

Psychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or “mystical” experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. The idea that you can take a medicine one or a few times and become “cured,” or at least significantly helped, conflicts with current standard practices, which often involve taking medications every day for years, or life.

“With even minor mental health conditions like minor depression or anxiety...or more serious problems like addiction, the existing paradigm is to frame these as chronic, lifelong diseases” that require continuous medication with drugs like serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, Wood says. But not so with psychedelics, which represent “a total paradigm shift in the way that mental illness is treated,” he adds.

He points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the “set and setting” (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted. All of which adds up to a compelling argument that psychedelics “should be the focus of intensive study for treating mental illness,” Wood says.",Psychedelics Promise a ‘Paradigm Shift’ in Treating Mental Illness,3,Depression
story_reviews_00552,"""I was a skeleton when I walked out. ... But I walked out being told they couldn't find any cancer cells in my body. When you've already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it's unnerving."" - Bill Ludwig, 70, Penn’s first T-cell patient. DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer

Four years ago, University of Pennsylvania researchers published early but electrifying results. An experimental T-cell therapy eradicated end-stage leukemia in two patients, and put a third in remission. Soon after that, pharmaceutical giant Novartis partnered with Penn, aiming to commercialize the breakthrough. Since then, a more modest picture of success has emerged in treating the blood cancer, a type called chronic lymphocytic leukemia that usually strikes in middle age or later. Of the first 14 CLL patients given the T-cell therapy, four had their cancers disappear - including the first two, who are now about five years cancer-free. Four others got better but then their cancer progressed. And six had no response to the T-cell therapy.

In addition to those results, published last week in Science Translational Medicine, the Penn team has orally presented data for a total of 38 CLL patients.

Cancer disappeared in nine (24 percent), and temporarily regressed in another nine.

CLL typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia, and may be held in check for years with chemotherapy.

In comparison, Penn's T-cell therapy has been spectacularly effective in more than 50 children and adults with a fast-progressing type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Long-lasting, complete remissions have occurred in more than 60 percent of patients.

Other major centers that are developing T-cell therapies, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and the National Cancer Institute, also have found that the approach works far better in ALL than CLL.

The method is complex and costly, and often triggers life-threatening complications. It involves genetically engineering each patient's disease-fighting T cells to recognize and attack their cancer cells.

When it works, the therapy also offers the hope of a rarity in terminal-stage cancer: a onetime curative treatment. Stem-cell transplantation, a risky, last-resort treatment that can sometimes be curative, is not a suitable option for most patients with CLL.

""The field of CLL is exploding now,"" said Penn leukemia specialist David L. Porter, the director of blood and bone marrow transplantation. ""At the very limit of this [T-cell] treatment, one could consider it like a stem-cell transplant. It's a highly technical approach, but it clearly has a role for a select group of patients. There is something very attractive about a once-and-done therapy.""

Walter J. Urba, director of research at Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Ore., wrote an editorial four years ago cautioning that only wider testing would show whether Penn's ""impressive"" initial results were ""an authentic advance"" for CLL.

Last week, Urba said Penn's T-cell therapy ""remains very exciting,"" despite the costs and toxic side effects.

""Everything we do in oncology is a risk-benefit balance,"" Urba said. ""I suspect that over time we'll have better T-cell therapies, maybe given with other immune therapies.""

Indeed, Penn and other centers have begun testing next-generation T cells in more blood malignancies including lymphomas, and against the ultimate biological challenge - solid tumor cancers.

For Penn's very first T-cell patient, Bill Ludwig, 70, the pace of progress is thrilling, humbling, and yet, a bit of a letdown.

The retired corrections officer from Bridgeton, N.J., was losing his decadelong battle with CLL when he agreed to try the novel therapy in August 2010.

""I didn't hesitate because I had no options left,"" he recalled last week. ""And also, these people at Penn had been so wonderful to me and my family for 10 years. I felt obligated to say yes. Did I ever think it would be successful? Not in a million years.""

He suffered catastrophic side effects as his immune system went into overdrive and his body struggled to eliminate seven pounds worth of dead cancer cells.

""I was in intensive care, with all my major organs shutting down,"" he said. ""My lower extremities were twice the size they should have been. They called my wife and said, 'He's not going to see the sunrise.' ""

They were wrong.

""I was a skeleton when I walked out"" a month later, he said. ""But I walked out being told they couldn't find any cancer cells in my body. When you've already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it's unnerving.""

Ludwig and his wife have since bought a recreational vehicle and traveled the country, seen grandchildren graduate high school, and welcomed three great-grandchildren.

Still, he can't help feeling disappointed that the phenomenal early success of the therapy was just that.

""When two out of three are successful, you think maybe it will be 9 out of 10, or 19 out of 20. I figured if they can cure me, they can cure everyone.""

He corrected himself: ""They've never said 'cured.' But 'cancer-free' works for me.""

story_reviews_00553,"(Reuters Health) - Many women with severe menopausal symptoms are not being treated for them even though safe, effective remedies are available, a study from Australia suggests.

A woman photographs roses at Regent's Park in London July 5, 2013. REUTERS/Neil Hall

The findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R. Davis from Monash University in Melbourne.

“From my interactions with colleagues from across the globe, I do not believe that what we have observed is Australian-specific,” she told Reuters Health by email. “The management of menopause has been relatively similar in the UK, the USA and in Australia.”

Up to half of women in menopause experience so-called vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which generally combines estrogen plus progestin, is very effective. But after the initial findings of the Women’s Health Initiative study showed that HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and other serious problems, many women stopped using it.

As reported in the journal Menopause, in 2013 and 2014 Davis and her team analyzed survey responses from nearly 1,500 women ages 40 to 65.

Seventeen percent were having moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, and 18 percent reported moderate to severe sexual symptoms.

But most were not receiving any kind of treatment. Only 11 percent reported use of HRT, and less than 1 percent were using any type of therapy that didn’t involve hormones.

The women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen, rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer, the researchers found.

“Extrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,” they write.

In addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say.

Why are so few women being treated?

“Overall, there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are, what is and is not safe, and of the safe options - what and how to prescribe them,” Davis said.

There is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting.

“It isn’t ‘grin and bear it for a few months’ and it will all pass, as many women suffer severe symptoms for five-plus years,” she said. “Women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.”

Finally, many women don’t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.

Dr. Wulf H. Utian, medical director of the North American Menopause Society, agrees that many reasons may underlie the lack of treatment. “It is partly ‘fall out’ from the controversy over hormone therapy,” he told Reuters Health in an email.

But overall, he said, it is a combination of patients not wanting therapy or not having information about it, and also the provider not prescribing it.

The company’s shares were up 25 percent at $5.26 in mid-day trading on heavy volumes.

Shares of BioTime Inc, a company that owns nearly 70 percent of Asterias, were little changed at $3.07.

The therapy, AST OPC-1, is the first product derived from human embryos to be tested on humans.

Its success is a key step toward proving that embryonic stem cell research could cure diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s and serious health conditions such immune deficiencies, stroke and spinal injuries.

Data showed that the severity of the spinal injury was reduced in the first patient and two other patients were able to resume their rehabilitation programs soon after being injected with the stem cells.

The early study tested the benefits of a smaller dose of 2 million stem cells that are tuned to develop into nerves.

Asterias bought OPC-1 in 2013 from the erstwhile stem cell research leader Geron Corp, which decided to focus on developing cancer drugs.

Geron chose to abandon its stem cell therapy in 2011 after such research got embroiled in the abortion debate, prompting many biotech companies to stay quiet about their research.

Monday’s announcement was the first about the therapy in more than two years.

In an early-stage study conducted by Geron, the therapy showed potential in repairing spinal injury in four of the five patients tested, without any adverse events.

Asterias is looking to show recovery of mobility in four out of every 10 patients treated with OPC-1, compared with two out of 10 achieving the same level of improvement without any treatment, Chief Executive Pedro Lichtinger told Reuters in early August.

Menlo Park, California-based Asterias expects to release complete safety data from the first half of the study later in the year.

Lichtinger said he was confident the data would be positive but was not expecting miracles.

TUESDAY, Aug. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Needles beat pills for treating hot flashes in breast cancer survivors, according to a new trial that compared acupuncture, ""sham"" acupuncture, the medication gabapentin and a placebo pill.

Interestingly, sham acupuncture came in second place for effectiveness, the researchers said.

Furthermore, the effects of acupuncture were ""significant and enduring for hot flashes while gabapentin's effect only happened when a patient was taking the medication,"" said study first author Dr. Jun Mao, an associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

The study was published Aug. 24 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Mao and his colleagues tested the treatments in 120 women who were breast cancer survivors. The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.

Thirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.

The women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.

Acupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.

""The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,"" Mao said. ""The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.""

The results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that ""there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,"" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ""There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.""

Deng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. ""In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,"" he said. ""The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.""

No one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. ""It's like psychotherapy,"" he added. ""Why does it work for some people and not others?"" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said ""there is a fertile field for further research.""

Some patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.

However, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. ""Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,"" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.

One big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.

But should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?

""For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,"" Deng said.

story_reviews_00557,"(Reuters Health) - Taking one or two baby aspirins a day for at least five years was tied to a lower risk of colorectal cancer in a study from Denmark.

Earlier studies had suggested that aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help protect against colorectal cancer, but it wasn’t clear how much had to be taken, and for how long, to achieve those benefits.

Now, using data on more than 113,000 individuals, researchers have been trying to sort out the relationship between aspirin and NSAIDs, duration of treatment, and colorectal cancer rates.

In general, the risk of developing colorectal cancer varies with age, race, ethnicity and lifestyle. More than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed in people older than 50, according to the National Cancer Institute.

An online risk calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available here: 1.usa.gov/1DlscTL) indicates that in the U.S., for an average white or black woman in her late fifties, the 10-year risk of developing colorectal cancer is between 1 and 1.4 percent, and her lifetime risk is between 5 and 5.4 percent. For an average black or white male of the same age, the corresponding risks would be about 1.4 percent and 5.8 percent.

In the new study from Denmark, taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 27%, and using nonaspirin NSAIDs for at least five years appeared to reduce it by 30%.

On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.

“Unless low-dose aspirin is taken continuously, there is little protection against colorectal cancer,” Dr. Soren Friis from the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen told Reuters Health.

Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said.

Aspirin and NSAIDs carry their own risks, however. Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.

The study had several limitations. For instance, the researchers only had data for users who obtained their aspirin or NSAIDs from doctors’ prescriptions. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Also, the researchers can’t rule out the possibility that other factors may have increased participants’ risk for colorectal cancer, such as obesity, dietary habits, alcohol use, and family history of colorectal cancer.

Dr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.

“Self-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,” Dr. Friis said. “The public should not take any medication regularly without consulting with a physician.”

Dr. Gurpreet Singh Ranger from Upper River Valley Hospital, Waterville, New Brunswick and Dalhousie Medical School, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, agreed with Dr. Friis.

“Low dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,” he told Reuters Health by email. But “before starting to take aspirin long term, it is important to discuss the implications with your family doctor or specialist.”

story_reviews_00558,"A common heart drug called a beta blocker was associated with a striking increase in survival for women with ovarian cancer in a study that suggests a possible new strategy for treating a variety of tumors.

Researchers analyzing a database of 1,425 women with the tough-to-treat cancer found those who had taken a certain type of beta blocker lived more than four years longer on average than those who hadn’t been prescribed the drug. The women were taking the medicine to treat high blood pressure or another heart problem, not as part of their cancer treatment.

The study was retrospective, and thus wasn’t randomized, and had other important limitations, researchers said. Further research, which is under way, is necessary to determine whether the findings could be translated into a new treatment for the disease.

“It’s very interesting and very thought-provoking,” said Christina M. Annunziata, clinical director of the women’s malignancies branch of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Institutes of Health. “I don’t think it’s practice-changing quite yet.” Dr. Annunziata, who wasn’t involved in the study, co-authored an editorial accompanying the report, published in Cancer, a journal of the American Cancer Society.

More than 21,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, the cancer society estimates. More than 14,000 will die from it, making it the fifth most deadly cancer among women. Recurrence rates are high and there have been few advances made beyond standard chemotherapy in some 30 years.

Dr. Annunziata and the study authors cautioned that beta blockers have side effects and more research is needed to see if the drugs’ benefits outweigh risks for cancer patients.

In recent years, studies have shown that chronic stress promotes the growth and spread of ovarian and other cancers. One way is by stimulating so-called fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline and norepinephrine, said Anil Sood, professor of gynecologic oncology and cancer biology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and senior author of the new report. Beta blockers can mitigate stress but previous studies that looked at their effect on ovarian cancer have been mixed.

Beta blockers come in different versions. Mouse and test-tube studies have shown that so-called nonselective beta blockers inhibit molecular pathways that promote tumor growth. Selective versions, designed to minimize side effects for heart patients, are less effective in hitting such targets. Dr. Sood and his colleagues wondered if the same effect would be found in people.

The 1,425 patients in the study were treated at four different institutions between 2000 and 2010; 268 had been treated with beta blockers, including 75 given a nonselective version, while they were on chemotherapy. The researchers found that median survival for those treated with any blocker was 47.8 months, compared with 42 months for those not taking the medicines.

But difference between those taking a nonselective beta blocker—propranolol in essentially all cases—and those taking a selective version was much more dramatic: 94.9 months versus 38 months.

“We would have predicted that there would be some difference but we were surprised to see the magnitude of difference that was coming up here,” Dr. Sood said.

Still, it would “require prospective studies to feel really good that there is a significant benefit,” Dr. Sood said. The study didn’t show what dose might be effective or how long patients were on the drugs, for instance, or what biological markers might help predict which patients would benefit.

“This is not something that people should rush out and start taking,” Dr. Annunziata said. “There are so many side effects of these drugs especially if you don’t have high blood pressure.” For instance, people with a history of asthma would be at risk for serious side effects with a nonselective beta blocker.

Since essentially all beta blockers, including propranolol, are generic, drug companies aren’t likely to sponsor the large prospective study that would likely be necessary to determine any role beta blockers might have in cancer. Grants would be required, Dr. Sood said. But other research has suggested that stress may similarly affect colon, lung and prostate cancers.

story_reviews_00559,"Welcome to Dear Julia, a weekly column where readers can submit everyday health questions on anything from the science of hangovers to the mysteries of back pain. Julia Belluz will sift through the research and consult with experts in the field to figure out how science can help us live happier and healthier lives.

Have a question? Use our submission form or ask @juliaoftoronto on Twitter.

What's the difference between Tylenol, Advil, and aspirin? Which is the best to take for pain?

I used to take acetaminophen (usually referred to by its brand name, Tylenol) for the occasional headache or sore muscle, mostly because that's what we used in my house growing up. I didn't think much about whether it was more or less effective than any other type of over-the-counter pain reliever, and I suspect the same is true for many folks. Acetaminophen, after all, is the most popular over-the-counter painkiller worldwide.

So I was surprised when I found out there's a huge gap between how pain researchers think about this drug and how the public does. More specifically, every researcher I contacted for this piece said some variation of what Andrew Moore, a pain researcher at Oxford University, told me: Tylenol doesn't actually work that well for pain. To be more exact, he said, ""I can't imagine why anybody would take acetaminophen.""

Moore has done a number of systematic reviews on over-the-counter pain medications, looking at all the available evidence to figure out which ones work best for various problems. I asked him to describe the overall success rates for the most common three: acetaminophen (like Tylenol), ibuprofen (like Advil), and aspirin.

Like all good evidence-based medicine thinkers, he was able to provide a very practical answer: ""If you’re talking about aspirin in doses of 500 to 1,000 mg or two tablets, 30 percent of people get relief from acute pain. For acetaminophen at doses of 500 to 1,000 mg, about 40 percent have a success. For ibuprofen, in its normal formulation at something around 400 mg or two tablets, about 50 percent have success.""

Now, Moore was referring here to acute pain that strikes after a specific event, like a surgery, a cut, or a burn, but his message was simple: Ibuprofen seems to work best, followed by acetaminophen, and then aspirin.

For ongoing (or chronic) pain — a sore lower back, say, or the kind of degenerative arthritis that typically develops with age — ibuprofen still outperforms acetaminophen.

""WE FOUND THAT [TYLENOL] IS INEFFECTIVE ON BOTH PAIN AND DISABILITY OUTCOMES FOR LOW BACK PAIN"" A 2015 systematic review of high-quality evidence, published in the BMJ, found that acetaminophen didn't seem to help most sufferers of chronic low back pain, and that it barely alleviates pain in people with osteoarthritis. As the researchers wrote, ""We found that [acetaminophen] is ineffective on both pain and disability outcomes for low back pain in the immediate and short term and is not clinically superior to placebo on both pain and disability outcomes for osteoarthritis.""

A limitation of the study is that the evidence on acetaminophen was mainly for acute low back pain, but as the University of Leeds's Philip Conaghan explained, ""There is very little long-term data [on chronic back pain], and if a drug doesn't work in the acute problem, it seems unlikely to work in the chronic phase — though back pain may be even more complex than osteoarthritis pain.""

The study also noted that patients on acetaminophen ""are nearly four times more likely to have abnormal results on liver function tests compared with those taking oral placebo.""

Other studies, like this well-designed randomized control trial of people with knee pain, have similar conclusions: Acetaminophen doesn't perform as well as ibuprofen, and it's linked to higher rates of liver problems. (Ibuprofen also has potential side effects; more on that below.)

So what about the occasional headache? What works best for that?

It turns out this is another fascinating problem area for pain researchers. Moore has looked at all the evidence for what he calls ""infrequent tension headaches"" and found ""it is surprising how poor [the research] is and how little it tells us."" Either the outcomes in studies are badly defined, the studies have too few participants to say anything concrete, or many people in the studies actually seem to have chronic headaches as opposed to the ordinary ones the researchers are allegedly studying.

""Most people would say, if you look at the data, take an ibuprofen tablet,"" Moore said. ""Acetaminophen is just not a very good analgesic [pain reliever], yet it’s the go-to drug because it’s thought to be safe.""

And that's where things get even more interesting: Acetaminophen isn't actually that safe.

""We always thought [acetaminophen] was safe, but there are increasing signals of accidental overdose in people who are regularly using it for chronic pain, and some liver toxicity,"" explained Conaghan, who has studied adverse events data related to this popular drug.

Between 1998 and 2003, acetaminophen was the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US. There are also hundreds of related deaths every year — though keep in mind that millions of people take drugs with acetaminophen, so these more extreme side effects are rare (especially if you're only taking them in small doses occasionally). Still, for the drug's minimal pain-killing benefits, the risks may not be worth it.



""Don't believe that just because something is over-the-counter, it’s safe,"" Conaghan added. (He advised people to see their doctor if they're taking any of these painkillers for more than a few days — particularly if they're on other drugs already.)

""[Tylenol] is an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether""

Kay Brune, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Germany's Friedrich-Alexander University who has also studied the toxicity of painkillers, was even more direct in his thoughts on acetaminophen: ""It's an old drug, obsolete, and should be avoided altogether.""

Aspirin is safer than acetaminophen, he said, though to be used as a pain reliever it requires much higher doses — which can have side effects like stomach upset. Aspirin also interferes with blood coagulation for days after taking it. ""If you take one gram of aspirin,"" Brune explained, ""you're at risk of bleeding for another four days."" This is why aspirin has its place as a protective agent against strokes and heart attacks for people at a higher risk.

Ibuprofen doesn't have these two problems — it's less toxic than the others in the doses that give people pain relief. But it has other side effects. ""Ibuprofen puts people at risk of bleeds in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney damage — so it's not free of risk,"" said Brune. Using it in high doses also seems to raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke — one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently warned people should only use ibuprofen (and other ""nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,"" or NSAIDS, like naproxen) for short periods of time and in small amounts.



I asked Brune about what he'd suggest for the occasional headache or sore muscle. ""Taking 400 mg of ibuprofen won't cause measurable harm,"" he answered. ""Of all drugs we have available, for most indications, it's also the most effective one.""

Is acetaminophen good for anything?

If the research community seems to have sided with ibuprofen for pain, is acetaminophen good for anything?



Yes. There are some groups of people with health complications who shouldn't take ibuprofen. For example, patients with kidney, gastric, cardiovascular, or bleeding problems may need to avoid NSAIDS like ibuprofen, so doctors might suggest Tylenol in these cases.



There's also some evidence that NSAIDS may increase the risk of psychosis and cognitive impairment in the elderly, so doctors may avoid prescribing these drugs for older patients. And Tylenol is generally considered safer than Advil or aspirin for pregnant women.



Fever is another area where acetaminophen can help, said Moore. According to one systematic review, acetaminophen seems to be safe for treating very young kids with fever, and you can give children as young as 3 months old acetaminophen, whereas you need to wait until kids are at least 6 months old to safely treat them with ibuprofen. This may help to explain the popularity of drugs like Tylenol for kids.

But a final caveat here: If your child is older than 6 months, it's not all that clear that acetaminophen outperforms ibuprofen for reducing fevers, and the same is true for adults. So keep that in mind the next time you confront your medicine cabinet.

story_reviews_00560,"The Ache: The bathroom scale shows how much you’ve gained or lost in pounds, but gives no information about whether the change is fat or muscle.

The Claim: A whole-body scan, called Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, or DXA for short, gives a detailed snapshot of your body composition, including how your body weight breaks down into fat, bone and lean tissue.

The Verdict: The whole-body scan is highly accurate compared with most other methods for determining body composition, scientists say, and it is useful for tracking progress over time.

Body-mass index, calculated using height and weight, is widely used as a measure of being overweight, but it “doesn’t tell the whole story,” says Steven R. Goldstein, co-director of the Bone Densitometry and Body Composition unit at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. In an abstract of a 50-person study presented in October at the annual meeting of the North American Menopause Society, researchers found that 18.5% of the women with normal BMI actually had significant excess fat as measured on DXA, making them “skinny fat” people, says Dr. Goldstein, who co-wrote the paper. Also, some women flagged by BMI as overweight actually had normal levels of fat, he says.

For people trying to lose fat and gain muscle through diet, exercise and resistance training, the X-ray scan “takes the guesswork” out figuring how well you’re doing, says Param Dedhia, a physician at Canyon Ranch, a spa in Tucson, Ariz., that offers the scans. Clients typically get the scans between three months and two years apart to measure progress, he says.

A DXA scan (pronounced dexa) is commonly used to measure bone density, but recently has been increasingly used to measure body composition. The scan takes three to 12 minutes, depending on the type of machine and your body size.

The cost, $45 to $350 or more, generally isn’t covered by insurance. It is available at a growing number of spas, hospitals and doctor’s offices, says Tom Webb, global product marketing manager, body-composition, for General Electric Co. ’s GE Healthcare unit, which makes two popular scanners.

After the scan, you get a report with the mass of your bones, fat and lean tissue (including organs and muscle) broken out individually. Your body-fat percentage is also listed and can be compared with reference values for Americans. The report also shows the amount of fat and lean tissue in each body part, such as the right arm or left leg—information that can be helpful for athletes to see if an injured limb is regaining muscle, says John A. Shepherd, director of the Body Composition, Exercise Physiology and Energy Metabolism laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco.

Both of GE’s machines, the Lunar iDXA and Lunar Prodigy, and Hologic’s Horizon DXA estimate how much visceral fat you have, a measure that can help predict risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, says Dr. Shepherd, whose lab has received research funding from both companies. (Dr. Shepherd also worked as principal scientist at Hologic from 1996 to 1999 but has no direct financial relationship currently, he says.)

Among methods now available for measuring body composition, DXA “would rank among the top,” says Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. It is more accurate than water weighing, long used by researchers to estimate body-fat mass, and more reliable than bioimpedance, a method found on some home scales, and pinching a fold of skin with calipers, she adds.

DXA is reliable when measuring progress over time, Dr. Shepherd says. It is important to use the same model of machine when comparing scans, as results vary slightly among them.

A 2013 study published in the Journal of Clinical Densitometry by researchers at USCF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only small differences when the same 600 people were scanned and rescanned between three and 51 days later. For fat mass, for example, the machine was precise within about a pound in either direction.

Scanning too often will show incremental changes and the results won’t be meaningful, says British researcher Susan Hopkins a lecturer in medical imaging at the University of Exeter Medical School.

How often to scan depends on how fast you are making progress. An obese person on a crash diet might see a large change worth measuring fairly soon, for example, while an elderly person slowly building muscle mass through resistance training might progress slowly, and therefore need less frequent scans, Dr. Hopkins says.

DXA scans involve a small amount of radiation, generally between less than 1 and 10 microsieverts, Dr. Shepherd says. That is only a fraction of a chest X-ray, which ranges from 50 to 150 microsieverts, or a mammogram, at about 400, and is about the same as one day of background radiation, he says.

With complicated grief, “something gets in the way of that adaptation,” she said. “Something impedes the course of healing.”

How common is this prolonged grief? An epidemiological study of more than 2,500 people, conducted in Germany in 2009, put the proportion at nearly 7 percent, and at 9 percent among those over age 61.

George A. Bonanno, director of the Loss, Trauma and Emotion Lab at Columbia University Teachers College, said the real figure might be closer to 10 to 15 percent.

Dr. Bonanno, author of “The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After Loss,” argues that resilience is the typical response to the death of loved ones. Yet, he notes, “we always see a group of people who don’t recover.”

The problem appears more likely when a death is sudden or violent; when the person who died was one’s spouse, romantic partner or child; and when the bereaved person has a history of depression, anxiety or substance abuse.

Defining this sort of grief has engendered some professional disagreement. What criteria distinguish complicated grief from depression or anxiety? When does normal grief become prolonged? Researchers disagree on even the condition’s name.

The American Psychiatric Association, in the latest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, declined to classify complicated grief as a mental disorder and instead included “persistent complex bereavement-related disorder” in an appendix for further study.",A Grief So Deep It Won’t Die,3,Depression

I'm driving through a frozen world, where the roads are paved in ice. As I swerve left to avoid a miniature iceberg, a red fish flashes at the top of my screen. I'm supposed to tap all the red fish that pop up, but not the green fish or the blue. And I have to do this without crashing the car.

An unidentifiable, omnipresent game-meister says: ""Doing one thing at a time is easy, but doing them both at the same time is where the magic happens!""

As I get better at the game, my brain is being trained to ignore distractions and stay focused — or, at least, that's the hypothesis of the neuroscientists who designed it.

The brain networks that control multitasking overlap with networks that control working memory and attention span. So some scientists believe that by playing this game — Project Evo — you can improve a range of cognitive skills and, by extension, relieve a range of symptoms associated with cognitive disorders.

""We've been through eight or nine completed clinical trials, in all cognitive disorders: ADHD, autism, depression,"" says Matt Omernick, executive creative director at Akili, the Northern California startup that's developing the game.

Omernick worked at Lucas Arts for years, making Star Wars games, where players attack their enemies with light sabers. Now, he's working on Project Evo. It's a total switch in mission, from dreaming up best-sellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions.

""The qualities of a good video game, things that hook you, what makes the brain — snap — engage and go, could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine,"" he says.

In fact, the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for ADHD. But this kind of goal requires a totally different business model; before they can deliver their game to players, they first have to go through the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA.

""The first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting, everyone's like, 'Oooo, that's scary, do we want to do that?' "" Omernick recalls.

Silicon Valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible; the process for FDA approval can be slow and expensive.

""If it says 'FDA approval needed' in the business plan, I myself scream in fear and run away,"" says Tim Chang, managing director at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. He has never backed a company that wanted to go through the FDA.

Most startups can bring a new video game to market in six months. Going through the FDA approval process for medical devices could take three or four years — and cost millions of dollars.

""That's what's been scary about going the regulatory path,"" Chang says. ""You're waiting and waiting and waiting for FDA approval, going through all these different clinical tests, and you could run out of money easily before you get through that.""

The worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the FDA process is complete. Tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits. Chang says in four years a game could be obsolete.

""It's really out of sync with the way we think of product iteration,"" he says. ""We're more on the order of days and real-time changes, where you're pushing out app updates every week.""

On the other hand, Chang admits that going the regulatory route could really pay off. If the FDA gives its stamp of approval, doctors could prescribe the game. And that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it.

""Then you're going into the land of the big, big budgets,"" Chang says.

Within in the health care field, some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush could translate into the medical world. They see the potential of these games to not only make money — but to save money, too.

""When you look at the percentage of individuals that are playing video games [59 percent] and overlay that with the percentage of individuals that have chronic conditions or need some assistance from the medical perspective [45 percent], the relationship is pretty strong,"" says Willis Gee, director of information technology strategy and innovation at health insurer Cigna.

On one level, it's about competition. The Affordable Care Act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans. Cigna has to find ways to stand out.

""People want to do things that are fun,"" says Gee. ""So, we have to be there with them.""

It might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters. But Gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs — by promoting exercise and preventing disease, for example, or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take.

""As an industry, we're going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is we're really trying to do,"" he says. ""And if, at the end of the day, the goal is about improving health, then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes.""

Drug companies are keeping an eye on these games, too. Pfizer partnered with the Project Evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials — helping to make them faster, cheaper and more efficient.

Right now, screening for Alzheimer's is subjective. Patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention. The results are often inaccurate. Some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having Alzheimer's at all. Dr. Michael Ehlers, Pfizer's chief scientific officer for neuroscience, says Project Evo could help them identify better candidates more quickly.

""I'd like to think we could cut down standard clinical trials, in size and length of time, by half or more,"" he says.

In terms of the game replacing drugs someday, though, Ehlers isn't so sure. He has a different analogy.

""It's just essentially a digital version of otherwise typical kinds of psychological and cognitive behavioral therapy,"" he says.

But, Ehlers still thinks game designers should go through the same FDA tests and trials as drug manufacturers.

""Quite important is that we hold them to the same standard of evidence that they actually work,"" he says.

Here, Ehlers touches on a broader controversy around games like Project Evo. There are several scientists who say this field is so new that it's lacking in good evidence that brain changes actually occur.

Randall Engle of the Georgia Institute of Technology believes giving the game FDA approval could hinder good science.

""Because it's a proprietary thing at that point — and that's a problem. If it becomes proprietary, the only people who can do unfettered research on it are the people who own the procedure,"" he says.

But, then again, that's exactly how it works with drugs.",'Play This Video Game And Call Me In The Morning',2,Autism
story_reviews_00563,"(Reuters Health) - When the results of a test wouldn’t change how doctors manage a patient’s care, most say it’s not worth doing. But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds.

The BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well.

Earlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf).

“There’s a lot of controversy even among experts,” said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W. Ellisen of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston.

For 15 years, at-risk women have only been tested for BRCA1 and 2, but many companies now offer multi-gene panels for 20, 25 or 30 other genes, Ellisen told Reuters Health.

“Are patients better off getting these much broader tests?” he said. “Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?”

According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said.

Several of the authors of the new paper disclosed that they receive research funding, consult for or are employed by genetic testing companies like Myriad Genetics and Invitae Corporation.

Between 2001 and 2014, the study team did panel tests for 25 or 29 genes on 1,046 women who were referred for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer gene testing, but had tested negative for BRCA mutations. Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already.

The researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes.

Including another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology.

Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said.

Often these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said.

Multigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said.

Though these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said.

“We do not advocate for broad population-based screening,” he said. “The interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing.” The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said.

“Many cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,” Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper.

“Yet thousands of women and their physicians are ignoring this advice, ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,” Swisher writes. “The train has left the station and is unlikely to return,” so it is important to assess how useful this additional testing can be, she concludes.

story_reviews_00564,"Correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the person who designed the MMSE test. This version has been corrected.

A small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.

Cerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non­invasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.

The federal government’s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer’s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.

[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer’s disease]

“Look, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,” said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. “What we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.”

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer’s, a person’s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.

Duffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people’s memory and ability to think.

With Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.

“All perception is interpretive, and so what we’re doing is measuring that process,” Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.

Cerebral Assessment Systems’ device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.

The Pittsford, N.Y.-based company’s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).

The device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.

Linda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.

But her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.

“You have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,” she said.

But the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it’s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s.

“I think it’s a really potentially valuable tool,” said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.

Algase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE. But she said it’s more convenient and less time-consuming to administer.",FDA approves tool for diagnosing dementia in a doctor’s office,2,Alzheimer's

TUESDAY, Aug. 11, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Colonoscopy can save lives, but experts agree that testing rates remain too low. Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most.

The system might also make colon cancer screening more efficient and boost the number of people who get checked for the disease, said a team led by Dr. Thomas Imperiale of Indiana University Medical Center, in Indianapolis.

One expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50.

""Five percent of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with colon cancer within their lifetimes,"" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was not involved in the new research.

Swaminath noted that one study published in 2012 found that ""colonoscopy reduced the risk of death from colon cancer by 53 percent, by removing polyps. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon.""

And while some areas of the United States have rates of compliance with colonoscopy guidelines of 75 percent or more, ""many areas have poor colon cancer screening rates,"" he added.

Imperiale's team noted that not all people deemed to be at ""average risk"" for colon cancer face the same risk of the disease, and so some might benefit more from invasive colonoscopy than others.

In the new study, the Indiana researchers looked at more than 4,400 Americans who were scheduled to undergo their first screening colonoscopy. They calculated a clinical ""score"" for each of these patients, based on their health information, and the five most common risk factors for colon cancer: age, sex, waist size, smoking and family history.

Then they looked at the results of each patient's colonoscopy. The study found that patients classified under the scoring system as low-risk did, in fact, have far fewer advanced abnormal growths that might develop into cancer, compared to patients classified as high-risk.

So, patients scoring at the lower end of risk for colon cancer might be able to have less invasive screening tests (such as the fecal occult blood test), while those at higher risk would require a colonoscopy, Imperiale's team concluded.

However, Swaminath wasn't fully sold on the notion.

He believes that the scoring system ""was only modestly able to separate people within the risk groups."" Swaminath pointed out that even the new study found that ""low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer.""

For now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations.

Dr. Jules Garbus is co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He seemed more supportive of the new scoring system.

""A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients,"" Garbus said. ""While high-risk patients may ultimately require a screening colonoscopy, many average- and low-risk patients could undergo less invasive screening procedures. This can improve patient compliance with screening, as well as address escalating health care cost issues.

The study is published Aug. 10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

story_reviews_00566,"Previous research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer’s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.

As Alzheimer’s disease progresses, cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships. A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer’s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.

Advertisement

“No one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,” said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. “Some past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer’s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.”

Members of Williams’s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.

In analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they’d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate — for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.

The caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners’ efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners’ versions of past events. This showed that they “value the relationship more than being right,” Williams said.

Some of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer’s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.

“The reality is, a person with dementia isn’t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,” Williams said. “At the same time, people with Alzheimer’s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it’s unexpected. These are moments that caregivers can cherish.”

story_reviews_00567,"Like many breast cancer survivors, 34-year-old Lisa Elliot was prescribed tamoxifen, a hormone therapy drug used to prevent the disease from returning. But after a year on the anti-estrogen medication, she started experiencing menopause-like side effects.

“One of the symptoms that was the worst for me, that nobody ever mentioned, was the vaginal atrophy part of it,” Elliot told FoxNews.com. “That was really detrimental to my life, way more so than hot flashes were.”

Vaginal atrophy often occurs after menopause when a woman's estrogen levels decrease, which leads to a thinning of the vaginal wall. Some studies estimate it can affect up to 60 percent of postmenopausal women. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, irritation, itchiness, painful intercourse, and frequent urination.

Elliott’s symptoms started to impact her day-to-day life to the point where sitting in a chair felt extremely uncomfortable. Sex with her boyfriend also became terribly painful and even caused disputes in her relationship, she said.

“It was probably one of the reasons why that relationship didn't continue. To be in your late twenties, early thirties and say to your partner, ‘I'm sorry we can't ever have sex-- ever again, it’s just too painful,’ there's a lot of distrust that develops,"" Elliott said. “It was a question of, ‘Well are you not attracted to me? Is there somebody else?’ And that wasn't the case at all.”

Despite the dire conditions, only 20 to 25 percent of postmenopausal women seek treatment. Estrogen replacement therapy is commonly used to cure the condition, but it is not recommended for all patients. Since many breast cancers are fed by estrogen, these drugs are not safe for women like Elliott.

Doctors may also propose vaginal moisturizers and lubricants to help, but when these over-the-counter options were ineffective for Elliott, her doctors suggested the MonaLisa Touch, a laser treatment.

“This is a unique fractional carbon dioxide laser that's been utilized for many many years in the face, and in the neck to revitalize that skin,” Dr. Mickey Karram, the director of urogynecology at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati Ohio, told FoxNews.com.

The therapeutic laser has been available in Italy for several years, but it was only recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

“The skin becomes more lubricated; the actual skin surface thickens, becomes less sensitive, and becomes more pliable. It basically restores everything that you would see in that vaginal canal when the woman had normal circulating estrogen,” Karram, who authored the first U.S. clinical trial on the treatment, said.

During the procedure, the laser probe is inserted into the vagina and releases photon energy to the skin to stimulate the production of collagen.

“It initiates a process that starts to produce more cells that are important for that skin to be revitalized. And most of that is around collagen, and a material called glycogen, and these fibroblasts that get circulated,” Karram said. “Once the process gets going, within days usually a woman feels there's more lubrication.”

The laser technology is administered by a trained obstetrician or gynecologist, takes about five minutes, and does not require anesthesia. Women receive three laser sessions spaced six weeks apart and once yearly afterward.

Some experts do warn that further long-term efficacy and safety tests need to be done. To date, there has not been a placebo controlled trial or head-to-head trials with any other treatments, but those studies are in the process of being completed, Karram said.

Karram’s initial U.S. studies have shown some encouraging results with patients showing 85 to 90 percent improvement of all symptoms.

“In my 15 patients, 13 were basically cured and felt that all of their symptoms had resolved. Two of the patients had a few residual symptoms, but had significant improvement,” he said.

After a session, women may experience some spotting as a potential side effect and doctors do tell patients to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 24 to 72 hours after. The office-based procedure itself, however, is seemingly painless, Karram said.

“The insertion of the laser does hurt a little bit— it's like getting a pap smear,” Elliott said. “But the lasering itself doesn't. It feels just fine. And in fact, right afterwards you feel fine too, there's no residual pain.”

Elliott admitted she was skeptical of how effective the laser treatment would be, but after completing her three sessions she is more than happy she tried it.

“I feel amazing. I feel like I did before the atrophy, before the tamoxifen, before all of the bad stuff,” Elliott said. “Today I have a confidence that I didn't have for a very long time because I know that I can be sexually active with somebody that I care about and I don't have to worry about being broken.”

The MonaLisa Touch therapy can cost up to $3,000 and it is not covered by insurance.

The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.

The researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.

""What we found was a little surprising,"" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.

Based on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.

AD

They also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.

AD

Bechtold said the researchers wanted to ""help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana"" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.

One major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s ""which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,"" the authors acknowledge. ""Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.""

AD

Update: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.

story_reviews_00569,"The Claim: Red palm oil, a deep orange fat pressed from the palm tree fruit, is a superfood—packed with healthy antioxidants and good for the heart, say companies who sell it.

The Verdict: The colorful oil is rich in tocotrienols, nutrients in the vitamin E family, and carotenoids, which the body converts into vitamin A. Several studies suggest possible benefits in stroke and liver disease from vitamin extracts made from the oil, but so far there isn’t proof that consuming the oil can ward off disease, scientists say.

“There’s not enough evidence to say that it’s good for health, but if you like the flavor of it, now and then for an indulgence, I think it’s OK,” says Penny M. Kris-Etherton, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University.

Red palm oil is produced in several areas, including Malaysia, West Africa and Ecuador. Oil pressed from the flesh of the fruit of the palm tree is naturally a deep orange color. But most palm fruit oil is bleached and refined at high temperatures, resulting in a yellow oil used in the food and cosmetics industries, says Johari Minal, Washington, D.C., regional manager of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, a government agency that promotes the country’s palm-oil industry. Red palm oil is refined either at lower temperatures or not heated at all during final processing, causing it to retain color and nutrients, he says.

Flavors vary depending on the processing. Ola-Ola Carotino oil, $6.99 for 35.2 ounces, is heated briefly during refining and has a bland, neutral flavor comparable to other cooking oils, says Unnikrishnan R. Unnithan, executive director of Malaysia’s Carotino Sdn. Bhd.; the company also sells a more flavorful version intended for ethnic cooking.

Other oils, such as Nutiva Inc.’s red palm oil from Ecuador, $8.99 for 15 ounces, are filtered instead of heated during refining. Nutiva’s oil has a flavor some people say is like spicy carrots. It can be used as a salad dressing and drizzled on hummus and popcorn, says Nutiva Chief Executive John W. Roulac.

A tablespoon of red palm oil is about 130 calories, similar to other oils. About 40% of red palm oil is oleic acid, an unsaturated fat present in higher quantities in olive oil and believed to be part of the reason for its heart benefits. Palmitic acid—a saturated fat that makes up about another 40% of red palm oil and was long considered to be implicated in heart disease—is “neutral at best” based on newer evidence, says David L. Katz, director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. Healthwise, red palm oil is clearly preferable to oil made from the kernel, which is about 80% saturated fat and widely used in packaged foods, Dr. Katz says. But compared with known healthy oils such as olive, walnut, avocado and canola oil, which is rich in omega-3s, benefit is “by no means obvious,” he adds.

The best case for a health benefit for red palm oil comes from its high vitamin content. A tablespoon of Nutiva oil contains 25% of the recommended daily serving of vitamin E and 240% of the recommended daily serving of vitamin A. According to a 2010 review published in the Journal of American College of Nutrition, scientists in developing countries have found Carotino and other red palm oils to be an effective method of treating vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to blindness.

Red palm oil contains various types of vitamin E, including four tocotrienols, antioxidants some scientists think may be good for the cardiovascular system. In a two-year, 121-person study published in 2014 in the journal Stroke, a tocotrienol-rich dietary supplement made from red palm oil reduced “white matter lesions,” or small areas of damage to the brain that can be caused by strokes so minor a person might not be aware they happened; such small strokes can lead to cognitive impairment. The tocotrienols appear to have had a “protective effect” resulting in less damage to brain tissues from the strokes, says co-author Kah Hay Yuen, a professor at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.

The study was funded by the Malaysian palm board and Dr. Yuen is a paid consultant to Hovid Bhd., which sells the supplement; the same ingredient is available in the U.S. from various companies under the names EvNol Suprabio and Tocomin Suprabio, says Bryan See, a U.S. regional product manager for Malaysia’s ExcelVite Sdn. Bhd., which supplies the ingredient. A 2013 study, also co-written by Dr. Yuen, found a beneficial effect on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Deforestation by palm-oil producers, harming wildlife habitats, has been a world-wide concern. A Page One article in The Wall Street Journal last week explored reports of forced labor and poor conditions for migrant workers on Malaysian palm oil plantations. All red palm oil from Malaysia, including Carotino, is produced by companies certified by the not-for-profit Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as using sustainable methods and using legal workers who make at least minimum wage, says the Malaysian palm oil board’s Mr. Minal. The Roundtable’s members include palm-oil producers and processors, consumer-goods manufacturers and some environmental and social groups. Nutiva says its oil is sustainably produced by family farms in Ecuador and workers are paid more than local minimum wage.

story_reviews_00570,"LONDON (Reuters) - A “brain training” iPad game developed in Britain may improve the memory of patients with schizophrenia, helping them in their daily lives at home and at work, researchers said on Monday.

Scientists at Cambridge University said tests on a small number of patients who played the game over four weeks found they had improvements in memory and learning.

The game, “Wizard”, is designed to help so-called episodic memory — the type of memory needed to remember where you left your keys several hours ago, or to remember a few hours later where you parked your car in a multi-storey car park.

Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, ranging from changes in behavior through to hallucinations and delusions.

While some psychotic symptoms can be reasonably well treated with medication, patients often still have debilitating problems with memory and cognitive function, meaning they struggle to get back to work or stay in education.

There is increasing evidence that computer-assisted training can help people with schizophrenia overcome some of their symptoms, with better outcomes in their daily lives.

This study, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that 22 patients who played the memory game made significantly fewer errors and needed significantly fewer attempts to remember the location of different patterns specific tests.

They also improved their scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, which doctors use to rate the social, occupational and psychological functioning of adults.

Importantly, the patients also said they enjoyed the game and were motivated to play it across the eight hours of cognitive training. The researchers said this was important, since lack of motivation is a common feature of schizophrenia.

“We need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with episodic memory, but slow progress is being made toward developing a drug treatment,” said Barbara Sahakian from the department of psychiatry at Cambridge University.

“This proof-of-concept study...demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed. (And) because the game is interesting, even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training.”",Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia,1,Reuters

WEDNESDAY, July 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of a temporary, implanted balloon device for weight loss may have many wondering how -- and how well -- it works.

Called the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System, the device consists of two connected balloons filled with saline. The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday.

But the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,"" Roslin said, ""but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity.""

""I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,"" he added. ""I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly.""

In a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston.

The device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.

It's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said.

Doctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system.

The device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed.

A pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained.

With ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device.

Nausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce.

""The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,"" Roslin said.

Another troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial.

Roslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. ""It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

The balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California.

The people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said.

In the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.

The results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years.

Paul Workman, professor and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in a statement accompanying the publication of the journal article that ""the evidence on aromatase inhibitors has been accumulating for well over a decade, but it has taken this huge and complex study to make sense of all the data, and provide a firm basis for clinical guidelines.”

""It tends to be the discovery of new treatments that grabs the headlines, but it is just as important to maximize the benefit patients get from existing treatments through major, practice-changing studies like this,"" Workman said.

The researchers wrote in the study that a substantial number of the trial participants switched from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors after they heard that it could reduce recurrence, which affected their results. If this had not happened, ""the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater,"" they surmised.

A separate analysis by the same group, also published in The Lancet, looked at bisphosphonates, which are typically used for osteoporosis. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent.

Using the two drugs together as a one-two punch may be even more powerful.

Richard Gray, a professor at the University of Oxford and who served as the lead statistician for both studies, said that half of all women with breast cancer are postmenopausal with hormone-sensitive tumors and could potentially benefit from both drugs.

story_reviews_00573,"A scourge we can eliminate, if we choose wisely: the human papillomavirus. Photo by the Laboratory of Tumor Virus Biology

Through an article in Forbes I saw that a new study has been published about the safety of Gardasil, a vaccine for prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV.

HPV is a virus that can lead to genital warts, many types of cancer, and cervical cancer in women, which kills 4,000 women every year in the U.S. alone.

The Gardasil vaccine, on the other hand, caused some people to faint after getting it, and others got mild skin infections—both of which occur somewhat rarely with other vaccines too, as you might expect.

Which sounds worse to you?

The study, published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, looked at the published data about effects from the vaccine and found that it has a “favorable safety profile.” This study comes after many other previous studies that show essentially the same thing. There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as “autoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.”

Mind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.

That doesn’t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.

It’s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it’s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.

Even more frustrating about this vaccine is that it’s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.

However, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.

It’s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.

And yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).

But that’s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.

That’s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we’d have done that if she had been a boy, too). As a parent, as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder, and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented, I am a strong advocate for vaccinations.

It’s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you. Don’t listen to the anti-vaxxers, who just want to scare you. Get the facts. And please, talk to your board-certified doctor and find out if there are any vaccinations you need.

How many lives will you save when you do?

story_reviews_00574,"WASHINGTON—People with mild Alzheimer’s disease who started taking an experimental Eli Lilly LLY -0.70% & Co. drug earlier in the course of their disease fared better than patients who started later in a clinical trial.

The outcome may bolster the company’s case that the drug, solanezumab, can slow the decline of memory and function in mild Alzheimer’s patients, despite prior studies with negative results. But the new data aren’t final proof of the drug’s benefit—a separate, continuing study due to end in late 2016 is designed to more definitively test its efficacy and safety.

In other studies, Biogen Inc. BIIB -0.13% announced some new data suggesting that its experimental Alzheimer’s drug slowed the progression of the disease, while researchers said a clinical trial of a Roche Holding AG compound indicated the therapy reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease.

Results of these studies were presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Washington. The data are largely incremental but were still being watched keenly by investors, who are looking for signals of potential success after years of failed drug candidates in the Alzheimer’s space.

The drug-industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, recently released a report calculating that 123 experimental therapies for Alzheimer’s failed between 1998 and 2014 while only four drugs made it to market.

Lilly hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer’s can alleviate symptoms but don’t slow underlying disease progression.

Jefferies & Co. analyst Jeffrey Holford estimates the Lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than $3 billion world-wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators. A leading theory in Alzheimer’s research is that the buildup of a sticky protein known as beta amyloid in the brain contributes to the disease. Lilly’s solanezumab is designed to bind to amyloid and clear it from the brain.

But the amyloid hypothesis hasn’t been proven in clinical trials. In two large clinical trials reported in 2012, solanezumab failed to significantly slow the decline of cognition and functional abilities among the overall population of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, compared with a placebo. Other companies’ drugs targeting amyloid also have failed in trials.

Lilly scientists, however, said the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in a subgroup: patients with a mild form of the disease. The company has continued developing the drug in mild Alzheimer’s patients.

Since 2012, Lilly has continued to provide the drug to patients who received it in the earlier trials, and patients who originally received a placebo in those studies were allowed to switch over to solanezumab. On average, the placebo patients started solanezumab 18 months after the earlier patients.

The new results showed that the patients who started therapy earlier retained an advantage in cognition and daily function over those who started later, and that this difference persisted for two years.

Researchers said such a finding is consistent with the hypothesis that solanezumab is modifying the underlying disease. Some patients receiving solanezumab experienced swelling in the brain and other adverse events, but researchers said the drug was generally well tolerated.

“Here we have a safe antibody treatment, solanezumab, that appears to benefit mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia subjects,” said Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, who presented the results.

Eric Siemers, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Lilly, said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but “we’ll find out if it works or not” when a separate, continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of 2016.

In March, Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., announced some results from an early-stage clinical trial that showed its drug, aducanumab, given to a very small group of participants with mild memory problems appeared to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain. The treatment also appeared to slow down cognitive decline—particularly at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg—in these people.

The results impressed Wall Street and lifted the company’s stock to all-time highs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates annual sales of the Biogen drug could top $10 billion if it reaches the market. The March findings, however, didn’t include all doses of medication at the 12-month time point.

Aducanumab is an antibody that is thought to bind to sticky clumps of the protein amyloid in the brain and causes cells to digest away the plaque and reduce amyloid, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer.

On Wednesday, researchers presented Biogen’s full one-year data of all four medication doses at one year of treatment, as well as more participants in the placebo arm of the study. The results were largely consistent with the March analyses.

“I breathed a huge sigh of relief” after seeing the Biogen data, said Mark Schoenebaum, biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst at Evercore ISI.

With a Roche compound called gantenerumab, new results in a subset of participants of the biomarker and brain imaging data showed that the compound did appear to reduce amyloid plaque as hypothesized, nearly two years after the start of treatment.

A trial of the therapy was discontinued in December 2014 after a preplanned look at the data in the middle of the study suggested the treatment wasn’t making an impact on cognition.

That means the compound appears to work the way it is theorized to, yet still didn’t appear to influence cognitive decline, raising questions about whether removing amyloid plaque yields a benefit on cognition.

Philip Scheltens, Director of the Alzheimer Center at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, who presented the data to media, said the findings suggested the doses tested were too low to be effective.

A researcher at Switzerland-based Roche announced Wednesday it is going to investigate a higher dose of the compound in an extension of the trial.

Researchers at Axovant Sciences of Bermuda, whose drug candidate RVT-101 works on neurotransmitters in the brain, presented a new analysis of data from its previously reported clinical trial. These data, which included only the participants to finish the trial, were consistent with previously announced data, which included everyone who started the trial whether they dropped out or not.

Researchers at the University of Alberta have developed a pill using egg yolk antibodies that helps coat gluten, allowing it to pass from the body without doing any damage, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported.

“My friend is celiac. We haven’t had any entertaining with beers. So that’s why I developed this pill – for my friend,” Hoon Sunwoo, an associated professor of pharmaceutical sciences at UAlberta, told the CBC.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in the small intestine that makes patients sensitive to gluten. Patients would take Sunwoo’s pill five minutes before eating and have a one-to-two hour window of eating foods they typically avoid, the CBC reported.

However, Sunwoo warns the pill is neither a long-term solution for patients nor is it a cure for the disease— just an aid to help improve quality of life.

story_reviews_00576,"There was a time when the optimal exercise speed was however fast you had to run to get away from a saber-tooth tiger. Even today, in much of the developing world, people exercise through activities such as farming and fetching water that are necessary for survival.

However, in the developed Western world, where exercise tends to be an extracurricular activity, there is apparently tremendous interest in just how fast you should move in order to improve your health. Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times’ Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the “right dose of exercise,” “walk hard, walk easy”), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.

So is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?

To analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended — basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.

The way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET — metabolic equivalent of task — which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity’s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.

The goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won’t say anything about other kinds of exercise — no yoga or SoulCycle — though these have their own MET measures.

Let’s first look at the results from two papers — here and here — that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.

Doing this analysis is a little complicated. You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can’t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers — and basically all the others we’ll look at here — therefore report their results in “hazard ratios.” A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you’ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you’d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.

This research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don’t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.

Walking a bit farther — say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph — gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.

Other studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.

Many of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.

At first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you’d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.

Broadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running — even slowly, like 5 mph — is far more energy-intensive than walking. An energy expenditure of 1.19 METs per day (the lowest-energy-expenditure group in the second study here) means about 20 minutes of running a 12-minute mile, three times a week.

Slow running like this appears to have a much larger impact on mortality than walking. A hazard rate of 0.48 — compared with a sedentary group — suggests a much larger reduction in the risk of death than a hazard rate of 0.90. What is a bit surprising about this chart is that running faster or farther doesn’t seem to reduce death rates any more than running slowly and, in fact, in both cases is slightly worse.

In one of these studies it looks like running very intensely (faster than an eight-minute mile, more than four hours a week) increases your risk of death relative to not running at all. But a closer look at the data suggests that this is probably just a statistical artifact: This intense running group contains only 36 people and two deaths, versus hundreds of people in the more casual running groups.

Even if we dismiss the possibility that running harder is worse, it is probably useful to note that running harder or farther doesn’t seem to be better. I have occasionally felt guilty about my thrice-weekly 25-minute runs, especially in comparison to my brother, who runs a 2:45 marathon and once attempted the Leadville Trail 100. It is comforting to know that I can still outlive him.

One general problem with all of this research is that none of these studies is randomized. People who exercise are different from those who do not, and those who exercise more are different from those who exercise less. This should, as usual, give us some pause in trumpeting the virtues of exercise. However, I’d argue that the comparisons the studies make among runners are still valid.

To be more concrete: In most of these studies, the more intense runners are healthier (for example: less likely to smoke and thinner) than the less-intense runners. We may tend to attribute the health of this group to their running habits. The fact that even with this bias we see no large benefit — indeed, seemingly no benefit at all — to running more rather than running less reinforces the value of moderate running.

If we take this research at face value, we learn a few things. First, some exercise reduces your risk of death. Second, the optimal walking/jogging exercise is light to moderate jogging. The optimal speed is between 5 and 7 mph, and if you do 25 minutes about three times a week, you’re all set. Nothing in the data suggests that running more — farther, or faster — will do more to lower your risk of death.",What’s The Optimal Speed For Exercise?,4,FiveThirtyEight.com

SUNDAY, July 19, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- It's still very early, but scientists say a test based on a patient's saliva might someday help detect Alzheimer's disease.

""Saliva is easily obtained, safe and affordable, and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline, but we're in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed,"" study author Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta in Canada, said in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association.

The study was to be presented Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C. Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

In the study, Sapkota's team tested the saliva of 22 people with Alzheimer's disease, 25 people with what's known as mild cognitive impairment (a decline in memory and thinking that's sometimes a precursor to dementia), as well as 35 people whose mental skills were normal for their age.

They found that the saliva of people with Alzheimer's had different levels of certain substances compared to the saliva of healthy people or those with mild cognitive impairment.

Experts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed.

""This is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive,"" said Dr. Allison Reiss, head of the Inflammation Section at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.

She believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors -- things such as ""coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables"" that could influence what's found in the saliva samples.

""There are many gaps in the evidence,"" Reiss said. ""It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer's risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study.""

Still, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research ""is still in its infancy but very promising.""

If a saliva test lives up to its promise, one advantage is ""the ease of obtaining a sample,"" he said.

But that convenience also brings its own problems, Wright added. People might ask for a test even when they don't show any signs of dementia, and ""this may result in anxiety and depression if there is a false positive result,"" he said.

For that reason, ""larger studies are needed to corroborate and validate their findings,"" Wright said.

story_reviews_00578,"The latest advances in Alzheimer’s disease involve people who don’t appear to show any signs of cognitive decline yet. Experts now believe that the biological processes behind the neurodegenerative condition begin years, if not decades, before memory problems and confusion become noticeable.

At the annual Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging, those with mild cognitive dementia (MCI, which in some cases can lead to Alzheimer’s and in other cases not), and Alzheimer’s disease.

Presenting at the meeting, Shraddha Sapkota, a graduate student in neuroscience at University of Alberta, and her colleagues described how they carefully analyzed the saliva of a group of volunteers participating in an aging study. Some had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and some with MCI, while others did not have any neurological conditions. By comparing their saliva components, the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds, which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.

The results aren’t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, but that’s the goal, says Sapkota. Ideally, for example, isolating those with MCI might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing.

story_reviews_00579,"A popular new type of prenatal test intended to find genetic flaws in a fetus can in rare cases also reveal previously undiagnosed cancer in the mother.

The unexpected finding emerged in a study involving eight women who initially had abnormal results from the prenatal blood test, but for whom a subsequent assessment showed their babies were normal. When the mothers’ DNA was reanalyzed, researchers said, the anomalies were linked to cancer in each of the women.

Researchers said the report, presented Monday at a meeting of the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis in Washington, D.C., underscores both challenges and opportunities for the tests, which have altered the prenatal testing landscape since they first hit the market in 2011.

Related JAMA study

The noninvasive prenatal blood tests can detect evidence of fetal abnormalities in the blood of a pregnant woman. That enables doctors to determine whether a fetus is at risk for such genetic abnormalities as Down syndrome with a blood test rather than with more invasive amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling that can, in rare cases, induce miscarriages.

But as the new study shows, the unique ability to analyze both maternal and fetal DNA at the same time can lead to surprising results. “When the test first came out we didn’t think about cancer being a possibility,” said Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, Boston. “I’ve been working in this field for 25 years, and it’s something that we never expected to find.”

Dr. Bianchi is lead author of the study, which was also published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association.

While the noninvasive tests are considered highly accurate, Dr. Bianchi said the new findings underscore the need to have any positive result confirmed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling diagnostic test before considering whether to terminate a pregnancy or to plan for a child with developmental disabilities.

“Most of the time, the results do confirm the screening test,” she said, but it is possible the initial result “may have nothing to do with the fetus.”

The tests are recommended only for women considered at high risk of carrying fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities, but they have been rapidly adopted by clinicians and patients. Since they first came on the market in 2011, more than 2 million tests have been performed world-wide, Dr. Bianchi said.

Leading marketers of the tests are Illumina Inc., which funded the study, and Sequenom Inc., both in San Diego.

The eight cases in the study came from a database of more than 125,000 blood samples submitted to Illumina between 2012 and 2014, of which 3,757, or 3%, were positive for at least one chromosomal abnormality associated with Down syndrome and other conditions. Among the very small number of instances where follow-up tests showed the fetus was normal, doctors later reported 10 cases of cancer.

Among the eight women studied, three had their cancers diagnosed because of the abnormal findings. “These women said they feel like their babies saved their lives because that was the finding that prompted the additional workup and treatment,” Dr. Bianchi said.

Unanticipated results from genetic tests, known as incidental findings, are the subject of ongoing debate among genetics experts and clinicians about the ethics of whether and how to divulge such information to patients. For instance, if a genetic test for a childhood disease turned up evidence of an elevated risk for breast cancer later in life, there is no consensus on when or how to inform the patient.

In the case of maternal cancer, “this is a very interesting incidental finding because it’s something that potentially you need to take immediate action about,” Dr. Bianchi said.

The full implications of the new findings need further study, said Roberto Romero, a perinatology researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues in an editorial accompanying the study. With the growing popularity of the noninvasive tests, there is increased need “to provide informed advice to potentially affected pregnant women” and to help guide their care, they said.

story_reviews_00580,"While prenatal testing is widely used for pregnant women at risk of having babies with chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome, new research shows certain types of tests may also reveal markers of cancer in mothers.

When Marin Mejia was pregnant with her son Owen, one such blood test that picks up DNA from mother and baby came back showing abnormal results. Further testing showed the baby was healthy.

But doctors told Mejia they needed to investigate what caused the irregular finding.

At the time she was 39 and had experienced bleeding she blamed on hemorrhoids. More testing showed she had anal cancer.

Recent research from Tufts Medical Center found evidence that these prenatal tests can detect cancers in pregnant women. The study, funded by Illumina, a maker of one non-invasive prenatal test, looked at eight women with abnormal test results. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""If there is cancer, the tumor is shedding DNA into the mother's blood as well and that is what is accounting for this imbalance,"" study author Dr. Diana Bianchi, who serves on an advisory panel for the company, told CBS News.

Mejia's cancer was advanced and it spread to her lymph nodes and lungs. Doctors delivered Owen at 32 weeks so she could begin chemotherapy and radiation.

""I am thankful for every minute I get to spend with them,"" she said. ""I refuse to believe that there's going to be any other outcome than 'it's all going to be okay' because the alternative is unfortunately not something I want to think about.""

story_reviews_00582,"A study published last year estimated that 56 million American adults, or almost half those age 40 to 75, would be advised to take statins under the new guidelines, compared with 43.2 million, or 37.5 percent, under the old ones. In actuality, about one in four adults of that age now take statins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The guidelines, issued by two leading cardiology societies in November 2013, move away from trying to lower cholesterol to particular target levels. Instead, patients are urged to consider statins if they have an overall risk of 7.5 percent of developing a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. The risk can be calculated using an online tool that considers such factors as gender, age, race, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking status.

The guidelines were contested almost as soon as they were announced. Critics said that the online calculator greatly overstated a patient’s risk of developing a heart problem and that new guidelines would lead millions of additional people to take statins, exposing them to potential side effects such as muscle pain or damage with little to gain.

That debate continues with the release of the new studies.

“These two articles indicate that the new guidelines allow you to treat more people and provide better results at a reasonable cost,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, who was not involved in the studies.

Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?

Not so fast.

Though women have been pummeled with information on sunscreen and other UV-protection products, few know what they can do to minimize sun damage after they go inside. Christine Lennon and Dr. Darrell Rigal join Tanya Rivero. Photo: Getty

A new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.

Her take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. “The message with…protection has been to stay out of [the sun],” said Ms. Peterson. “But I’m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it’s not realistic to say ‘no sun.’ ”

She is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you’re in the sun. (She’s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. “I spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,” she said.

Now, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day’s protective ministrations into nighttime.

This information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care—a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.

Ms. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line’s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed—all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.

When shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.

“ My kids are outside playing. I know that it’s not realistic to say “no sun.” ”

One Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand’s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. “Our lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,” she added.

After-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma’s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.

Not everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. “That can make sun-exposed skin feel better,” she said, “But there’s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.” And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits—and that antioxidants “are notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.”

But believers like True Nature Botanicals’ Ms. Peterson are undeterred. “In medicine, you need a definitive study,” she countered. “We can’t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better. But [by] bringing Omega-3 and -6 and antioxidants to the skin, we’re giving it more of the tools it needs to handle sun exposure.”",A New Frontier in Sun Protection,3,skin cancer/sun protection
story_reviews_00584,"Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn’t. But such talks, while encouraging, are still in the early stages, a Novartis spokesman said.

Timothy Anderson, pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a recent note that Entresto was “likely to become a mega-brand over time” but that the initial uptake was “likely to be on the slower side given the entrenched nature of off-patent ACE inhibitors.” He said it was highly unusual that there were no major competitors for Entresto on the way, giving it a “long runway.”

In a clinical trial with more than 8,400 participants, patients were randomly assigned to take either Entresto or enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit.

After about 27 months, 21.8 percent of those taking Entresto had either died from cardiovascular causes or had been hospitalized for worsening heart failure, compared with 26.5 percent for those taking enalapril. That represented a relative risk reduction of 20 percent using a measure known as the hazard ratio.

Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases.

The F.D.A. said that the main side effects were low blood pressure, high blood potassium levels and kidney impairment. It said there were also cases of angioedema, an allergic reaction that usually results in swelling of the lips or face but can be life threatening if swelling interferes with breathing. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said.

Entresto is a combination of two drugs, one of which is valsartan, the active ingredient in the blockbuster drug that Novartis sells as Diovan but which now faces generic competition.

MONDAY, July 6, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A scan of calcium deposits inside your arteries can help doctors deduce how long you're likely to live, a new study has found.

The test, called a coronary calcium scan, uses a regular CT scan to look for calcium deposits in the three major arteries that carry blood away from the heart, said lead author Leslee Shaw, a professor of cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta.

People with the largest amounts of calcium in their arteries carry an early death risk that's six times greater than those with no calcium deposits, researchers found in a 15-year study of nearly 10,000 patients.

""If you had no calcium or very small amounts, we were able to track over a very long time that you actually had a very outstanding survival,"" Shaw said.

Calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said.

These plaques, which are caused by blood cholesterol, build up over time and cause arteries to narrow, leading to heart disease as the heart works harder to pump blood through the body.

If a plaque bursts, a blood clot can form on its surface, blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.

To prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.

Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.

Up to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.

In this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.

Researchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.

Analysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries.

Patients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.

""This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,"" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.

Calcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.

""Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,"" he said. ""The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.""

The results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.

""It can be a very potent motivator,"" she said.

People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.

Shaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests. They generally cost less than $100, she said.

""I think it's headed that way,"" she said. ""We're kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted.""

The findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

story_reviews_00586,"A growing body of evidence suggests that weight-loss surgery is more effective than diet and exercise at getting rid of Type 2 diabetes.

A small but rigorous randomized trial published Wednesday in JAMA Surgery provides the latest evidence showing the superiority of bariatric surgery over lifestyle changes in resolving the chronic condition involving high blood sugar.

In the trial, 61 obese adults with diabetes were randomly assigned to one of two surgical procedures or intensive lifestyle intervention and followed for three years. Forty percent of those who had received a gastric bypass procedure and 29% who received a gastric band were considered in remission from diabetes and no longer needed to take medication after three years. In comparison, no one in the group who received intensive lifestyle intervention resolved their diabetes.

“I do think it adds strongly to the growing body of data that [surgery] should be considered” to treat people with obesity and diabetes, said Anita Courcoulas, head of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who led the study.

However, to conclude firmly that surgery is the better option, data from more patients across several different treatment centers, followed for up to seven years after surgery, is needed, according to Dr. Courcoulas. Her group is conducting such a study, along with researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle, the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston and the Cleveland Clinic.

The American Diabetes Association lists surgery as one option in its 2015 medical care guidelines for diabetic patients with a body-mass index over 35 but says there is insufficient evidence of benefit in those who are less overweight.

“In general, I agree that short-term outcomes for bariatric surgery...are more dramatic than that seen with lifestyle intervention,” wrote Jane Chiang, senior vice president for medical affairs and community information at the American Diabetes Association, in an email. However, “not everyone is a strong candidate for bariatric surgery.” Treatment should be tailored to each patient, she said.

The ADA’s Professional Practice Committee, which develops its medical guidelines, will carefully review the study and assess if any changes to clinical practice are warranted, according to Dr. Chiang.

In 2011, the International Diabetes Federation announced a position change stating that surgical options should be considered earlier on for eligible patients to help prevent complications from Type 2 diabetes.

The new study, which began in 2009, didn’t look at a bariatric surgery procedure that has become popular in recent years, known as the sleeve gastrectomy, said Dr. Courcoulas. However, a study by the Cleveland Clinic published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine did, and found a similar significant improvement in Type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery procedures, including the sleeve gastrectomy, over lifestyle intervention.

Why bariatric surgery clears up diabetes isn’t fully understood and patients have different degrees of response to the procedures, said Dr. Courcoulas. Patients who undergo surgery usually lose significantly more weight than those receiving lifestyle intervention, but their diabetes often clears up before they lose a significant amount of weight, suggesting that weight loss alone isn’t the reason.

Some doctors say gastric bypass surgery appears especially beneficial, possibly because the procedure involves reducing the stomach to the size of a small pouch and bypassing a portion of the intestine, which potentially changes certain gastrointestinal hormones or other factors.

Michel Gagner, a clinical professor of surgery at Florida International University who wasn’t involved in the study but wrote an editorial accompanying the piece in the journal, said bariatric surgery should be used much more widely to treat diabetes, the way that heart surgery was widely used to treat coronary artery disease.

“I don’t know how many studies we need to do to keep comparing the best medical treatment to surgery, but it’s clear to me that surgery is the only thing that offers resolution to diabetes,” said Dr. Gagner.

It takes up to 15 years and $5 billion for a new drug to make it through testing and earn approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Before researchers try a compound on humans, it’s tested at labs in petri dishes and on animals, such as mice and monkeys. More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don’t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans.

For some time, scientists have been searching for ways to cut down on the cost and failure rate of drug testing. Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a beautiful solution: Organs-On-Chips.

The clear and flexible polymer microchips are lined with human cells. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The institute’s goal is to create 10 different organ systems that can be joined together by blood vessel channels to simulate human physiology on a microscale and provide a cheaper, more reliable way to test new drugs.

Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week

The sophisticated architecture of these organs-on-chips—which are about the size of a thumb drive—has also earned the Wyss Institute recognition in the art world with a Design of the Year award from the Design Museum and placement in the Museum of Modern Art’s permanent collection.

“The real power of this approach is that you have a window to the inner workings of life,” says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor of Vascular Biology and of Bioengineering at Harvard University. “Anything you can ask at the molecular level, we could do in our chips.”

In 2008, the team built and tested its first “organoid” chip to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. It contains tiny channels separated by a porous membrane to create two distinct, hollow passageways—one lined with human lung cells and the other with capillary blood vessel cells. Air is suctioned through the side channels to emulate breathing. Ingber and his team introduced bacteria into the chip’s lung channel and white blood cells into the capillary channel. They observed that the white blood cells permeated the membrane and attacked the bacteria in the lung cell channel—exactly what would happen in human lungs fighting off an infection.

In another experiment, the team at Wyss filled a chip’s lung cell channel with interleukin 2, a chemotherapy drug known to cause pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. When air entered the lung cell channel, the channel filled with fluid and then blood clots—exactly what happens in the lungs of patients who develop this life-threatening condition. This proved the chips could provide real world information to scientists studying the effects of new drug compounds.

The project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also recently awarded the institute a $37 million grant to create chips representing nearly all systems in the body. Ingber says some scientists are interested in using the chips to conduct research that would be unethical if performed on people, such as studying the effects of gamma radiation on the human body.

Of course, the chips have limitations. “We can’t mimic consciousness; we can’t mimic compression on a joint,” says Ingber.

Danilo Tagle, associate director for special initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a division of the NIH, is spearheading a similar organ-on-chip project. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to “complement and supplement” animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The chips will also provide researchers with information on dosing at a much earlier stage in drug studies—particularly helpful because animals metabolize chemical substances at a different rate than humans. “You can go forward with a candidate drug with greater assurance and confidence that it will have the desired effect on humans,” says Tagle. “Biology is very complex.”

Incorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. Some companies are already trying out the concept. Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is using a version of the chips to understand how blood clots in the lungs. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.

Though there still aren’t enough data to prove the chips are reliable enough to put rodents out of a job, Ingber says it’s only a matter of time; they hope to have them tested and ready for market in two years. “The FDA has been very supportive,” he says. “They’ve told us if they are as good as animals that they would consider accepting data provided by a drug company from one of these models rather than an animal model.”",Organ-On-Chip Could Revolutionize Drug Testing,3,Newsweek
story_reviews_00588,"If mass mammography screening for breast cancer worked well, fewer women would die from the disease.

And yet, a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine has found something that may seem counterintuitive: More breast cancer screening didn't actually save lives. Screening did however lead to more ""overdiagnosis,"" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.

The research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers — but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).

You can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.

To be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.

But this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis.



The trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.

We have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer

The medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers — in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).

This raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are ""frustratingly broad"" — from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.

""Sadly,"" they write, ""we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.""



The authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease — such as those with a family history of breast cancer.



The US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 — who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer — the benefits of mass screening are less clear.

There are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening — even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.

For now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.

(Reuters) - Bayer Healthcare said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved using transvaginal ultrasound as an alternate test to confirm if the company’s Essure permanent birth control device has been placed properly.

Essure is a small metal coil inserted into woman’s fallopian tubes. But since its approval in 2002, women using the device have sent the FDA more than 5,000 complaints, ranging from pain and menstrual problems to pregnancies and even deaths.

Some of the complaints related to the placement of the device.

In a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), sound waves emitted from a probe placed in vagina help a physician check if Essure has been placed properly.

This test is an alternative to the generally-prescribed modified hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test in which an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes is used to check for proper device placement.

A woman using Essure must do a test to confirm that the device is properly placed within three months of the procedure and until she receives a confirmation from her doctor, she must use alternate birth control methods, Bayer said in a statement on Wednesday.

All physicians who offer Essure are expected to be trained to perform the TVU confirmation test by mid-2016, the company said.

The training will start in September, the same month the FDA will hold a public panel meeting to discuss the safety and effectiveness of Essure.",FDA OKs second test to see if Essure contraceptive is placed right,2,Reuters
story_reviews_00590,"(Reuters Health) – Patients who need to be rehospitalized within a month after major surgery have a lower risk of death over the next two months if they return to the hospital where they had the surgery rather than going to a different facility, according to a new study.

“Most clinicians or surgeons feel like if you take the time to do a big operation on someone, you know the area operated on, how the operations went, if there were complications,” lead author Dr. Benjamin S. Brooke of the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City told Reuters Health by phone.

Doctors who did not perform the surgery won’t have that context, which may explain part of the survival benefit of returning to the original hospital, he said.

He and his team analyzed Medicare claims data from 2001 to 2011 on patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after major surgeries, including coronary artery bypass surgery, removal of the colon or pancreas, and hip or knee replacement. More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month.

More than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery.

Those who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet.

“Patients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,” Drs. Justin B. Dimick and David C. Miller, both of the University of Michigan, wrote in an editorial.

Patients readmitted at the original hospital also tended to be readmitted one to two days earlier than those who ended up at different hospitals.

It might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals, where they don’t have a pre-existing relationship with a surgeon, and so treatment might be delayed, Dimick and Miller wrote.

“If you are a surgeon or clinician who takes care of this person, it’s intuitive that going back to that surgeon would influence how well they do,” Brooke said.

For complex operations, some patients will fly to prestigious hospitals from several hundred miles away, he said. If these patients have complications weeks later, they end up going to a local hospital, not the one where they had surgery.

“A lot of big Fortune 500 companies contract with bigger hospitals for patients undergoing major surgery,” Brooke said, noting the Wal-Mart has contracted with the Cleveland Clinic.

“Even if they live in the same city where they had their surgery, they might have to call an ambulance to pick them up, and the ambulance drivers don’t understand how important it is to take them to the same hospital,” he said.

Ambulance drivers and emergency department doctors should make every effort to get a patient who has had major surgery back to their original hospital, he said.

“A lot of readmissions are patients who have time to be transferred or triaged, if they are not bleeding to death or having a heart attack,” he said.

Patients should try to stay in the immediate vicinity of their surgical hospital for at least a week, Brooke said.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, June 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A device that grabs and drags a blood clot out through the blood vessels should be used to treat certain stroke victims, according to new guidelines issued by the American Heart Association.

Nearly nine out of 10 strokes are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the arteries supplying blood to the brain, the American Heart Association (AHA) said. Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain.

But when those drugs don't work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said.

Skilled surgeons run the device up through a person's arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot.

""If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,"" Powers said.

The new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke.

The AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added.

A number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA's new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology.

As with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said.

The guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta.

Local hospitals currently are urged to ""drip and ship"" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said.

Stent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use.

""These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,"" Kandzari said. ""They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,"" he explained.

Powers said, ""I think what's going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained. You need a lot of special training to get those catheters up into the brain and pull things out.""

The guidelines specifically recommend using a stent retrieval device for people who:

Didn't have any significant disability prior to their current stroke.

Received tPA within 4.5 hours of their stroke onset, and can start the procedure within six hours after stroke symptoms started.

Are at least 18 years old, as clinical trials have not been conducted with children.

Have imaging scans that show more than half of the brain on the side of the stroke is not permanently damaged.

Have a clot blocking a large artery supplying blood to the brain.

That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said.

The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said.

But clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner, Powers said.

""The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,"" he said. ""It's really, really good evidence.""

story_reviews_00592,"Doctors are experimenting with new technology that could give them a more complete view of the large intestine than ever before, improving the odds of finding potentially cancerous growths earlier.

Dr. Arie Kaufman of SUNY Stony Brook demonstrated the virtual colonoscopy for CBS New York's Dr. Max Gomez.

""We'll have both the computer and the doctors working in tandem to find polyps and find cancers,"" Kaufman said. He added it could lead to better and earlier detection of colon polyps.

Virtual colonoscopy screening uses CT scans to create color, 3D images of the colon, the final portion of the large intestine. Special computer animation enables a doctor to view the organ in remarkable detail. Regular colonoscopy physically examines the colon by inserting a lighted probe into the intestine and requires a sedative. Both have made early detection and treatment more precise.

This next step in virtual colonoscopy, called ""immersive colonoscopy,"" projects 3D images of the colon large enough to fill the walls of a room. Doctors can then ""walk through"" the colon and explore many different angles.

""We have the side view and the back view,"" said Kaufman. ""This will allow the physician to view 100 percent of the surface including lesions, which are hidden behind folds maybe seen on the side and back walls.""

Such highly specific screening may allow doctors to detect more abnormal growths, called polyps, when they are as small as .10 mm, so they can be removed before they become full-blown cancer tumors.

For the patient, a virtual colonoscopy is low risk but does involve additional exposure to radiation. It may need to be followed with the physical colonoscopy later, as well.

Colonoscopies are recommended for adults age 50 and over to help detect early signs of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death among the combined group of men and women who have cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The CDC says colonoscopy may also be recommended for people experiencing stomach pain, aches or cramps that don't go away, unexplained weight loss and blood in the stool. More routine DNA tests and stool sampling, which show signs of bleeding caused by irregular growths, can also help detect colon polyps and indicate that the need for a full colonoscopy.

The CDC says colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer cases by as much as 60 percent. This new wave of radiology-based colonoscopy could improve those odds further.","A virtual ""walk"" through the colon could detect cancer earlier",2,Cancer
story_reviews_00593,"You no longer live in a world where you can pretend you’re only eating for one; the trillions of bacteria in your gut, we now know, also feed on what you put in your mouth—and they behave very differently depending on what that is.

It’s increasingly clear that the composition of your gut bacteria likely influences your risk for many health problems, from obesity and type-2 diabetes and even certain autoimmune diseases. Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that’s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial—and how to protect them. A recent study published in The BMJ adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)

“You really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,” says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of The Good Gut. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.

The authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: Akkermansia muciniphila—a strain that’s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.

The people who had more Akkermansia in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high-Akkermansia group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. “We discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of Akkermansia were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.”

Higher levels of Akkermansia, the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.

The good news is that your initial Akkermansia levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of Akkermansia had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani’s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.

Now, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer Akkermansia alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. “If we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,” he says.

Here’s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. “That means if you’re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,” he says—the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. “Our diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.”

Sonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis—eat food depleted of dietary fiber—their gut microbes behave erratically. “They turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,” says Sonnenburg, “because that’s also a carbohydrate source and it’s kind of a fallback food for them.” In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It’s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. “We start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,” he says.

Loading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn’t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers—those, like inulin, which are added to foods—haven’t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. “All of the vegetables we’re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,” Sonnenburg says.

Nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber—as are vegetables. “You can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,” Sonnenburg says. “I find that a really nice way to eat—just kind of gorging myself on plant material.”

“I grew up in Bombay, India, and I’m known for my use of spice in food,” Cardoz, also a partner of White Street in New York City, told FoxNews.com. Cardoz credits his years in the kitchen with leading him to discover that spices were more than just color and taste.

“Turmeric is the yellow coloring that you find in most curries,” Cardoz said. “But what most people don’t know about turmeric is that it’s a great antioxidant, it’s got great anti-cancer properties.”

Adding freshly ground black pepper can strengthen the benefits of turmeric in some dishes, and even help prevent breast cancer tumors from growing, according to a study from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Cardoz creates combinations of healthy, cancer-fighting spices to increase their benefits. The fennel-ginger broth that accompanies his braised snapper can help to fight off harmful cancer cells.

Fennel, often used in Indian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cooking, contains anethole which restricts the adhesive properties of cancer cells. Ginger, another cancer-fighting spice, consists of not one, but two anti-cancer compounds called gingerol and zingerol which complement each other in the body.

“They are both antioxidants and anti-inflammatory,” Cardoz said.

Studies also show that capsaicin in chili peppers ignites the body’s fight against potential cancer cells. Studies have shown it can also dramatically reduce leukemia cells. Garlic, onions, shallots and leeks can also act as cancer preventers, while adding flavor to many everyday dishes.

But Cardoz warns not to overdo it, and adds that the key is to use all these spices within the restraints of a balanced diet.",Cancer-fighting spices offer flavorful way to eat healthy,2,Cancer
story_reviews_00595,"Researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston have identified a large and readily detectable molecule that circulates in the blood and has identified, with perfect accuracy and no false positives, the presence of pancreatic cancer in a small group of subjects.

Searching blood samples of pancreatic cancer patients and controls for a distinctive molecule given off by the malignancy, scientists were even able to distinguish subjects with benign pancreatic disease from those with early-stage cancer.

The telltale sign of pancreas cancer was found in protein- and nucleic-acid-filled sacs called exosomes, which circulate in the bloodstream. Spinning blood samples in a centrifuge, researchers found they could break open those sacs and readily detect a protein called glypican-1, which is overexpressed in breast and pancreatic cancers.

The finding “offers the possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer and help in designing potential curative surgical options,” the authors of the new research wrote. For a cancer that has already metastasized in four of five patients newly diagnosed, earlier detection holds a strong promise of improving pancreatic cancer’s dismal survival rate, they added.

Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of all common cancers in the United States. An estimated 44,000 are diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the country, usually when it has reached a very advanced stage and few treatment options are effective. Just 5% of those diagnosed with this form of malignancy survive five or more years.

Clotilde Thery, a cancer researcher at France’s Institut Curie, greeted the possibility with enthusiasm.

“The potential implications of such a test are huge,” Thery wrote in an editorial published alongside the study, in the journal Nature. Although she said its findings need to be replicated in much larger groups, she hailed the finding as “clinically important.”

UC San Francisco cancer physician Alan Venook cautioned, however, that much more needs to be known about the telltale sign of cancer explored in the new research before its lifesaving properties can be established.

“The issue is, can you detect these in patients that don’t have advanced cancer?” Venook said. “The answer is, we don’t know.” The numbers tested by the MD Anderson researchers -- 251 patients with pancreatic cancer (five of whom had very early lesions), 32 with chronic pancreatitis and 120 healthy controls -- aren’t nearly large enough to draw such conclusions. And getting a clear answer, Venook said, would probably require lengthy and expensive studies on very large populations.

FOR THE RECORD

June 25, 4:06 p.m.: An earlier version of this article underreported the number of people tested for the glypican-1 protein by the MD Anderson researchers. Participants with pancreatic cancer numbered 251, not 56; healthy controls numbered 120, not 20; those with chronic pancreatitis numbered 32, not six.

A protein present on tiny particles released by cancer cells may provide a way to detect pancreatic cancer in its earliest stage, when prospects for successful treatement are best, according to a study by researchers at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

The researchers found that the presence of the protein could distinguish with 100 percent accuracy whether patients had early stage pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis, a major risk factor for the cancer. Levels of the protein were markedly lower after surgical removal of a patient's tumors. The study was published in the June 24 issue of the journal Nature.

Pancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer, with only 4 percent of patients surviving five years after diagnosis. That is due in part to the lack of any easy way to detect the cancer in its earliest stages. The pancreas is located deep within the body, so early tumors cannot be seen or felt during routine physical exams. Patients usually have no symptoms until the cancer has spread.

Scientists have uncovered various markers that can be used to detect the cancer through a blood test, but those have been too unreliable to recommend widespread screening.

As a result, 80 percent of pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in later stages, when surgery is no longer an option.

The new finding could lead to a blood test that would allow doctors to screen for pancreatic cancer much more effectively. If such a test were developed, it would likely be used first to test patients at high risk for pancreatic cancer. If it can be shown that screening improved outcomes, it could one day be used to screen the general population.

""Studies comparing stage of disease with outcome following surgery suggest that death rates frompancreatic cancer would be reduced if the disease were diagnosed at an earlier stage,"" said Dr. Raghu Kalluri, chair of cancer biology at M.D. Anderson and a co-author of the study.

story_reviews_00598,"Annual incidence rate of developing a primary malignant brain tumor is 7/100,000n population, and the lifetime risk is 0.6 percent. In addition, metastases from systemic cancer to the brain are 10 times more common than primary malignancy of the brain. Brain tumors can develop in both males and females and at any age (though they're more common in adults). The most common type of primary malignant brain tumors is malignant glioma.

Brain tumors are diagnosed with clinical symptoms as well as advance imaging modalities of the brain, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

Conventional surgery is usually the first step to have tissue diagnosis and decrease the burden of tumor. However, it's not a cure for malignant brain tumors and is usually followed by other types of adjuvant treatments, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy. Not all brain tumors are amenable to conventional surgery, for multiple reasons – such as location in deep parts of the brain with limited surgical access or being adjacent to critical structures. In addition, in some conditions increased risk of morbidity is seen after surgery, like in recurrent tumors with prior radiation or surgery. These patients, especially in the recurrent setting, have limited treatment options.

Focused high-dose radiation like stereotactic radiosurgery is useful in brain metastasis and could be used as initial treatment. However, radiosurgery is not useful for malignant primary brain tumors like gliomas, and even in metastasis it does have variable degree of failure based upon the size of tumor and prescribed radiation dose.

Patients who are suffering from deep seated or recurrent primary brain tumors, as well as those with brain metastases who failed radiation, have limited options and may benefit from alternative treatments like laser ablation.

Laser ablation is a minimally invasive treatment modality for brain tumors that uses laser technology to increase the temperature of tumor and subsequently kill tumor cells. It also might have a role in enhancement of chemotherapy and radiation therapy effects by disruption of repair mechanisms in tumor cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels of brain. Unlike conventional surgery, it doesn’t need extensive surgical exposure. Actually, it works through a small stab incision in the skin and a small hole in the skull.

Laser probe will be inserted using intra-operative navigation, and controlled firing of the laser will cause an increase in the temperature of tumor and eventually destruction of tumor cells. Although this technology has been around for decades, new technical advancements like specific MR-thermometric scans during surgery have an almost real-time measurement of brain temperature and control of the extension of treatment field, which allows the robotic probe driver to change direction and the depth of laser probe during surgery to have complete coverage of the tumor. Plus, a completely newly designed laser probe with a built-in cooling system prevents excessive temperature of the probe during surgery, which has made a resurgence of this treatment modality for intracranial applications in recent years.

Since five years ago, when the NeuroBlate System was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, hundreds of patients with brain tumors who used to be considered inoperable underwent this procedure successfully with promising outcomes. It's especially crucial for patients with brain tumors in difficult-to-access locations, as well as for those who have experienced failure of prior radiation treatment.

Being a relatively new procedure, NeuroBlate doesn't yet qualify as a standard treatment for brain tumors. However, initial results have been promising, and further studies are on the way.",A Ray of Hope for Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors,2,Cancer

Co-author Valter D. Longo, who studies longevity, described the idea behind fasting as a way to ""reboot"" a person's body by clearing out damaged cells and regenerating new ones.

""It's about reprogramming the body so it enters a slower aging mode, but also rejuvenating it ..."" he said. ""It's not a typical diet because it isn't something you need to stay on.""

The diet described in the study -- which the researchers dubbed the ""Fasting Mimicking Diet"" -- isn't quite as extreme as actual fasting. It works like this:

For 25 days out of the month, dieters can eat as they normally would -- the good, bad and in-between. Then for day one of the diet, they would eat 1,090 calories: 10 percent protein, 56 percent fat and 34 percent carbohydrates. For days two through five, 725 calories: 9 percent protein, 44 percent fat, 47 percent carbohydrates.

In the study, participants consumed a lot of vegetable soup, kale crackers and chamomile tea. The calories consumed are 54 to 34 percent of what a typical person might eat in a day.

The participants in the study did this for three cycles or three months before the researchers measured them and found decreased risk factors and biomarkers for disease with no major adverse side effects.

Petronella Ravenshear, a nutritional therapist in London, told the Telegraph that the new diet ""is less of a stressor on the body than complete fasting.""

""It supplies most of the carbohydrates in the form of vegetables which are packed with phytonutrients and minerals and positively good for us, rather than grain-derived carbohydrates which don’t supply much except sugar,"" she said.

Around that time, in France, Dr. Alain Cribier, a cardiologist at Hôpital Charles Nicolle, in Rouen, was thinking along the same lines. He was a highly regarded, successful innovator, so he thought it would be easy to find a company.

“I started looking for companies to help me, but it was a complete failure,” he said. “All the companies in the United States and Europe and Japan, they have experts, and the experts are surgeons and they said it is absolutely not possible. We would kill the patients on the table.”

He joined forces with a former Johnson & Johnson executive, Stanton Rowe, who began making the rounds of venture capitalists. But, Mr. Rowe said, their response was always the same: “ ‘We will look into it.’ And who do they call? The surgeons. They told them all the reasons why it won’t work.”

Dr. Cohn, the Harvard heart surgeon, said he and his colleagues had good reasons to look askance. They thought it was strange that the old valve would just remain in the heart. They wondered why the new one would not fly off into the rush of blood being pumped into the aorta — after all, it was not being sewn in. And pushing a valve into an atherosclerotic artery? Pieces of plaque could break off and cause blood clots and strokes. Finally, he added, it would take patients away from surgeons.

“We were skeptical,” he said.

Two and a half years later, after Dr. Cribier had practiced inserting valves in sheep, a 57-year-old man arrived at his hospital needing an aortic valve, on the brink of death, with almost no heartbeat. He had so many medical problems — severe coronary artery disease, chronic pancreatitis — that surgery was not an option. Then again, no human had ever had a valve put in without surgery.

“I had to ask the patient his wish,” Dr. Cribier said. “His response was, ‘Please, please do it.’ ”

“It was the most stressful day for me,” he said. Sheep, he explained, do not develop aortic stenosis, and their anatomy is very different. “We were not sure we could translate it into man,” he said.",Building a Better Valve,4,heart disease
story_reviews_00601,"Story highlights A new study suggests antibiotics could be an alternative to appendectomy for people with simple cases of appendicitis

Antibiotic therapy could be less expensive, allow faster recovery, although questions remain over who are the best candidates for it

The study found that 27% of people who received antibiotics instead of surgery had a second case of appendicitis within a year

(CNN) Surgery to remove the appendix, called appendectomy, is the go-to treatment for patients with appendicitis and is one of the most common surgical procedures in the U.S. However, antibiotic drugs could take the place of surgery for the many patients who have mild cases of appendicitis, according to new research.

Researchers in Finland studied more than 500 adults who had uncomplicated appendicitis, meaning their appendixes had not ruptured and they had no signs of infection or other problems in their abdomens. Half of the patients received an appendectomy, which is the standard of care, while the other half got an IV of antibiotics for three days followed by antibiotic pills for a week.

The researchers found that 73% of the patients who took antibiotics recovered from appendicitis and did not need surgery for at least a year afterward. The rest of the patients -- who went on to have another case of appendicitis and need an appendectomy -- did not have a higher rate of complications than the patients who initially received surgery.

""This is quite a radical change in the line of thinking, because appendectomy has served patients well for over 100 years,"" said Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at the Turku University Hospital in Finland and lead author of the study, which was published on Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association . An editorial accompanying the study added, ""the time has come to consider abandoning routine appendectomy for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.""

The findings suggest that for patients with uncomplicated cases, who make up about 80% of the patients diagnosed with appendicitis, surgery may not be necessary, Salminen said. However, if the appendix has ruptured, emergency surgery must be done because patients can develop deadly infections in the abdomen and antibiotics alone are not strong enough to treat them, she added.

story_reviews_00602,"Just over a year ago, Catherine Price decided to start taking one of the cheapest, safest, oldest, most widely prescribed drugs for Type 2 diabetes. So much metformin is taken in the United States — some 72 million prescriptions were written for it in 2013 — that a recent study found higher trace levels of it (presumably from the urine of people taking it) in Lake Michigan than of any other drug, including caffeine.

But Price, a science and medical reporter in Oakland, Calif., doesn’t have Type 2 diabetes. She has Type 1, the far less common form of the disease, which requires lifelong treatment with insulin, to compensate for her body’s failure to produce enough of the hormone. However, she had read studies indicating that metformin combined with insulin might help Type 1 diabetics, too. Moreover, the drug was being studied in clinical trials as a way to lower the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia — not just for diabetics, but for everyone.

For Price, there was yet another possible benefit — as a treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome, an endocrine disorder that doctors thought might explain the difficulty she and her husband had had conceiving.

Sure enough, a month and a half after she had started taking metformin pills and even as she was enjoying the benefits of better blood-sugar control, Price became pregnant, eventually giving birth to a girl.

“I’m still taking metformin along with my insulin,” said Price, 36, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 14 years ago. “I remember eating Mexican food one night, which can be a potential disaster for people with diabetes because of the carbs, but I noticed I needed only two-thirds to a half of the insulin I normally needed.”

Synthesized in the 1920s, metformin was first approved for treatment of Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom in 1958. It took until 1995 to get approval in the United States after a potentially fatal disorder linked to a similar drug was found to be rarely if ever associated with metformin.

Unlike insulin shots, which help Type 1 diabetics break down sugar and starches in the blood, metformin lowers blood-sugar levels primarily by squelching the liver’s tendency to release stored-up sugar into the bloodstream. Keeping that extra sugar (actually a form of sugar called glucose) out of the blood helps to maintain normal blood-sugar levels, thereby preventing such long-term complications as blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.

About 29 million people in the United States have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 90 percent of them have Type 2, in which their bodies slowly fail to respond to normal levels of insulin, forcing their pancreas to produce so much that it’s eventually exhausted. The estimated 2.5 million with Type 1, in contrast, lose their ability to produce insulin, usually within a matter of months, due to an autoimmune attack by the body on itself.

Today, the range of ailments being targeted by metformin, a prescription drug sold under such names as Glucophage, Glumetza, Fortamet and Riomet, all share one characteristic: They are diseases related to aging.

“Metformin actually lowers the rate of cell turnover,” said Michael Pollak, who has been studying metformin’s effects on pancreatic cancer as chairman of oncology at McGill University in Montreal. “It makes cells divide less quickly. The rate-of-living theory defines aging as the number of cell divisions you undergo since you were a fertilized egg. If the theory is true, then people who age more gracefully have a slower rate of cell division. The question is whether the rate-of-living theory is operational in mammals.”

Pollak says that none of the most exciting possible benefits for the drug have yet been proved in randomized clinical trials of non-diabetics. For now, the evidence suggesting benefits is limited to large studies of diabetics that have found, on average that those who take metformin tend to have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia, and to live longer overall than those who take other drugs for diabetes. Those effects have also been seen in animal studies. But such evidence often does not pan out in human studies.

At a medical meeting in May, Pollak reported disappointing results from his first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin for people with pancreatic cancer. “It yielded no benefit,” he said. “Plain old metformin given in the same dose as we do for Type 2 diabetes doesn’t seem to be a breakthrough for cancer, at least for pancreatic cancer.”

Many other metformin clinical trials are underway for breast, colorectal, endometrial and other cancers.

For heart disease, the benefit of metformin over most other drugs for Type 2 diabetics has been seen repeatedly in clinical trials. For people without diabetes, only one study has been published, finding no apparent effect after 18 months. As with cancer, however, other studies are underway.

For dementia, which people with Type 2 diabetes have double the risk of developing compared with non-diabetics, metformin has been found in a number of studies to cut that risk substantially.

“There’s been a lot of excitement about metformin and dementia,” said Rachel Whitmer, an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente in California.

In 2013, Whitmer presented the results of a study of about 15,000 people newly prescribed a medication for Type 2 diabetes: By the end of the five-year study, those who received metformin had a 40 percent lower risk of having developed dementia than those prescribed sulfonylureas, another common type of diabetes drug.

But, Whitmer notes, “I don’t think the story is complete. There needs to be more work in this area with all drugs for diabetes.”

For Type 1 diabetes, researchers at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine published a study in May in which they added either a low dose of metformin or placebo pills to the insulin regimen of 74 adolescents. Those who received metformin lost weight — generally a benefit for those with diabetes — and needed less insulin after six months. Those who received the placebo needed more insulin than at the beginning of the study and saw their blood pressure rise. The one goal the study did not achieve was better blood-sugar control.

“There is some benefit, but it wasn’t the full benefit we hoped for,” said Helen Nickerson, senior scientific program manager at JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which partly funded the study. Even so, she said, she is hearing from doctors that growing numbers of them are prescribing metformin along with insulin to patients with Type 1 diabetes.

No one would suggest that a person with Type 1 diabetes stop taking their insulin. Doing so would be life-threatening. For those with Type 1, metformin is being tested only as an add-on to insulin.

JDRF, meanwhile, is funding a clinical trial to see if metformin will reduce the risk of heart disease in people with Type 1, and it is funding a trial in Britain to see if the drug will prevent children from developing Type 1 in the first place.

Terry Wilkin, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Exeter, is leading the prevention trial. He theorizes that the risk of developing Type 1 rises when excess demand for insulin is placed on the pancreas in children who are even slightly overweight. His study will give low daily doses of metformin to children who are at high risk of developing Type 1.

“If we can even slightly lower their average blood sugar with metformin,” Wilkin said, “I believe we can have a big benefit on their risk of developing Type 1.”

Despite all these potential benefits of metformin — and despite a recommendation from the American Diabetes Association that it be tried before any other drug for newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics — a recent study found that only about half of all such people get metformin as their first prescribed medication. The study does not explain why that might be. Among the possibilities, experts say, are that newer drugs are being pushed heavily in direct-to-patient advertising and that some patients are turned off by the common though mild side effect of metformin — stomach upset and diarrhea — which can usually be avoided by starting on a low dose.

The author of the study, Niteesh Choudhry, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, also found that newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetics who start on metformin are the least likely to need an additional diabetes drug later.

“It’s clear that physicians and patients are not always choosing to start on metformin,” he said. “There are legitimate reasons to put patients on one drug rather than another. But the guidelines do recommend metformin first.”

For patients with Type 2 whose doctor started them on a drug other than metformin, he said, “I certainly would encourage people to talk with their doctor. That’s always a good thing.”

story_reviews_00603,"By Andrew M. Seaman

(Reuters Health) - Women who take part in exercise, diet programs or a combination of the two during pregnancy can prevent excessive weight gain, according to a fresh review of past research.

The review incorporates dozens of new studies to update a previous review that did not find enough evidence to support the use of diet and exercise during pregnancy.

After including the new studies, the new review found “high-quality evidence” to show diet, exercise or both can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy, write the researchers in The Cochrane Library.

Other benefits may include a lower risk of cesarean delivery, excessive birth weight, and respiratory

problems in the newborn, “particularly for high-risk women receiving combined diet and exercise interventions,” add the researchers, led by Benja Muktabhant of Khon Kaen University in Thailand.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine says the amount of weight women should gain during pregnancy varies depending on their non-pregnancy weight.

For example, a normal-weight woman should gain between 25 and 35 pounds, while an overweight woman should gain between 15 and 25 pounds. Obese women should gain even less.

Gaining too much weight is tied to an increased risk of complications for both mother and child, according to the researchers, who completed the review for The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research.

For the new review, the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the “gold standard” of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.

The women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.

Women who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.

The women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.

There was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.

While the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it’s good that there was no increase in complications.

“This was very reassuring that there wasn’t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,” said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.

“Most people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,” Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.

She said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born. Then, during the next pregnancy the woman is already heavier and that may increase the risk of complications.

“In the next pregnancy, if you don’t get it off, you may go from obese to very obese,” Thornburg said.

She cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.

story_reviews_00604,"A systematic review of C.B.T. for insomnia, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, quantifies how much relief it can provide. Combining data from 20 clinical trials, which included over 1,000 patients with chronic insomnia, the authors calculated sleep improvements after C.B.T. treatment, relative to no treatment. On average, treated patients fell asleep almost 20 minutes faster and were awake in the night almost half an hour less. The total amount of time that they were sleeping when in bed increased by nearly 10 percent. These results are similar to or better than improvements from many sleep drugs, and lasted longer.

My experience is consistent with these averages. The C.B.T. treatment I received, through an online program recommended by my doctor, also included keeping careful track of how much sleep I got each night. This proved very helpful. It demonstrated progress — the nights in which I got only four or five hours of sleep became less common, and, on average, my nights of sleep lengthened by 30 minutes. My sleep log also helped me be more objective. Many nights I might have considered “bad” — and fretted over — were ones in which I got only one hour less sleep than my target of seven hours. Recognizing that’s not really so bad helped me relax, and relaxing helped me get more and better sleep.

Improvements like mine and those reported in the study bring sleep statistics for those with insomnia quite close to those without it. This further emphasizes the point that many insomniacs aren’t that different from normal sleepers. Many sleep fine most nights, but also have more frequent nights of insufficient sleep than normal sleepers would experience. A big part of the difference may be how insomniacs perceive their sleep performance and the negative messages they give themselves about their poor sleep and how it will affect their daily lives.

C.B.T. practitioners learn that if you label a night of sleep “bad” and expect a bad day to follow a bad night of sleep, you’re more likely to get it, as well as more likely to be anxious the next time you attempt to sleep. In this way, unless exacerbated by physical causes — like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome — insomnia is a condition of the mind that then infects the body. Like a patch on faulty software, C.B.T. reorients one’s thinking and behavior so that sleep is first thought to be, and then soon after actually is, a more positive experience. Drugs, on the other hand, just treat insomniacs’ symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, which is why the relief they provide may be less durable.

For me, and many patients, C.B.T. works. And as studies show, it works better than drugs. That moment with my children, a couple of years ago, was the last time I fell asleep reading to them.",The Evidence Points to a Better Way to Fight Insomnia,4,New York Times

Merck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company’s share price.

Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin that helps lower blood sugar levels, had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet

On the study’s main focus, after about three years 11.4 percent of Januvia patients had experienced cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina versus 11.6 percent in the placebo group.

The detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“We can be reassured we can use this drug for glucose lowering without affecting the already high cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes,” said Professor Rury Holman, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Boston.

“For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added.

There was also no significant difference between Januvia and placebo in infections, cancer, kidney failure or severe hypoglycemia, which is dangerously low blood sugar, researchers reported.

Acute pancreatitis, a concern with some diabetes drugs, was uncommon but higher with Januvia, 23 versus 12. That was not statistically significant.

“Numerically this is hardly a major risk, just something we need to keep an eye on,” Holman said.

Pancreatic cancers, also uncommon, were numerically fewer with Januvia, 9 versus 14.

Death from any cause occurred in 7.5 percent of Januvia patients versus 7.3 percent for placebo.

story_reviews_00606,"When Stephen Weber saw an ad seeking participants to help determine whether online games could improve brain function, it was, well, a no-brainer. The Drexel senior would get paid for what sounded to him like playing Nintendo. Maybe it could even help him remedy his weakness in math, he thought. So he signed up for a University of Pennsylvania study on ""the effects of Lumosity on brain activity and decision-making behavior."" There's much more at stake here than the fortunes of an industry whose revenue is expected to hit $6 billion a year by 2020. Or whether Weber can do math more easily in his head than using a calculator.

Studies on brain games have offered mixed results. Some are promising, but others indicate the games offer little more than recreation.

""There's some evidence that brain games can improve cognitive functions,"" says Caryn Lerman, professor of psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine and deputy director of Penn's Abramson Cancer Center.

But the more important question, she says, is ""can we change the brain to change behavior?""

Lerman is one of two principal investigators in the $2 million study, financed by the National Cancer Institute. She and her coinvestigator, assistant psychology professor Joseph Kable, say the institute wants to see whether brain circuits that are active when we display restraint can be stimulated by brain games.

In other words, could brain games help with healthy behaviors such as proper diet and avoiding smoking - which explains the institute's interest.

The trial involves 200 adults ages 18 to 35, the range when adopting healthy behaviors does the most good. All are given a functional brain MRI to test areas such as working memory, sustained inhibition, and response inhibition.

Half the subjects are then asked to play Lumosity, a popular brain game, five times a week for 30 minutes. The other are given free video games not designed to stimulate the brain. A second brain MRI then follows.

""Our theory,"" Lerman says, ""is that if you activate these higher brain networks that are involved in executive control, the brain will assert more top-down control over lower regions of the brain that drive people to these gratifying behaviors like [unhealthy] eating and smoking.""

Answers are expected in a year or less.

""Based on extensive research,"" Lumosity's website states, the game ""improves memory, attention, processing speed, and problem-solving skills so you can feel more confident in your abilities.""

A consensus statement last year by 70 cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists found such claims highly questionable.

The group, assembled by the Stanford Center on Longevity and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, stated: ""Claims promoting brain games are frequently exaggerated and at times misleading.""

Practice a specific skill enough, and you will get better at it, the group said. But that doesn't mean ""general and lasting improvements of mind and brain.""

A Lumosity official asked that questions be submitted by e-mail but then declined to respond to a request for independent studies supporting the company's claims.

Arthur F. Kramer, director of the Beckman Institute for Science and Technology at the University of Illinois, was a signer of the consensus statement. He says that after decades of studies, there is no evidence brief interventions like brain games translate into lasting effects in the real world.

What does work, he says, is physical exercise such as running and walking.

Jason Chein, principal investigator at the Neurocognition Lab at Temple University, is more optimistic. A study using two groups of 20 Temple students in 2007-10 found memory training on a computerized program designed by the lab not only made the students better at playing the game, but also appeared to enhance discipline and reading comprehension.

Had he been asked, Chein said, he would not have signed the consensus statement. ""It's too negative, and I'm not sure it really reflects the scientific consensus.""

Still, if computerized brain games are proved to work, he said, ""you'd have to figure out why, for whom, and under what circumstances. There's favorable evidence, but we have a lot of investigation to do.""

Joseph Santos, a Drexel University sophomore in Lerman's study, says since playing Lumosity, he feels ""my memory is improving. I remember things I used to forget. I've been doing somewhat better on exams. . . . My reactions are a little bit faster.""

Researchers say it's common for test subjects to perceive improvements even if they aren't measurable. Weber, the Drexel senior in the study, wasn't sure whether the brain games had made him any sharper.

But neither Weber nor Santos will know for sure because research subjects generally don't get their individual results.

Dawn Mechanic-Hamilton, clinical director of the Cognitive Fitness Program at the University of Pennsylvania, says she has used a commercial brain game, Brain HQ, in her work with adults with mild cognitive impairment and has found it helpful in combination with classwork and individual coaching. But she doesn't see it as a magic bullet.

""If you're going to spend time doing other things that are cognitively challenging,"" she says, such as taking music lessons or learning a language, ""then you shouldn't replace it with a computerized program.""

On the other hand, she said, brain games are likely better for you than a few hours of TV watching - but even that's not clear.

""We just don't know a lot of stuff we need to,"" she said.

An April report from the Institute of Medicine puts brain games fairly low on the ladder of recommended ways to improve cognition or maintain abilities.

Kramer says the entire field is far too complex for any one definitive trial. Walter R. Boot, an assistant professor of psychology at Florida State University, estimates it may be a decade before psychologists can know for sure whether brain games can be effective and, if so, in what ways and for which populations.

Lerman hopes to bring the final answer a bit closer, partly through using MRI scans to measure brain function before and after the subjects have played Lumosity or standard video games.

""We know what parts of the brain and what circuits light up when people are doing these exercises,"" Lerman says.

""What we haven't tested is whether a program of 10 weeks changes the brain in a way that's sustainable and helps people change their behaviors.""

RX FOR YOUR BRAIN

According to the Institute of Medicine, the jury is still out on whether brain games improve cognitive health for people trying to stave off normal age-related declines.

In a recent report, ""Cognitive Aging: Progress in Understanding and Opportunities for Action,"" the institute analyzed the best available evidence and came up with this prescription for

Editor's note, June 10: We have added an acknowledgement of several sources that Esther Gokhale used while developing her theories on back pain. These include physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method, and the work of anthropologist Noelle Perez-Christiaens.

Back pain is a tricky beast. Most Americans will at some point have a problem with their backs. And for an unlucky third, treatments won't work, and the problem will become chronic.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Esther Gokhale/Gerard Mackworth-Young Courtesy of Esther Gokhale/Gerard Mackworth-Young

Believe it or not, there are a few cultures in the world where back pain hardly exists. One indigenous tribe in central India reported essentially none. And the discs in their backs showed little signs of degeneration as people aged.

An acupuncturist in Palo Alto, Calif., thinks she has figured out why. She has traveled around the world studying cultures with low rates of back pain — how they stand, sit and walk. Now she's sharing their secrets with back pain sufferers across the U.S.

About two decades ago, Esther Gokhale started to struggle with her own back after she had her first child. ""I had excruciating pain. I couldn't sleep at night,"" she says. ""I was walking around the block every two hours. I was just crippled.""

Gokhale had a herniated disc. Eventually she had surgery to fix it. But a year later, it happened again. ""They wanted to do another back surgery. You don't want to make a habit out of back surgery,"" she says.

This time around, Gokhale wanted to find a permanent fix for her back. And she wasn't convinced Western medicine could do that. So Gokhale started to think outside the box. She had an idea: ""Go to populations where they don't have these huge problems and see what they're doing.""

Esther Gokhale's Five Tips For Better Posture And Less Back Pain Try these exercises while you're working at your desk, sitting at the dinner table or walking around, Esther Gokhale recommends. 1. Do a shoulder roll: Americans tend to scrunch their shoulders forward, so our arms are in front of our bodies. That's not how people in indigenous cultures carry their arms, Gokhale says. To fix that, gently pull your shoulders up, push them back and then let them drop — like a shoulder roll. Now your arms should dangle by your side, with your thumbs pointing out. ""This is the way all your ancestors parked their shoulders,"" she says. ""This is the natural architecture for our species."" 2. Lengthen your spine: Adding extra length to your spine is easy, Gokhale says. Being careful not to arch your back, take a deep breath in and grow tall. Then maintain that height as you exhale. Repeat: Breathe in, grow even taller and maintain that new height as you exhale. ""It takes some effort, but it really strengthens your abdominal muscles,"" Gokhale says. 3. Squeeze, squeeze your glute muscles when you walk: In many indigenous cultures, people squeeze their gluteus medius muscles every time they take a step. That's one reason they have such shapely buttocks muscles that support their lower backs. Gokhale says you can start developing the same type of derrière by tightening the buttocks muscles when you take each step. ""The gluteus medius is the one you're after here. It's the one high up on your bum,"" Gokhale says. ""It's the muscle that keeps you perky, at any age."" 4. Don't put your chin up: Instead, add length to your neck by taking a lightweight object, like a bean bag or folded washcloth, and balance it on the top of your crown. Try to push your head against the object. ""This will lengthen the back of your neck and allow your chin to angle down — not in an exaggerated way, but in a relaxed manner,"" Gokhale says. 5. Don't sit up straight! ""That's just arching your back and getting you into all sorts of trouble,"" Gokhale says. Instead do a shoulder roll to open up the chest and take a deep breath to stretch and lengthen the spine.

[Added June 10] So Gokhale studied findings from anthropologists, such as Noelle Perez-Christiaens, who analyzed postures of indigenous populations. And she studied physiotherapy methods, such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method.

And the original post continues ...

Then over the next decade, Gokhale went to cultures around the world that live far away from modern life. She went to the mountains in Ecuador, tiny fishing towns in Portugal and remote villages of West Africa.

""I went to villages where every kid under age 4 was crying because they were frightened to see somebody with white skin — they'd never seen a white person before,"" she says.

Gokhale took photos and videos of people who walked with water buckets on their heads, collected firewood or sat on the ground weaving, for hours.

""I have a picture in my book of these two women who spend seven to nine hours everyday, bent over, gathering water chestnuts,"" Gokhale says. ""They're quite old. But the truth is they don't have a back pain.""

She tried to figure out what all these different people had in common. The first thing that popped out was the shape of their spines. ""They have this regal posture, and it's very compelling.""

And it's quite different than American spines.

If you look at an American's spine from the side, or profile, it's shaped like the letter S. It curves at the top and then back again at the bottom.

But Gokhale didn't see those two big curves in people who don't have back pain. ""That S shape is actually not natural,"" she says. ""It's a J-shaped spine that you want.""

In fact, if you look at drawings from Leonardo da Vinci — or a Gray's Anatomy book from 1901 — the spine isn't shaped like a sharp, curvy S. It's much flatter, all the way down the back. Then at the bottom, it curves to stick the buttocks out. So the spine looks more like the letter J.

""The J-shaped spine is what you see in Greek statues. It's what you see in young children. It's good design,"" Gokhale says.

So Gokhale worked to get her spine into the J shape. And gradually her back pain went away.

Then Gokhale realized she could help others. She developed a set of exercises, wrote a book and set up a studio in downtown Palo Alto.

Now her list of clients is impressive. She's helped YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report. She has given classes at Google, Facebook and companies across the country. In Silicon Valley, she's known as the ""posture guru.""

Each year, doctors in the Bay Area refer hundreds of patients to Gokhale. One of them is Dr. Neeta Jain, an internist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. She puts Gokhale's method in the same category as Pilates and yoga for back pain. And it doesn't bother her that the method hasn't been tested in a clinical trial.

""If people are finding things that are helpful, and it's not causing any harm, then why do we have to wait for a trial?"" Jain asked.

But there's still a big question looming here: Is Gokhale right? Have people in Western cultures somehow forgotten the right way to stand?

Scientists don't know yet, says Dr. Praveen Mummaneni, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco's Spine Center. Nobody has done a study on traditional cultures to see why some have lower rates of back pain, he says. Nobody has even documented the shape of their spines.

""I'd like to go and take X-rays of indigenous populations and compare it to people in the Western world,"" Mummaneni says. ""I think that would be helpful.""

But there's a whole bunch of reasons why Americans' postures — and the shape of their spines — may be different than those of indigenous populations, he says. For starters, Americans tend to be much heavier.

""If you have a lot of fat built up in the belly, that could pull your weight forward,"" Mummaneni says. ""That could curve the spine. And people who are thinner probably have less curvature"" — and thus a spine shaped more like J than than an S.

Americans are also much less active than people in traditional cultures, Mummaneni says. ""I think the sedentary lifestyle promotes a lack of muscle tone and a lack of postural stability because the muscles get weak.""

toggle caption NPR

Everyone knows that weak abdominal muscles can cause back pain. In fact, Mummaneni says, stronger muscles might be the secret to Gokhale's success.

In other words, it's not that the J-shaped spine is the ideal one — or the healthiest. It's what goes into making the J-shaped spine that matters: ""You have to use muscle strength to get your spine to look like a J shape,"" he says.

So Gokhale has somehow figured out a way to teach people to build up their core muscles without them even knowing it. ""Yes, I think that's correct,"" Mummaneni says. ""You're not going to be able to go from the S- to the J-shaped spine without having good core muscle strength. And I think that's key here.""

The FDA advisory pointed to a single study showing a six-fold increased risk of a condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns whose mothers were taking antidepressants.

But now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston's Dr. Mallika Marshall.

Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston looked at 3.8 million pregnant women nationwide and found that those taking popular antidepressants, called SSRIs, did not appear to be at significantly increased risk of having a baby with pulmonary hypertension.

""The risk increase of taking antidepressants late in pregnancy, if present, is much more modest than previous studies have found,"" says Krista Huybrechts, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information.""

It's certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants.

""They take them because they have a disease that impacts their daily life,"" Economy says. ""And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves. So for many of these women, these medications are life-saving and life-altering.""

Dr. Economy warns patients about the potential risks like withdrawal in the newborn and a small risk of heart defects, but says for many women, the worst time to stop their medications is at the end of pregnancy when postpartum depression becomes a concern.

""My basic message is that, overall, there may be some slight risks associated with the medication, but in balancing risks and benefits for most women, I would suggest they stay on their medication,"" she said.","Antidepressants in pregnancy pose little risk to babies, study finds",3,CBS News

story_reviews_00610,"CHICAGO—Using whole-brain radiation to treat cancer that has spread to the brain is a treatment that for many patients is worse than the disease, a new study suggests.

Researchers said the technique, when used after a more precise radiotherapy to kill the cancer, resulted in more memory loss and other cognitive deficits than treating with radiotherapy alone. While the more aggressive treatment was better at preventing recurrence of tumors in the brain, it didn’t extend survival.

“The potential benefits of whole brain radiation therapy are far outweighed by the detriments of the therapy itself,” said Paul Brown, professor of radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. The “negative impact” on cognitive function “was more than I would have expected.”

Dr. Brown is lead author of the study which was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study involved 213 patients who had one to three small tumors, or metastases in the brain. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Brain metastases is a common problem in cancer affecting an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients annually in the U.S. alone, some 200,000 of whom get whole brain radiation during the course of their disease. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy to spread to the brain, followed by breast cancer and melanoma.

Whole brain radiation was first used in 1954 and has long been a standard strategy for brain metastases, said Andrew Lassman, chief of neuro-oncology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Though doctors have curbed its use in recent years amid concerns over its deleterious effect on cognitive function, whether the treatment or recurrence of metastases is worse for the patient has remained controversial, he said.

Whole brain radiation is typically administered in 10 20-minute treatments given over two weeks while radiosurgery, in which radiation is delivered in a powerful, focused beam with instruments known by such names as the gammaknife, is a longer procedure given in a single day.

For the study, patients were randomly assigned to either radiosurgery followed by whole brain radiation or radiosurgery alone. Patients then underwent seven cognitive tests three months after treatment and at several subsequent intervals.

Patients treated with both approaches performed significantly worse three months later on tests involving immediate recall of words, delayed recall and measures of verbal communication. Patients given both treatments also scored lower on a quality of life questionnaire, Dr. Brown said. Median overall survival was 7.5 months for those receiving both treatments and 10.7 months for those on radiosurgery alone, a result considered statistically about the same.

The study will “push the use of whole-brain radiation therapy more toward the latter portion of the patient’s course, when they have no more good viable options,” Dr. Brown said.

The new report is “the most comprehensive study that lets us quantify the risk/benefit” of the treatment, said Brian M. Alexander, a radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.

Dr Lassman said the findings conflict with some other studies. He said patients for whom brain metastases rather than their primary cancer pose the biggest threat to survival, for instance, may benefit from whole-brain radiation.

Dr. Lassman added that both whole brain radiation and recurrent metastases are “bad for the brain.”

He said researchers are studying alternate approaches, including irradiating the brain while shielding the hippocampus, a component of the brain critical to memory, and giving certain drugs used to treat dementia that may protect the brain against the effects of radiation.

Patients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in all) lived an average of 41 months. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, where agents are used to boost a body's natural defense against a tumor, are already the best treatments against melanoma. But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment.

Using a virus as a drug isn't a new idea. Phage therapy, where viruses that attack certain bacteria are used in place of antibiotics, is commonly used in Europe and on the rise in the United States. But cancer therapies like the one described in the new paper take things a step further, manipulating existing viruses to turn them into cancer-fighting tools.

AD

AD

Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research and head of the trial, has been working on this particular virus for about a decade. Before he signed onto the project, it was primarily being investigated as a breast cancer treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all.

Here's how T-VEC works: It starts with the herpes virus, which is magnificent at proliferating itself within cells and then causing them to burst (that's where the cold sores come from). But T-VEC has had two key genes removed. These keep it from replicating within healthy cells, which can quickly spot it because of the missing genes.

But cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. Meanwhile, T-VEC has also been modified to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which serves as a red flag waved at the immune system.

AD

AD

So in addition to the destructive power of the T-VEC cells themselves, the therapy summons the immune system right to where it's needed -- the tumor.

""This is a first in class agent, a brand new therapy,"" Harrington said. ""But it's just the farthest along of what we hope will be many more.""

Harrington expects the FDA to clear T-VEC within the year, and it could potentially be available to patients right away.

But there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC. Now that other therapies -- ones that target specific mutations in patients' cancer cells -- are showing more success than what was available when the trial was formed, researchers will have to see how T-VEC compares.

AD

AD

""The next steps are exciting, and already underway,"" he said. ""The next big frontier will be to combine this with existing immunotherapies. There's a strong rationale that other drugs on the market could act synogistically with ours.""

Trials are also underway to determine how T-VEC might do with other cancers. In the meantime, other researchers will continue to crack the codes of other viruses to make them do our bidding.

story_reviews_00613,"Delayed Umbilical Cord Clamping May Benefit Children Years Later

A couple of extra minutes attached to the umbilical cord at birth may translate into a small boost in neurodevelopment several years later, a study suggests.

Children whose cords were cut more than three minutes after birth had slightly higher social skills and fine motor skills than those whose cords were cut within 10 seconds. The results showed no differences in IQ.

""There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth,"" said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Rabe's editorial accompanied the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

Delaying the clamping of the cord allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, sometimes increasing the infant's blood volume by up to a third. The iron in the blood increases infants' iron storage, and iron is essential for healthy brain development.

""The extra blood at birth helps the baby to cope better with the transition from life in the womb, where everything is provided for them by the placenta and the mother, to the outside world,"" Rabe said. ""Their lungs get more blood so that the exchange of oxygen into the blood can take place smoothly.""

Past studies have shown higher levels of iron and other positive effects later in infancy among babies whose cords were clamped after several minutes, but few studies have looked at results past infancy.

In this study, researchers randomly assigned half of 263 healthy Swedish full-term newborns to have their cords clamped more than three minutes after birth. The other half were clamped less than 10 seconds after birth.

Four years later, the children underwent a series of assessments for IQ, motor skills, social skills, problem-solving, communication skills and behavior. Those with delayed cord clamping showed modestly higher scores in social skills and fine motor skills. When separated by sex, only the boys showed statistically significant improvement.

""We don't know exactly why, but speculate that girls receive extra protection through higher estrogen levels whilst being in the womb,"" Rabe said. ""The results in term infants are consistent with those of follow-up in preterm infants.""

Delayed cord clamping has garnered more attention in the past few years for its potential benefits to the newborn. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out.

Much of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. Preemies who have delayed cord clamping tend to have better blood pressure in the days immediately after birth, need fewer drugs to support blood pressure, need fewer blood transfusions, have less bleeding into the brain and have a lower risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel injury, she said.

This study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not yet endorsed the practice, citing insufficient evidence for full-term infants. The World Health Organization recommends delayed cord clamping of not less than one minute.

It is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. Some studies have found a higher risk of jaundice, a buildup of bilirubin in the blood from the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is treated with blue light therapy and rarely has serious complications.

Another potential risk is a condition called polycythemia, a very high red blood cell count, said Dr. Scott Lorch, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Perinatal and Pediatric Health Disparities Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

""Polycythemia can have medical consequences for the infant, including blood clots, respiratory distress and even strokes in the worst-case scenario,"" Lorch said. Some studies have found higher levels of red blood cells in babies with delayed cord clamping, but there were no complications.

Lorch also pointed out that this study involved a mostly homogenous population in a country outside the U.S.

""We should see whether similar effects are seen in higher-risk populations, such as the low socioeconomic population, racial and ethnic minorities and those at higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay,"" Lorch said.

So far, studies on delayed cord clamping have excluded infants born in distress, such as those with breathing difficulties or other problems. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.

These babies often need more blood volume to help with blood pressure, breathing and circulation problems, Rabe said. ""Also, the placental blood is rich with stem cells, which could help to repair any brain damage the baby might have suffered during a difficult birth,"" she added. ""Milking of the cord would be the easiest way to get the extra blood into the baby quickly in an emergency situation.""",Delayed Umbilical Cord Clamping May Benefit Children Years Later,4,NPR

Special for USA TODAY

Cutting the cord is a momentous event in a baby's life.

For nine months, the developing fetus is attached to its mother by the umbilical cord. Then, moments after birth, that cord is severed.

Now, research suggests there may be benefits to keeping mom and baby attached a few minutes longer.

Those benefits, researchers say, likely have to do with iron.

Waiting a few minutes before clamping the umbilical cord allows more iron-rich blood from the placenta to reach the newborn.

Iron deficiency occurs in about one in six American babies, and it's more common among those clamped quickly, said Ola Andersson, a neonatologist and pediatrician at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led a study published today in JAMA Pediatrics. Babies who are anemic often appear tired and pale.

His previous research has shown that babies whose cords were clamped a few minutes later than usual were 90% less likely than others to have iron-deficiency anemia when they were 4 months old.

The benefits of those extra few minutes may last a long time.

In the new study, Andersson found that healthy, full-term newborns whose umbilical cords were left attached for three extra minutes had better fine motor control when they reached preschool than those clamped immediately. Some 4-year-old boys who were clamped later even appeared to have better social skills.

Iron is essential to the developing brain, he said, and deficiencies during early months — perhaps linked to early clamping — could affect nerve and muscle control, making it harder for the child to later control a pen or interact comfortably with peers.

Andersson's study marks the first time researchers have followed children to see whether the clamping makes a difference later in life. In 2011, he published a study of 400 healthy, full-term babies showing that those clamped later fared better; the new study of 263 of those children extends those findings by nearly four years.

Boys showed more benefit than girls, probably because they are more likely to be iron-deficient, Andersson said.

Immediate clamping started about 70 years ago out of concern that leaving the delivered infant attached to the placenta could rob the mother of too much blood.

But those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.

For babies born at full-term, ""we should trust nature more than we do now,"" she said.

Rabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies.

Many countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible. There was not enough evidence before to extend that recommendation to full-term babies, but Rabe thinks this study should tip the balance in favor of delay.

Kjersti Aagaard, vice chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, is more skeptical. She said the decision about when to clamp should be made between the doctor and parents, depending on the delivery, the health of the baby and the mother's condition.

""The most important thing for parents to be talking with their provider about is how will we adapt to the delivery as it emerges,"" she said.",,4,premature babies

MONDAY, May 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Too few women at high risk for osteoporosis are being tested for the bone-depleting condition, while too many women at low-risk are being screened, a new study suggests.

A team led by Dr. Anna Lee Amarnath of the University of California, Davis, examined the medical records of nearly 51,000 women, aged 40 to 85, living in the Sacramento area.

The researchers looked at whether or not women were getting a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test, which measures bone mineral density.

The result: Osteoporosis screening rates jumped sharply at age 50, despite guidelines suggesting that screening only begin at age 65, unless a woman has certain risk factors.

However, the study also found that those risk factors -- a small body frame, a history of fractures, or taking medications that could thin bones -- had only a slight effect on a woman's decision to get her bones tested.

Over seven years, more than 42 percent of eligible women aged 65 to 74 were not screened, Amarath's team found, nor were nearly 57 percent of those older than 75.

However, nearly 46 percent of low-risk women aged 50 to 59 were screened, as were 59 percent of low-risk women aged 60 to 64.

The study was published online May 19 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

""DXA screening was underused in women at increased fracture risk, including women aged 65 years and older. Meanwhile, it was common among women at low fracture risk, such as younger women without osteoporosis risk factors,"" Amarnath said in a journal news release.

What to do? Reminder notes to doctors and patients might help, one expert said.

""Health systems should invest in developing electronic health records systems that prompt providers at the point-of-care when screening is needed and when it can be postponed,"" study senior author Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at UC Davis, said in the news release.

story_reviews_00616,"The largest analysis to date of amyloid plaques in people’s brains confirms that the presence of the substance can help predict who will develop Alzheimer’s and determine who has the disease.

Two linked studies, published Tuesday in JAMA, also support the central early role in Alzheimer’s of beta amyloid, the protein that creates plaques. Data from nearly 9,500 people on five continents shows that amyloid can appear 20 to 30 years before symptoms of dementia, that the vast majority of Alzheimer’s patients have amyloid and that the ApoE4 gene, known to increase Alzheimer’s risk, greatly accelerates amyloid accumulation.

The findings also confirm that amyloid screening, by PET scan or cerebral spinal fluid test, can help identify people for clinical trials of drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s. Such screening is increasingly used in research. Experts say previous trials of anti-amyloid drugs on people with dementia failed because their brains were already too damaged or because some patients, not screened for amyloid, may not have had Alzheimer’s.

“The papers indicate that amyloid imaging is important to be sure that the drugs are being tested on people who have amyloid,” said Dr. Roger Rosenberg, the director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, who wrote an editorial about the studies.",Studies Confirm Brain Plaque Can Help Predict Alzheimer’s,3,Alzheimer's
story_reviews_00617,"An estimated 25 million to 45 million Americans suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, a gastrointestinal condition that can cause miserable symptoms. Making it worse for many patients, there hasn't been a conclusive test to diagnose what's wrong with them. Without proof of a physical cause, some doctors considered IBS a psychological disorder.

But that could finally change with the introduction of two simple new blood tests for spotting the disease. Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.

""We now have a test to say, you have a disease,"" Pimentel told CBS News. ""Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.""

New tests for common gastrointestinal disorder

The tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning. Researchers believe the toxin triggers the immune system to attack a person's intestinal tract long after the toxin is gone.

Irina Obenauer was diagnosed with IBS years ago after suffering from diarrhea and bloating, but it took doctors a long time to rule out other possible diagnoses first.

""There's always kind of a 'trend of the week' that you had to go and get tested for and rule out, and at the end of the day you don't feel better,"" she said.

She got the new blood test to confirm her diagnosis, and when it came back positive, she said she felt a sense of relief knowing IBS wasn't all in her head.

""I'm not saying the symptoms went away,"" she said, but she ""started to feel more whole.""

CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is also a practicing internist and gastroenterologist, points out that the test is not perfect. While a positive test result is highly suggestive of IBS, only 44 percent of patients with IBS tested positive, meaning that many people who test negative could in fact still have the condition.",New tests offer hope for millions of patients with irritable bowel syndrome,1,CBS News
story_reviews_00618,"The first procedure carries a 15 percent risk of collapsing a lung (pneumothorax), as well as infection. The second is serious surgery that requires general anesthesia and results in the loss of lung tissue. Both are in-patient procedures that carry the cost and other risks of hospitalizations. In about a third of the surgeries, the growth turns out to be benign, meaning the surgery was unnecessary.

But now, according to a study published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, there appears to be a new, much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant. Researchers at Boston University have discovered that the thin epithelial cells that line the entire airway show changes that indicate whether a growth is malignant. With small brushes on the bronchoscope, they can take some of those cells and, using genomic testing that has been available only in recent years, reach a conclusion.

The study released Sunday showed that the tests were about 97 percent accurate on 639 subjects. A private company has purchased the technology and is making it available to hospitals across the country.

""Even though lung cancer tends to develop deep in your lung, all the cells that line your airway are exposed,"" said Avrum Spira, a professor of medicine at Boston University who led the research. ""They have changes in their genome.""

Spira's test focuses on messenger RNA, the molecules that express genes' instructions to cells. He called the technology ""a canary in the coal mine"" for lung cancer, which kills about 160,000 people in the United States each year.

AD

If the test is negative, its accuracy will allow doctors to wait and watch a lesion. If it shows a malignancy, a biopsy still would be needed to confirm the cancer. ""There will still be a small number of biopsies,"" Spira said. ""But we're going to reduce them significantly.""

AD

Other research is being conducted to find markers for lung cancer, though much of it focuses on substances that can be found in the blood, Spira said. With the vast majority of lung cancer victims being smokers, the epithelial cells show changes that could be tracked once the technology became available, he said.

The next logical question is whether those changes might be detected early enough to predict and prevent lung cancer. Spira said his team already is working on research to determine whether that's possible.

AD

The current advance was a long time in coming and shows the difficulty of bringing research from the lab to the consumer. Spira said the initial discovery was made 12 years ago, but he couldn't find any private group willing to put up the millions of dollars needed to conduct studies, work through the government and academic regulatory process and bring his idea to market.

Seven years ago, he formed his own company, raised venture capital and eventually proved that his idea worked. Now his company has been purchased by Veracyte, which will take over the production and marketing of the ""Bronchial Genomic Classifier.""

story_reviews_00619,"A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month.

Researchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who've had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.)

For the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.

""That's a dramatic number,"" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""It could make a major impact.""

Vitamin B3 could help skin cancer patients

Dr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. ""If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,"" she told CBS News.

How does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- ""turns back on the immune system,"" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage.

Nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.

The two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.

One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she's had ""quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,"" even though she tries to stay out of the sun. Wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy, which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life.

Wiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising. ""I am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best,"" she said.

Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. ""It's safe, it's almost obscenely inexpensive, and it's already widely commercially available,"" Dr. Diona Damian, the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the University of Sydney, told HealthDay.

But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it. ""It's not something we'd recommend at this stage for the general population,"" Damian said. She also noted that the benefits appear to wear off when patients stop taking the supplements.

Results of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this month.",Vitamin B3 could help reduce skin cancer risk,3,Cancer
story_reviews_00620,"For the first time, a large study suggests that a vitamin might modestly lower the risk of the most common types of skin cancer in people with a history of these relatively harmless yet troublesome growths.

In a study in Australia, people who took a specific type of vitamin B3 for a year had a 23 percent lower rate of new skin cancers compared to others who took dummy pills. In absolute terms, it meant that vitamin takers developed fewer than two of these cancers on average versus roughly 2.5 cancers for the others.

The study did not involve melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. Instead, it aimed at more common forms — basal and squamous cell cancers. More than 3 million cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.

""These are sort of the run-of-the-mill skin cancers that so many people get,"" said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, an organization of cancer specialists. ""They're rarely lethal but they're very persistent and they keep coming back,"" and are expensive to remove, usually through surgery, freezing off the spots or radiation.

He and other doctors with the oncology group said the vitamin, called nicotinamide, could offer a cheap, easy way to lower risk.

However, Australia has higher rates of skin cancer than the U.S. and other parts of the world, and some doctors may want more evidence beyond this single study before recommending the pills. Vitamins have long proved elusive for cancer prevention, and some studies have even found certain ones can be harmful.

Researchers also stressed they were not suggesting vitamin use for people who have not yet had one of these cancers.

""At the moment, it's not something for the general population,"" said the study's leader, Dr. Diona Damian of the Dermatology University of Sydney in Australia.

""We must always remember the basics of sun-sensible behaviors"" — avoiding overexposure and using sunscreen — as the best ways for anyone to lower risk, she said.

The study involved 386 people who had at least two skin cancers in the previous five years. They took either 500 milligrams of the vitamin or dummy pills twice a day for a year. Neither they nor their doctors knew who got what until the study ended.

Besides reducing the rate of skin cancers, vitamin use also seemed to cut the rate of precancers — scaly patches of skin called actinic keratoses — by 11 percent after three months of use and 20 percent after nine months.

Participants were tracked for six months after they stopped taking their pills, and the rate of new skin cancers was similar in both groups.

""The benefit wears off fairly quickly,"" Damian said. ""You need to continue taking the tablets for them to continue to be effective.""

Nicotinamide (nih-kuh-TEE'-nuh-myd) is thought to help repair DNA in cells damaged by sun exposure. It is not the same as nicotine, the addictive stuff in tobacco. It's also not the same as niacin and some other forms of B3, which can cause flushing, headaches and blood pressure problems. Those problems were not seen with nicotinamide in the study.

Nicotinamide is sold over the counter, is easy to take, and ""there are essentially no side effects,"" Schilsky said.",Study: Vitamin B3 May Help Prevent Certain Skin Cancers,5,Associated Press
story_reviews_00621,"The Mediterranean diet, supplemented with a handful of nuts or a few tablespoons of olive oil a day, can counteract the effects of aging on the brain’s ability to function, a new clinical study suggests.

The study, published online Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, was unusual in that it employed rigorous scientific practices to test the effect of the diet on health. Most previous evidence showing benefits from the Mediterranean diet was gathered through observational studies, a less conclusive research technique.

“This was the first clinical, randomized study using a dietary pattern for good health,” said Emilio Ros, who led the study at Hospital Clinic, part of the University of Barcelona in Spain. Data gathered from previous observational studies suggested that adhering to a Mediterranean-type diet related to better cognitive function and a reduced risk of dementia, but observational studies have limitations, he said. “This clinical trial removes the bias and provides first-level evidence,” said Dr. Ros, director of the lipid clinic at Hospital Clinic’s endocrinology department.

The Mediterranean diet, which has also shown benefits in cardiovascular health, emphasizes vegetables and fruits, unrefined grains and beans. It also includes fish and wine and minimal consumption of meat and full-fat dairy products.

The study involved 447 cognitively healthy participants, 55 to 80 years of age, who were divided into three groups. Two groups followed the Mediterranean diet and added either 30 grams of mixed nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds) a day, or five tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil a day. The third group, acting as a control, was advised to follow a low-fat diet. The subjects were followed for a median of just over four years.

The results showed that, compared with the control group, memory function remained stronger in the Mediterranean diet plus nuts group, while frontal (attention and executive function) and global cognition benefited in the Mediterranean diet plus olive oil group.

The diminished decline in cognitive function likely stems from the abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents found in the supplemental foods, Dr. Ros said. Olive oil and nuts are rich in phenolic compounds that might counteract oxidative processes in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration, the study said. “If you can delay your age-related cognitive decline, you can process tasks with higher speed,” said Dr. Ros.

Jane Cerhan, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who wasn’t involved in the research, said clinical studies of age-related cognitive decline are needed in regard to diet, “which is why this study is an extra good one, because of its size and randomized design.” However, she said: “The changes observed in cognition were very small and didn’t actually show that those diets improved cognition, they just showed less decline.” Based on the research, she said, people shouldn’t rush out to buy lots of olive oil and nut, but she encourages they follow a balanced diet that includes healthy foods such as these.

The research was a substudy of a larger investigation, designed by Dr. Ros, that found the Mediterranean diet, supplemented with additional olive oil or nuts, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events among people at high cardiovascular risk. That study, which involved nearly 7,500 participants and known by the acronym Predimed, was published in 2013.

In the latest study, Dr. Ros said participants were given 1 liter of olive oil per week, but that amount was intended for their entire household. He recommends that, to decrease age-related cognitive delay, people should add 5 tablespoons of olive oil as well as a handful of nuts per day into their diet.

“I like walnuts, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids,” he said. In general, he would like to see everyone improve their diets “by eating more fish, less meat, and improving your legume intake.” He also suggested adding the Spanish “sofrito” sauce of slowly simmering tomatoes, onions, and garlic in olive oil to dress rice and pasta dishes in weekly menus. “We believe this is an antioxidant cocktail.”

The study was funded by the Spanish government. Dr. Ros has previously received research funding from the California Walnut Commission and is a nonpaid member of the group’s scientific advisory committee, the study said.","Mediterranean Diet Boosts Brain Power, Clinical Study Finds",4,Diet studies

Terri Bradford has suffered debilitating headaches all her life. Some days the pain is so bad, she says, ""By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.""

""I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.""

Over the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. ""Everything I've had, I've had twice,"" she says. ""I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.""

Bradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.

People who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

Mafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.

Mafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.

""There's a subconscious perception that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.""

""Patients are more assertive than ever before,"" Mafi says. ""They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' ""

And while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. ""I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.""

Mafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.

On top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.

For Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. ""I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,"" she says.

Eventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. ""The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,"" Bernstein says. They say, "" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.""

There is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. ""If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,"" Bernstein says.

But the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.

At the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.

Some people find relief through exercise. ""I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,"" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.

A big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. ""I'm finally healing,"" she says.","For Headaches, A Lifestyle Change May Be Better Than A Doctor Visit",2,NPR
story_reviews_00623,"Severely premature babies are more likely to live if they receive intensive-care treatments rather than palliative care to keep them comfortable, according to a U.S. government-funded study published Thursday.

Whether babies born at the extreme edge of viability, generally considered to be 22, 23 or 24 weeks of gestation, should be aggressively medically treated is a controversial issue among pediatric experts. These infants often don’t survive and, even if they do, many have substantial long-term health problems.

This new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides what is thought to be the best, large-scale data in the U.S. to date on this topic. The authors, from many institutions that form a large neonatal research network funded by the National Institutes of Health, studied nearly 5,000 babies born before 27 weeks at two-dozen high-quality hospitals across the country who were followed to 18-22 months of age.

Those who were born at 22 weeks of gestation survived only 5% of the time. Of those who received active treatment to help them breathe or their hearts to beat, 23% lived, 15.4% survived without severe neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy, and 9% survived without severe or moderate neurological impairment.

In comparison, the vast majority—more than 80% -- of those born at week 26 survived with or without active care and nearly 60% had no severe or moderate neurological impairment.

“A large proportion of the variation [in outcome], especially at 22, 23 and 24 weeks, can be explained by differences in whether treatment was initiated,” said Matthew Rysavy, the first author on the paper and a medical student at the University of Iowa.

The findings don’t lead to a clear-cut conclusion about when and whether lifesaving care should be administered to the extremely premature, but provide more data to help inform doctors and families when they make their decision, said Mr. Rysavy.

Just 22% of babies born at 22 weeks were given lifesaving treatments compared with 72% of babies born at week 23 and 97% of babies born at week 24. The type of care they received tended to depend on the hospital where they were born. However, it isn’t clear from the data why the decision was made to provide a particular type of care, and what other factors played a role in the babies’ outcomes besides whether they were given active treatments, said the authors.

Elizabeth Rogers, director of the Intensive Care Nursery Follow Up Program at the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco , who wasn’t involved in the study, called the new study important because it highlights the large variation in outcomes for these very premature infants.

The paper “shows that the question of when a premature infant can survive is so multifactorial and complex that no simple equation is going to be able to predict the outcome for any individual baby,” said Dr. Rogers, a pediatrics professor.

The study suggests that with intervention, more babies may live. “But if meaningful, functional, fully participatory life is what they want, I think the study also shows this is not something we can promise them at these ages,” said Dr. Rogers.

The University of California San Francisco has never resuscitated a baby born at 22 weeks because its own data suggest that at such an early gestational age, the “risks of poor outcome have outweighed the possibility of a really good outcome for families,” said Dr. Rogers, who said she wouldn’t change her clinical practice based on the new study results.

Thursday’s findings also highlight the importance for counseling parents, including about their child’s longer-term prognosis, and the need for a standard approach of what and how to tell them, according to Dr. Rogers.

Part of that conversation could be the survival rate not of all babies born at an early gestational age, but just those who received active treatment, said the University of Iowa’s Mr. Rysavy.

At the University of Iowa’s hospital, after having a conversation with parents of babies born at 22 weeks, the majority want their babies treated, said Edward Bell, another author on the paper and a pediatrics professor at the university.

“These are very difficult decisions and they need to made on a case-by-case basis by the families and physicians,” said Dr. Bell.

Corrections & Amplifications:

Elizabeth Rogers’s last name was misspelled as Rodgers in an earlier version of this article (5/8/15). Also, a statistical result from the study was incorrectly described in an earlier version of this article. The survival rate for all week 22 infants reflected those who received active treatment as well as those who didn’t, not just those who didn’t receive active treatment (5/12/15).

When I was a kid, my parents refused to let me drink coffee because they believed it would “stunt my growth.” It turns out, of course, that this is a myth. Studies have failed, again and again, to show that coffee or caffeine consumption are related to reduced bone mass or how tall people are.

Coffee has long had a reputation as being unhealthy. But in almost every single respect that reputation is backward. The potential health benefits are surprisingly large.

When I set out to look at the research on coffee and health, I thought I’d see it being associated with some good outcomes and some bad ones, mirroring the contradictory reports you can often find in the news media. This didn’t turn out to be the case.

Just last year, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies looking at long-term consumption of coffee and the risk of cardiovascular disease was published. The researchers found 36 studies involving more than 1,270,000 participants. The combined data showed that those who consumed a moderate amount of coffee, about three to five cups a day, were at the lowest risk for problems. Those who consumed five or more cups a day had no higher risk than those who consumed none.",More Consensus on Coffee’s Effect on Health Than You Might Think,3,limits of observational studies

With treatment, usually surgery, 70 percent to 80 percent of patients with Stage 1 lung cancer, and half of those with Stage 2, survive for at least five years. But most lung cancer is diagnosed when the disease is more advanced, leading to lousy overall mortality rates: Just 18 percent of all lung cancer patients survive for five years.

Pulmonologists have tried for years to find ways to detect lung cancer earlier. Experiments using ordinary chest X-rays proved disappointing. Then in 2011, researchers running the National Lung Screening Trial, involving 53,454 smokers and former smokers ages 55 to 74, reported encouraging findings: Patients who received a low-dose CT scan annually for three years were 20 percent less likely to die of lung cancer over an average of 6.5 years than those tested with X-rays.

Those results led to the preventive services task force’s endorsement and, eventually, to Medicare’s approval. “We’re covering evidence-based preventive services for beneficiaries, which will save lives,” Dr. Conway said.

How many lives? While the overwhelming number of people with lung cancer are or were smokers, most smokers don’t develop lung cancer. So although a 20 percent reduction in mortality sounds impressive, it represents a small number of people.

In the national trial, those screened with chest X-rays had about a 1.7 percent chance of dying from lung cancer during the study period; in the CT scan group, it was about 1.4 percent.

For every thousand people screened with a low-dose CT, three fewer died of lung cancer.

Lay people struggle to grasp these kinds of numbers. “They look at me and say, ‘Doc, just tell me what to do,’ ” Dr. Arenberg said.

“I was on birth control for a year after we got married, and then I thought, ‘OK, well, now I’ll start trying to have a baby,’ and for two years nothing happened, so then I started going to get tested to find out what was going on,” Soto told FoxNews.com.

Demand for fertility services has surged over the last several years. In fact, 7.4 million women ages 15 to 44 have used infertility services in their lifetimes.

Pamela’s doctors said her fallopian tubes were blocked and that her only options to get pregnant would be with surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF)— options Pamela did not want to try.

“I hate needles, and I didn’t want to go through all the emotions and the hormone shots,” said Pamela, who added that her health insurance would have paid for three IVF cycles.

Adhesions— which are comprised of internal scar tissue that forms after surgery, infection or trauma— can cause fallopian tubes to become blocked. And if the mucus that lines the tubes is too thick, this can also contribute to blockage. When one or both tubes are blocked, the egg cannot travel to the uterus and the sperm cannot reach the egg.

“After they told me that I would have to do IVF, I started looking for natural ways to solve infertility,” Soto said.

By doing a quick Google search, Pamela and her husband, John Henry Soto, found Clear Passage, a physical therapy clinic in Gainesville, Fla., that treats certain causes of female infertility like blocked fallopian tubes, endometriosis and hormonal dysfunction.

Clear Passage therapists use their hands to soften and massage away adhesions blocking the tubes.

""We feel and we check all the organs in the abdomen and the pelvis, and wherever we feel that tissues or organs won't move in a certain direction with our hands, we’ll stretch them [in that direction], and we’ll hold that stretch until the tissues and adhesions start to deform and give way,"" Belinda Wurn, a physical therapist and co-developer of the Clear Passage treatment, told FoxNews.com.

Physical therapists administer the deep massage-like therapy over five days and 20 hours total.

“It was an uncomfortable pressure,” Pamela said. “I wouldn't describe it as a massage at all. It was like physical therapy— it didn't hurt, but it wasn't a good feeling either.""

In a retrospective study of 1,392 infertile women, published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, the treatment showed a 60 percent success rate in opening at least one fallopian tube and a 57 percent pregnancy rate for women whose tubes have opened.

""We have enough data on enough patients to where we feel were statistically significant in opening blocked tubes, treating endometriosis and treating elevated follicle stimulating hormone,"" Dr. Richard King, a gynecologist and the medical director for Clear Passage Physical Therapy, told FoxNews.com.

Eight months after Pamela received therapy at Clear Passage, she discovered she was pregnant. She wrapped her positive pregnancy test in a box and surprised her husband with the news on Father’s Day.

""I can’t even imagine not having (our daughter) Brianna in our lives right now. She’s just brought so much joy to our lives,"" John Henry Soto told FoxNews.com

In case the Sotos want to try for a second child, King says their therapy has shown long-lasting results.

“We found that this treatment probably lasts a long period of time because we’ve had a lot of patients with blocked fallopian tubes that we’ve done this 20-hour protocol to that have had more than one child,” King said.

Although the founders tout the therapy’s success, some fertility experts have expressed skepticism over their findings.

“When you’re talking about a retrospective report, you’re saying, ‘OK, we treated these people, and these are our results.’ And that’s interesting, and their results were good in some sections, but it's not scientific in the sense of a prospective, randomized, controlled study,” Dr. Joel Batzofin, a fertility specialist at New York Fertility Services, a part of ARC fertility, told FoxNews.com. “They [the patients] were not stratified by disease type, by age, by duration of infertility, by body weight, smokers versus non-smokers, ever pregnant versus never pregnant, male factors— these are all things that have a profound bearing on results.”

Although Batzofin pointed out the importance of further study, he said the therapy may a be useful option for some patients.

“There are women that produce mucus of a thick viscus quality, and it sticks and lodges in there. The fallopian tube at the uterine end is very narrow and it gets blocked in there, so it’s quite easy to imagine that a course of physical therapy is going to soften this up, dislodge it and clear the passage,” Batzofin said.

Batzofin added that compared to surgery or IVF, the side effects are minimal.

“I don’t think that it’s going to be harmful,” he said. “But one has to be careful about raising false expectations.”

The Clear Passage therapy costs around $6,000, and some insurance plans may cover it.

The type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high-calorie foods, researchers report.

An experiment with 24 healthy volunteers found that compared with consuming glucose, consuming fructose — the sugar found in fruits, honey and corn syrup — resulted in more activity in the brain’s reward regions, increased responses to images of food and a tendency to choose eating a high-calorie food over a future monetary reward.

The volunteers drank a 10-ounce glass of cherry-flavored liquid that contained two and a half ounces of fructose or glucose. (Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.

Before having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from “not at all” to “very much.” Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.

The study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.

When choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.

There was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.

“Insulin is released when we consume glucose,” she said. “The pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy. But it also sends a signal to the brain that says ‘you’ve eaten.’ Fructose doesn’t stimulate insulin secretion, and if there’s no insulin, you don’t get the information that you’re full.”

Does this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit, because it contains fructose?

“No,” Dr. Page said. “Don’t stop eating fruit. It has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks — maybe 5 grams in an orange, compared with 25 grams in a 12-ounce can of soda. And it is packed with fiber, which helps slow down the absorption of food, which makes you feel full.”

story_reviews_00629,"The U.K.’s New At-Home HIV Test Is Better Than Anything We Have In The U.S.

In the U.K., checking your HIV status is now nearly as easy as taking a pregnancy test. BioSure UK has begun selling a $45 take-home HIV test that lets customers prick their fingers, smear the blood on a testing stick, and get their HIV results within 15 minutes.

BioSure’s test goes beyond any of the at-home tests available on the U.S. market, which are either not as fast or not as accurate. When asked if any test similar to BioSure’s new take-home test was in development, Tara Goodin, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, said: “The FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications.”

The FDA has approved two take-home HIV tests, but neither has all the strengths of the BioSure test. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. (Users get their results by calling the company.) OraQuick, on the other hand, is an oral-based at-home test that does let users see their results immediately, but it has an 8.3 percent chance of a false negative. (In contrast, BioSure’s blood test has a much lower 0.2 percent chance that a person who is really HIV positive will test negative.)

Both countries have tried to make it easier to be tested. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service offers free HIV testing. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act designates HIV testing as a preventive service, meaning that all insurers must cover it without charging a co-pay.

But if the goal is to let patients test as accurately as possible at home, the United States is falling behind.

The two countries have roughly comparable rates of undetected HIV infections, although they use different methods to make those estimates. In the U.K., Public Health England, a division of the Department of Health, began testing anonymized blood samples that had been collected for other reasons. It adjusted the raw data to mirror the demographics of the U.K. as a whole and estimated that in 2012, 22 percent of all residents with HIV were undiagnosed.

The United States, meanwhile, uses new later-stage HIV cases to estimate who must have been infected but undiagnosed four years earlier. In a 2012 study, researchers estimated that in 2008, approximately 20 percent of all HIV-positive people in the United State were undiagnosed.

That suggests that both countries still face serious gaps in diagnosis. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. (There is a lag of about three months between initial HIV infection and the point at which it is detectable.)

A sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. In a 2008 study of British men who frequented commercial gay venues, 42 percent of the men who tested positive for HIV had never been diagnosed with HIV. This wasn’t because they had never been screened; 81 percent of the undiagnosed men had been tested for HIV previously. Sixty-two percent of these previously screened men erroneously believed themselves to be HIV-negative.

Adopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. There’s a benefit in regular screening, even for patients who don’t wind up connecting with a doctor.

In a small British study of 98 gay and bisexual men who were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive, the use of condoms after the diagnosis doubled relative to the rates of use pre-diagnosis (31 percent to 61 percent of respondents). And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.

The U.K.’s new at-home HIV test won’t reach all the undiagnosed or guarantee that the people who test positive wind up receiving the care they need from a doctor, but letting people check their status quickly and accurately is likely to produce cascading positive effects, as HIV-positive people find it easier to seek care for themselves, warn past partners about exposure, and reduce risk for future partners.

Dr. Tamim Hamid is the CEO and inventor of Theradome, a helmet that he said “uses 80 cold lasers to promote hair growth by stimulating the base of the hair follicle.”

He based his helmet off the findings of Endre Mester, a Hungarian physician who accidentally discovered that lasers can grow hair in mice in 1965.

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

“This has been sitting dormant for many, many years until about 2009. We discovered that the same wavelength of 678 nanometers was able to stimulate hair on humans as well,” Hamid told FoxNews.com.

To further explain how light grows hair Hamid said, “the laser light stimulates the mitochondria at the base of the hair follicle, which is where the stem cells that grow hair are located. Once the hair follicle is reactivated using light energy, the hair reverses the miniaturization process which was induced by the hormone DHT.”

The challenge that Hamid faced was putting this technology into something that was wearable and easy to use.

Board certified dermatologist Dr. Eric Schweiger who has not worked on Theradome, told FoxNews.com that there have been other products that use low level laser technology to grow hair, but Theradome is the first of its kind to be wearable. It doesn’t require anything from the patient apart from wearing the helmet for 20 minutes, two times a week.

“The major benefit of therdome is you wear it as a cap and you don’t have to hold it up to your scalp. I think that will increase compliance,” Schweiger said.

Hamid said that Theradome has helped tens of thousands of people. One of those is Sabra Hardy who suffers from alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that left her with huge bald spots on either side of her head.

“I was using creams that were developed for the coats of animals when they had problems with their coat. I was using oils developed for animals that were dangerous to use and smelled really bad,” Hardy said.

Her hair loss was costly and painful. She spent hundreds of dollars on wigs and was getting steroid injections in her scalp for nearly two years with no signs of progress until she started using Theradome.

According to the Theradome website, 97 percent of subjects saw positive results after 26 weeks of treatment and they reported a 20 percent increase in hair growth.

Schweiger said that Theradome is safe for someone who wants another option in conjunction with other conventional baldness remedies, and that its effectiveness should be studied more over time.

“For patients who are looking for an additional therapy it’s not unreasonable to use. I think we’ll know more as time goes on,” Schweiger said.

As far as the product’s safety, Schweiger said that since the lights are low energy and are not UV, he is confident that Theradome is safe.

“That makes sense, because you’re destroying more fat cells,” said Dr. Jones, a paid consultant who will teach injectors and who treated Ms. Gallagher. In his experience, the first treatment is the most painful.

Not every patient is a good candidate for this treatment, several experts said. If a patient has excess fat and loose skin, Dr. Rohrich said, “you’ll have a crepey neck and need a neck lift” after fat is reduced with the shot. Neck lifts can cost $5,000 or more.

The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly.

Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. That might seem like a lot of pain for the pleasure of a slimmed-down chin, but currently patients looking to part with their double chins must have fat removed through more invasive means, such as liposuction.

The market for the new drug could be a big one.

According to a survey last year by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, nearly 70 percent of respondents listed ""excess fat under the chin/neck"" as a key concern about their appearance. And Americans repeatedly have demonstrated a willingness to shell out money for aesthetic treatments intended to improve their appearance, if not their overall health.

That said, the agency warned Wednesday that the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face. The most common side effects included swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness and areas of hardness in the vicinity of the injection. FDA officials said Kybella should be administered only by a ""licensed health care professional,"" and shouldn't be injected anywhere other than below the chin.

A Kythera representative said Wednesday that the new treatment likely won't be available until June, as it must train doctors to administer Kybella, and that the company would not have more details about the potential cost of the drug until after its launch.

Researchers analyzed 24 randomized control trials to assess the efficacy and safety of the new drugs, called PCSK9 antibodies, in adults with high cholesterol levels. The antibodies target the cholesterol-regulating protein PCSK9 and lower the levels of LDL, the so-called ""bad"" cholesterol, by 60 percent.

The results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, also show that the drugs have a significant effect on reducing heart attacks and overall mortality.

New cholesterol drug could be biggest advance since statins

""It seems that the group that takes them, compared to the group that doesn't, has half the rate of cardiovascular events and mortality as those that don't,"" Dr. Seth S. Martin of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine told CBS News.

Current guidelines suggest cholesterol be treated with statins, a class of drugs that inhibit an enzyme that plays an important role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. But some patients can't tolerate the side effects, which can include headache, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, diarrhea, constipation and nausea or vomiting.

Others have such high cholesterol that taking statins alone is not enough. These new drugs ""could be for someone who needs an addition to statin, or it could be instead of statin,"" Martin said.

SUNDAY, April 19, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Taking aspirin regularly over several years may help prevent gastrointestinal cancers, a new study suggests.

There was a 20 percent lower risk of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon and rectum, among people taking aspirin, said lead researcher Yin Cao, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.

But Cao doesn't think people should start taking aspirin to prevent cancer until more research is done. ""The results of ongoing research to develop more tailored treatment based upon a personalized assessment of risks and benefits is critical before recommending aspirin for preventing cancer,"" she said.

Moreover, patients and their doctors need to consider the potential risks of taking aspirin, including stomach bleeding, Cao said.

However, ""if considered alongside the known benefits of aspirin in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes, our data suggest the possibility that long-term regular aspirin use may have a significant benefit in prevention of the two leading causes of sickness and death in the U.S. and much of the world,"" she said.

The results of the study were to be presented Sunday at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

For the study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on 82,600 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study in 1980 and 47,650 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in 1986. The researchers collected data on aspirin use, risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer.

After up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Among men, prostate cancer was excluded.

Cao's team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin (325 milligrams) two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin. The reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers, including colon cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.

Regular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers. Specifically, no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer, advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer, the researchers said.

Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said.

Getting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least 16 years. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found. And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.

The association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race, history of diabetes, family history of cancer, weight, smoking, regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins, the study authors added.

Eric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said the new study ""confirms the now well-established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract -- cancers of the colon, rectum and esophagus.""

Some, though not all, previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, he added.

""Although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack, and has some benefits for cancer risk as well, at this point the American Cancer Society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks,"" Jacobs said.

While not common, aspirin can cause serious, even occasionally fatal, stomach bleeding, even at low doses, he said.

""People who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider, who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits,"" Jacobs said.

story_reviews_00637,"(Reuters) - A combination of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs that help the immune system fight melanoma led to significantly greater tumor shrinkage than treatment with one of the medicines, according to a midstage study presented on Monday.

The combination of Yervoy and the newer Opdivo also reduced the risk of disease progression by 60 percent compared with Yervoy alone through 11 months of follow-up in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma, researchers found.

The overall response rate, defined as tumors that shrank by at least 30 percent, was 61 percent for the 72 patients who received the combination versus 11 percent among the 27 who got Yervoy alone.

Twenty-two percent of those combination patients had a complete response, meaning no sign of tumor. There were no complete responses with Yervoy alone.

“The response rates and the depth of responses are quite impressive,” Dr. Stephen Hodi, director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-lead author of the study, said in an interview.

The median time it took for Yervoy patients to see their cancer worsen was 4.4 months. But after 11 months, more than half of the combination group had yet to see their disease worsen. Overall survival data was not yet available.

“Longer follow-up will be helpful to see the durability of these responses and what happens to patients who had complete responses,” said Hodi, who presented data from the Checkpoint-069 study at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Yervoy, also known as ipilimumab, had been the first immunotherapy to extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. It works by taking the brakes off the immune system to more efficiently attack cancer. Opdivo (nivolumab) belongs to a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system.

In a separate group of 33 patients with a mutation of the BRAF gene involved in cancer cell growth, the overall response rate was 52 percent for the combination. The complete response rate was 22 percent. That compared with 1 percent overall response rate and no complete responses for Yervoy alone.

The combination of the two drugs also led to far higher levels of side effects, such as colitis and inflammation of lung tissue, at 54 percent versus 24 percent for Yervoy alone. Patients were also more likely to stop taking the combination of drugs.

“Most of the patients who stopped for toxicity continued to benefit,” said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of development for Yervoy and Opdivo.",Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study,2,Cancer
story_reviews_00638,"In 2012, I was shocked to learn that new guidelines issued by the The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that women should wait three to five years between pap smears, which are the primary method of screening for cervical cancer. Thanks to that recommendation, which has influenced insurance company policies, annual pap tests are no longer the standard of care today— and I see that as a huge problem.

For one, the three- to five-year interval between screening tests for women ages 21 to 65 doesn’t take into account the several risk factors that boost a woman’s chance of developing cervical cancer, such as multiple sexual partners, a weakened immune system that occurs with smoking, and even oral contraceptive use for more than five years. For these women, there is a still a serious need for more frequent cervical cancer screening, but nowhere in the guidelines are these risk factors addressed. Unfortunately, the only risk factor that changes the recommended frequency of screening is an abnormal pap result in the past.

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

I watched a 28-year-old woman die of cervical cancer during my OB-GYN residency, and it was horrible. I don’t see why major medical organizations have made a recommendation that puts women at risk of a cancer that can be so easily prevented— and frankly, I see it as more of an economic decision than anything else.

Let’s take a closer look at what this means: Let’s say you have multiple sexual partners and during a visit to your gynecologist, this information flies under the radar for whatever reason. (A woman with multiple sexual partners has a greater chance of acquiring HPV, the virus that causes most cervical cancers.) By the same token, no one brings up the issue of your partner’s number of partners. And by the way, you can never be 100 percent positive that your partner is monogamous— no one can! The greater the number of partners he has, the greater his risk of contracting HPV and passing it to you. So you aren’t given cervical cancer screening that day when, in fact, many doctors would agree that you need it.

Another problem I have with the current guidelines is this: New recommendations published last summer in the Annals of Internal Medicine advised physicians to stop offering routine pelvic exams to asymptomatic, average-risk women. I find this outrageous. Pelvic exams allow your physician to inspect the vulva for changes, and even feel around the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes for any masses. The delay to diagnosis of vulvar cancer, specifically, is about 18 months. A gynecologist is trained to detect early changes, and then do a biopsy for anything suspicious. As a diagnostic and screening tool, the pelvic exam is vital.

What makes all of this even worse: No more pelvic exams and infrequent paps mean women won’t see their gynecologist as regularly, and they may miss opportunities to voice concerns related to their reproductive health. An annual well-woman visit with your gynecologist allows you to discuss your health status, sexual practices, contraception needs, and get a breast exam, among other things— so it’s still important for you to go, even if you don’t end up having a pap or pelvic exam.

Ultimately, when it comes to gynecological cancer screening tests, every woman has individual risk factors, so you should talk to your doctor about yours. If you fall into any of the high risk categories— you have multiple partners, you smoke or are otherwise immunocompromised, and you’ve been on birth control pills for five years or more— you really should be screened at least every other year. If you’re insurance denies to cover this, you should fight them on the basis of being at a higher risk.

And always be sure to visit your gyno if you’re having any sort of symptom, such as pelvic pain, irregular discharge, or sexual dysfunction— all of which can point to a more serious problem. In these cases, you should be given a pelvic exam at the very least.

In an article published Thursday in the journal Neuron, scientists at the University of California-San Diego have found that children with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, with good language outcomes have strikingly distinct patterns of brain activation as compared to those with poor language outcomes and typically developing toddlers.

""Why some toddlers with ASD get better and develop good language and others do not has been a mystery that is of the utmost importance to solve,"" Eric Courchesne, one of the study’s authors and co-director of the University of California-San Diego's Autism Center, said in a statement.

The images of the children in the study -- MRIs of the brain -- were taken at 12 to 29 months while their language was assessed one to two years later at 30 to 48 months.

Such research has become critically important as the number of children diagnosed with autism has soared in recent decades to 1 in 68. Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers. Autism is considered by most experts to be a lifelong condition, but numerous studies have found that children's outcomes improve with early therapy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of state and federal funding are being spent each year to provide help to children and adults with autism and being able to pinpoint children at risk in the early years could help direct those public resources to where they could do the most good.

Brain imaging has become a popular subject of research in recent years as the technology to be able to scan, store and analyze the terabytes of information in the pictures has become more affordable. Scientists at a growing number of research centers are pinning their hopes that these images will help them unlock some of the secrets of everything from what causes childhood disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to how neurons in the brain process vision and memory.

story_reviews_00640,"Toni Weiser is a veteran of skin-cancer removals. The 75-year-old retired teacher in Santa Fe, N.M., says she’s had at least eight basal and squamous cell cancers scraped, frozen and surgically excised from her arms, face and shoulders.

When a basal-cell cancer reappeared on Mrs. Weiser’s nose last year, her dermatologist suggested a new, painless, nonsurgical treatment and she eagerly agreed. After 16 treatments with a small radiation device held millimeters from her nose, the tumor was gone. “I felt nothing—just some mild itching,” she says. “I much prefer radiation to having something dug out of my nose with a scalpel.”

The new procedure, called surface electronic brachytherapy, or eBx, is beginning to cause a stir in the world of non-melanoma skin cancers, the most common type of cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology’s official position is that surgery is the most effective treatment, and that more long-term data is needed before the safety and effectiveness of eBx can be determined.

Last month, an editorial in the journal JAMA Dermatology raised other concerns. Noting that use of the procedure has risen 20-fold in recent years, to 24,000 procedures in 2013, the authors said that makers of the eBx equipment are marketing it to “busy people” who “aren’t interested in surgery” and pitching it to dermatology practices as a moneymaking service. Medicare reimbursements can run as high as $24,000 per patient, compared with $200 to $2100 for typical skin-cancer treatments, the authors said.

Officials for the two companies that make eBx equipment—Xoft Inc. and Elekta Inc. —say they agree that surgery is still the standard of care for non-melanoma skin cancers, but that eBx offers an attractive option for patients who can’t, or don’t want to, have surgery.

More than 3.6 million Americans are diagnosed with basal or squamous cell cancers every year—more than all other cancers combined. Unlike melanomas, they are rarely fatal. But they can invade surrounding tissues and become disfiguring. Dermatologists almost always recommend removing them.

Standard treatments depend on the size, type, location and depth of the tumor and the patients age. They range from topical creams to burning, freezing, and Mohs surgery, where layers of tumor-containing skin are progressively removed until no cancer remains.

Radiation has also been used for decades, typically for skin cancers that are hard to reach, for patients who can’t tolerate surgery, or in addition to surgery for high-risk lesions. Those treatments usually take place in a hospital or radiation oncology center, with lead-lined rooms and linear accelerators.

The new eBx treatment uses a miniaturized X-ray source in a small mobile unit that can be wheeled from room to room in a doctor’s office. Radiation is delivered directly to the cancer site by a mechanical arm with minimal shielding so the therapist can stay by the patient’s side.

Xoft, whose Axxent eBx device is the market leader, estimates that about one-third of patients with non-melanoma skin cancers—more than 1 million a year—are potential candidates for the new treatment, including those whose cancers are in prominent places like the eyes, ears and nose. Tumors must be less than four centimeters wide and no more than five millimeters deep for eBx treatment, Xoft says.

“We have a great, nonsurgical, painless alternative to what can be a very time-consuming and painful procedure, and we are getting very effective clinical outcomes,” says Ken Ferry, CEO of Xoft’s parent company iCAD Inc. He says Xoft has sold about 100 units, mostly to dermatology practices, since 2011, although the company and some states require that a radiation oncologist administer the treatment.

Elekta Inc., a large Swedish maker of radiation equipment, has a competing device called the Esteya. It has installed fewer than 25 to date in the U.S., says Jay Hoey, president and CEO of Elekta Holdings, North America.

Both companies say research from older treatments shows that radiation is safe and effective for non-melanoma skin cancers. Mr. Ferry says that in six studies to date, some 1,300 patients, with 1,900 lesions, have been treated with eBx, and some have been followed for as long as four years. The most common side effects are temporary redness, dryness, itching, soreness and blistering. Only nine recurrences of the skin cancer have been reported.

Some dermatologists say the experience with older radiation treatments isn’t comparable, adding that the median follow-ups in the eBx studies are just a few months. Skin cancer recurrences and severe side effects can take four or more years to appear.

One concern is that skin subjected to radiation can turn white and develop fibrous tissue that tightens, thickens and blocks blood supply.

Radiation itself can cause secondary cancers decades later. “I have 70- and 80-year-old patients with extensive skin cancers where they had radiation for acne when they were kids,” says Jack Resneck, a professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco, who co-wrote the JAMA Dermatology editorial. “The younger you are when you are treated, the longer you have to develop those secondary cancers.”

Ajay Bhatnagar, a radiation oncologist in Casa Grande, Ariz., who has led several eBx studies and receives research funds from Xoft, says he turns away patients under age 50 due to the risk of secondary cancers, although he notes the risk is low, at only about 0.1% a year.

Mohs has disadvantages, too, including scars and the need for reconstructive surgery in some cases, says Christopher Zachary, a professor of dermatology at University of California, Irvine, whose practice offers both Mohs and eBx.

“There are patients in their 70s and 80s who say, ‘Stop. I don’t want to have any more cutting. I’ve had enough,’ which is not unreasonable,” he says. He is planning to lead a multi-center randomized trial treating 500 patients with either Mohs or eBx with a five-year follow-up.

The cost issue is more complicated. The eBx treatment has a temporary billing code originally used for breast and brain radiation, for which Medicare pays $770 to $1,600 per treatment. With 8 treatments per skin cancer, plus facility and other fees, practices can earn as much as $24,000 per patient, according to a Xoft analysis provided to inquiring dermatologists.

By contrast, older forms of radiation for skin cancer are reimbursed as little as $27 a treatment. Medicare reimbursement for Mohs surgery and repair is typically less than $2,000, dermatologists say.

As of now, Medicare covers eBx in 21 Western and Midwestern states. It covers the treatment on a case-by-case basis in Texas and the South and doesn't cover it in Florida or New England, where it is more difficult to find. Private insurance coverage also varies.

The American Academy of Dermatologists is concerned that such high reimbursement rates for eBx could draw scrutiny from government regulators.

ASTRO, the professional organization for radiation oncologists, is also wary. “We think radiation has a valuable role in the treatment of selected skin cancers,” says the group’s president-elect David Beyer. “But you as a consumer should get the treatment that’s best for you, not best for your doctor.”

Mrs. Weiser, who paid only $90 for the treatment after Medicare and supplemental insurance, is convinced that eBx was best for her. “If I can possibly avoid Mohs surgery again, I will,” she says.

Another veteran of many skin cancers, Rick Cox, age 62, of Cave Creek, Ariz., paid $8,000 out of pocket for eBx rather than have surgery, and a possible skin graft, on his nose. He is so happy with the results he now hands out brochures about it to all of his friends.

story_reviews_00641,"Eating for two is exciting, but comes with a lot of baggage: weight gain, uncontrollable cravings for ice cream and pickles, and constant concern over whether your growing baby is getting all the nutrients it needs, to name a few.

Now, findings published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism reveal that most women aren’t getting enough omega-3 fatty acids – healthy fats found in fish, walnuts, avocados and supplements. Specifically, they aren’t getting enough DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega 3-LCPUFA) that's critical to a baby's brain development. DHA is primarily obtained by eating fish and other seafood.

For the study, researchers from Canada's University of Alberta studied 600 women during and after pregnancy to monitor their intake of omega 3-LCPUFAs. These include DHA, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid). DHA is believed to be the biggest player in neurological health and is the primary structural fat found in the brain.

The American Dietetic Association recommends that healthy adults, including pregnant and lactating women, get at least 500 milligrams per day of omega 3-LCPUFAs. Meanwhile, the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids advises that pregnant and lactating women consume at least 200 mg of DHA per day.

The researchers found that only 27 percent of women during pregnancy and 25 percent of women three-months postpartum were meeting those DHA recommendations.

The Power of DHA

“Omega 3s are needed for the infant’s brain and nervous system to develop properly,” says contributing study author Catherine Field, a registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at the University of Alberta. “Also, the membranes of every cell in a person’s body contain omega-3 fatty acids. They are needed for the cell to grow and function.” After all, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, babies are doing at lot of growing.

What’s more, during pregnancy omega-3 fatty acids are required for mom’s body to produce more red blood cells so that she can provide enough nutrients and oxygen to her growing baby. These fatty acids also help the placenta grow and function as needed, Field says. It’s this placenta that omega-3 fatty acids including DHA diffuse across to reach the baby and spur brain development, says Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, past president of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as professor and director of the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

Not surprisingly, low intake of DHA in moms is linked to babies with lower cognitive development (often associated with crying and poor sleep) as well as lower IQs and attention deficit disorders, Field says. What’s more, her previous research in both animals and humans shows that DHA intake during breastfeeding impacts infants’ immune system development, which may explain why babies who receive low amounts of DHA through breast milk have an increased risk of asthma and allergies. She also notes that DHA supplementation may help prevent preterm labor, preeclampsia and postpartum depression.

However, whether DHA benefits more than babies' brain health isn't conclusive. “Data from observational studies and from randomized controlled trials suggest that omega-3 during pregnancy could be associated with several benefits such as lower risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and other obstetrics complications. However, there are contradicting results,” Berghella says.

In fact, Berghella’s 2015 review of 34 randomized controlled trials found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with decreases in risk. However, the review did find that women with single-child pregnancies (no multiples) had a 73 percent lower risk of stillbirth or early infant death if they began supplementation by 20 weeks into their pregnancies.

How to Get More DHA

Sushi’s one thing, but during pregnancy, you shouldn’t lay off seafood entirely, Berghella says. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women eat at least two servings of fish or shellfish (about 8 to 12 ounces) every week. But take care to choose low-mercury options such as shrimp, salmon and catfish. The group recommends avoiding shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, and limiting white tuna consumption to 6 ounces per week.

Hitting those recommendations will get you approximately 1,400 mg of DHA per week, Berghella says. (While that’s not exactly 200 mg per day, if you average your intake out over the course of a 7-day week, you still hit recommended amounts.) In the University of Alberta study, seafood, fish and seaweed products contributed to 79 percent of women’s omega 3-LCPUFA intakes from food. The biggest source: salmon. Good thing, as a 2007 study published in The Lancet found that children born to mothers who reported no seafood intake had the greatest risk of behavioral problems and poor scores on early developmental and IQ tests.

If you don’t eat seafood, DHA supplements can help, says Dr. Gabriele Saccone of the University of Naples Federico II’s department of neuroscience and Berghella’s collaborator. But if you do take supplements, opt for fish-oil varieties, since DHA from fish may be more beneficial than getting it from vegetarian supplements, according to Saccone. And no worries, they are low in mercury.

Even if you are eating some seafood – just not quite two servings per week – a fish-oil supplement could still help. In the current study, women who took a supplement were 11 times more likely to get 200 mg of DHA per week during pregnancy and lactation compared to those who went supplement-free. Apart from taking supplements, Field also recommends eating foods enriched with DHA, such as milk and eggs.

Wondering about avocados, walnuts and olive oil? While they are all filled with omega-3 fatty acids, they aren’t of the DHA variety. These plant sources of omega-3s contain ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which, while good for you, has a hard time converting into DHA so that it can really benefit baby’s brain development, Berghella says. In North Americans and Europeans, only about 4 percent of all ALA consumed becomes EPA or DHA, Field says.",Pregnant Women: Get More Omega-3s,3,Diet studies

Jamie Stagl worries that women with breast cancer don't get enough help coping with their diagnosis. Cancer upends a woman's daily routine, her sense of her body, her vision of the future. There's almost nothing more stressful.

The women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and — according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer — an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn't be found or didn't want to participate.)

The positive results surprised even Stagl. ""It's quite amazing,"" she said.

Stagl doesn't know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught — which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family. But the study suggests that they have internalized the strategies.

Women may be particularly receptive to these approaches when they're coping with a cancer diagnosis, said Laura S. Porter, an associate professor at Duke University Medical Center. ""This is really a teachable moment.""

The skills taught in the course are useful at many stressful moments, Porter said, not just when cancer is diagnosed. But most people aren't explicitly trained how to cope with stressful events.

""These are really good life skills,"" Porter said. ""While I certainly wouldn't say that anyone could take a 10-week course and be set for life, I think anyone could take a 10-week course and be much better at coping with stress.""

Next, the study team, led by Michael Antoni of the University of Miami, hopes to show that an easier-to-manage five-week group class works as well as the 10-week one.

And researchers want to know whether relaxation actually reduces the recurrence of breast cancer. It makes biological sense, Stagl said. Stress drives up levels of the hormone cortisol, which is known to weaken the immune system. If a woman's stress level remains high indefinitely after diagnosis, she may have a worse outcome than if she can bring it back down, Stagl said.

istockphoto Doctors have been saying for years that what you eat can affect the health of your heart. Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it ""moderately well"" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of ""many factors that play into who gets the disease,"" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 ""brain healthy food groups"" a person should eat and five ""unhealthy food groups"" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.

Green leafy vegetables istockphoto The MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.

Other vegetables istockphoto Like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health, the MIND diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health. The researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

Nuts istockphoto Nuts are a good snack for brain health, according to the MIND diet study. Nuts contain healthy fats, fiber and antioxidants, and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. The MIND diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week.

Berries istockphoto Berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. ""Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,"" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.

Beans istockphoto If beans aren't a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

Whole grains Tom Perkins Whole grains are a key component of the MIND diet. It recommends at least three servings a day.

Fish istockphoto The MIND diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function. However, there's no need to go overboard; unlike the Mediterranean diet, which recommends eating fish almost every day, the MIND diet says once a week is enough.

Poultry Shaiith Poultry is another part of a brain-healthy eating plan, according to the MIND diet. It recommends two or more servings a week.

Olive oil istockphoto Olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the MIND diet. The researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline.

Wine istockphoto Raise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 ""brain healthy"" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer's: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia...

Red meat juniart Red meat isn't banned in the MIND diet, but the researchers say you should limit consumption to no more than four servings a week to help protect brain health. That's more generous than the Mediterranean diet, which restricts red meat to just one serving a week.

Butter and stick margarine istockphoto Butter and stick margarine should be limited to less than a tablespoon per day on the MIND diet. Brain-healthy olive oil can often be used instead.

Cheese istockphoto Cheese may be delicious but it doesn't do your brain any favors, according to the MIND diet study. Eat cheese no more than once a week if you want to reduce your risk of Alzheimer's.

Pastries and sweets istockphoto You already know they're not so good for your waistline, and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well. The MIND diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week.",The MIND diet: 10 foods that fight Alzheimer's (and 5 to avoid),2,Alzheimer's

MaryAnn Anselmo feared for the worst when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a glioblastoma in late 2013.

""You start doing research on that type of tumor, and you're saying, 'Oh my God, you're history.' It's like a death sentence,"" says, Anselmo, now 59.

Only for her it wasn't.

Anselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine — tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs — is beginning to transform cancer care.

At first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.

toggle caption WNYC

The chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.

The year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.

After all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies — drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.

The family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.

Her oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.

Knowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. ""It's like you're in a parking lot,"" Hyman says. ""And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.""

Today, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.

There are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.

Now she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.

As this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.

""We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,"" Hyman, her oncologist, says.

Still, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. ""Every patient is different in how long it works,"" he says. ""We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.""

There's no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn't have had otherwise.

After all the misfortunes she's been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky. But she doesn't see it that way. No, she says after rehearsing for her comeback show, ""I'm the luckiest.""

story_reviews_00646,"Cancer experts said Tuesday that the actress and filmmaker Angelina Jolie Pitt was wise to have had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed last week because she carries a genetic mutation, BRCA1, that significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer, a disease so difficult to detect that it is often found only at an advanced, untreatable stage.

They also said Ms. Jolie Pitt’s decision to discuss her own choices so frankly will encourage women in similar situations to consider their own options. BRCA mutations cause about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. It is unclear how common the mutations are in other racial and ethnic groups.

“Prophylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is strongly recommended in women before age 40 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers,” said Dr. Susan Domchek, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Basser Research Center, which specializes in BRCA mutations. “There is no effective screening for ovarian cancer and too many women with advanced stage ovarian cancer die of their disease.”

Writing for The New York Times’s Op-Ed page, Ms. Jolie Pitt, 39, said she had expected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, a procedure called a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but that a cancer scare made her decide to undergo the procedure sooner.

MONDAY, March 23, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements may slow or prevent low-grade prostate cancer from progressing, a small new study suggests.

""Vitamin D decreases inflammation in tissues, and inflammation is a driver of cancer,"" explained Bruce Hollis, the study's lead researcher and a professor of pediatrics, biochemistry and molecular biology at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.

For the study, researchers randomly assigned 37 men who elected to have their prostate removed to receive either 4,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or an inactive placebo daily for 60 days before their operation.

When the prostate gland was examined after their surgery, researchers found that many who received vitamin D had improvements in their prostate tumors, while the tumors in the placebo group remained the same or got worse.

""In greater than 60 percent of those taking it, vitamin D actually made the cancer better,"" said Hollis.

Hollis reported that in some cases the tumor shrank and in others the cancer went away. However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added.

Doctors often recommend a ""watch and wait"" period for men with low-grade, or less aggressive, prostate tumors. But many patients and their families aren't comfortable waiting and opt to have surgery before it's deemed medically necessary. These findings suggest that taking vitamin D might help reduce the need for such radical treatment.

But Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer.

""It's premature to make any conclusions,"" he said. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said.

D'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.

Vitamin D, known as the ""sunshine vitamin,"" is produced by the body when it's exposed to sun. It's also found in fortified dairy products and fatty fish.

The study results were scheduled for presentation Monday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

story_reviews_00648,"For years, negative reports have surrounded artificial sweeteners, claiming evidence of everything from being a carcinogen to causing cardiovascular disease. But now new research suggests a popular sugar substitute could lead to new treatments for some of the most common types of cancers.

In findings presented at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), a team of researchers from the University of Florida College of Medicine examined how saccharin, the artificial sweetener that is the main ingredient in Sweet 'N Low®, Sweet Twin® and Necta®, reacted with a protein found in aggressive cancer cells.

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

The protein, called carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), regulates pH in and around cancer cells, allowing tumors to thrive and potentially metastasize to other parts of the body. It is found in a wide range of aggressive cancers, including breast, lung, liver, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancer.

“If you disrupt this pH balance via blocking CA IX activity, you can stop these cancer cells from growing and proliferating,” study author Brian Mahon, a graduate research assistant at the University of Florida, told FoxNews.com.

Mahon said the research stemmed from a study from the University of Florence in Italy that suggested saccharin would selectively block the activity of CA IX. He said his team, led by University of Florida’s Dr. Robert McKenna, wanted to further investigate saccharin’s effect in treating cancer.

""It never ceases to amaze me how a simple molecule such as saccharin— something many people put in their coffee every day— may have untapped uses, including as a possible lead compound to target aggressive cancers,"" McKenna said.

CA IX is not normally found in healthy human cells. McKenna said that’s why it’s a prime target for anti-cancer drugs, as they would cause little to no side effects to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Previous attempts to find an element that blocks CA IX without damaging other cells have been unsuccessful.

Researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine how saccharin binds to CA IX, and are using that information to develop ways to fine-tune and improve its anti-cancer treatment potential. The goal is to develop drugs that could slow the growth of these cancers and potentially make them less resistant to chemo or radiation therapies. Currently, saccharin’s effects are being tested on breast and liver cancer cells.

""This result opens up the potential to develop a novel anti-cancer drug that is derived from a common condiment that could have a lasting impact on treating several cancers,"" McKenna said.

Researchers warn the findings don’t warrant adding large quantities of artificial sweeteners to your diet, but they say their findings may offer promise for the development of an anti-cancer drug derived from an ingredient that ironically was once considered a possible carcinogen.","Artificial sweetener may help treat aggressive cancers, study finds",2,Cancer
story_reviews_00649,"Bone-health experts are making a new push to reduce rates of osteoporosis, with a particular focus on controlling the bone-wasting disease in men.

An important goal is to get greater numbers of men to be tested for osteoporosis when they come to a hospital or clinic with a fracture to the wrist, vertebrae or other bones that wasn’t from a major accident or trauma. Doctors call this a fragility fracture—one that results from a decrease in bone density.

A recent study of about 440 people over 50 years old found women were about three times as likely as men (53% versus 18%) to be tested using a bone-density scan after suffering a distal-radial fracture, or broken wrist, a common warning sign of early osteoporosis. The study, conducted by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, was published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Bare Bones Osteoporosis, commonly thought of as a women’s disease, also affects many men. Osteoporosis occurs when bone tissue breaks down faster than it is replaced, causing bones to become less dense and more likely to fracture.

A broken bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis. Breakages are most common in the wrist, spine or hip.

About half of women over age 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis. As many as one in four men will suffer a breakage.

Men are twice as likely as women to die in the year following a hip fracture.

Bone density, which peaks between ages 20 and 30, declines with age and especially in women after menopause. A bone density test, a type of Xray, can diagnose osteoporosis.

The higher your bone density was at its peak, the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis. Sources: National Osteoporosis Foundati

The National Bone Health Alliance, a public-private partnership managed by the nonprofit National Osteoporosis Foundation, is nearing completion of a year-long pilot project at three hospitals to test programs called fracture-liaison services that make bone-density tests routine for patients over 50 with fragility fractures.

Such tests currently are recommended in the treatment guidelines of various medical groups. They also are regularly performed at some U.S. managed-care organizations, including Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and some national health-care systems, such as in the U.K. But experts say the majority of patients in the U.S., especially men, don’t get tested for osteoporosis after suffering a fragility fracture.

Osteoporosis is commonly thought of as a women’s disease, but as many as one in four men in the U.S. over the age of 50 will break a bone as a result of the condition, more than will have prostate cancer, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. By comparison, one out of two women will break a bone from osteoporosis. The disease also is a common cause of hip fractures, and men are twice as likely as women to die in the year after suffering a broken hip, says the Switzerland-based International Osteoporosis Foundation. The IOF made men the focus of World Osteoporosis Day in October and released an in-depth report called “Osteoporosis in Men: Why Change Needs to Happen.”

Robert Spezzano, 54, an assistant principal at an independent high school in Washington, D.C., fell off his bicycle in the fall, breaking his wrist and elbow. After surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, which is participating in the pilot project, he got a call from the hospital’s fracture-liaison-service coordinator suggesting he make an appointment for a bone-density test. “I was real skeptical, got real defensive about the term fragility fracture,” says Mr. Spezzano. “I fell hard, so I wasn’t surprised my arm broke.”

When the test results clearly showed osteoporosis, Mr. Spezzano says he was “blown away. My mind was racing. You just think it’s a woman’s disease.” Although his doctor recommended prescription medication, Mr. Spezzano says he plans first to sharply step up his exercise regimen and take vitamin D supplements to see if that helps.

Andrea Singer, leader of the project at MedStar Georgetown, says results of the pilot haven’t yet been compiled, but the number of patients post-fracture who are identified, assessed for osteoporosis and put on treatment if needed is up significantly.

Patients “aren’t necessarily thrilled with the diagnosis, but they’re thrilled that someone is looking at the whole person,” Dr. Singer says.

Bone tissue is always breaking down. When it isn’t replaced fast enough, bones become less dense and prone to breakage, even with a relatively minor fall or bump. Tests for osteoporosis include a bone-density scan, a type of X-ray of the hip, wrist or spine, and blood or urine tests to check calcium and vitamin D levels.

Bone density declines gradually as people age, and especially for women after menopause. Factors like family history and lifestyle contribute to people’s risk for getting osteoporosis. Some medications, such as corticosteroids or androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, and some underlying medical conditions also can promote the condition.

When osteoporosis isn’t too severe or the patient is relatively young, doctors may recommend calcium or vitamin D supplements, diet changes or more weight-bearing exercise, which strengthens bones. People with a greater risk of future fractures may be put on medications called bisphosphonates, which slow bone breakdown and slightly increase bone mass. Bisphosphonates, sold under brand names such as Fosamax and Actonel, are highly effective. But because of some possible, rare side effects—an unusual type of fracture of the thigh bone and a deterioration of the jaw bone—the medication often isn’t prescribed for more than five years.

Many men “think they can’t get osteoporosis. A man will say, ‘Oh, it was a really bad fall’,” says Richard Dell, head of Kaiser Permanente Southern California’s fracture-liaison service until he retired last year. Care managers at Kaiser order a bone-density scan for everyone over 50 whose fracture results from a simple fall. A clinic sees patients who have abnormal scans, does lab tests and prescribes treatment if needed.

Since the service was launched in 1997, the rate of hip fractures at Kaiser is down 40%, says Dr. Dell, an improvement he attributes in large part to the fracture-liaison service. Dr. Dell currently advises the National Osteoporosis Foundation on its effort to get more hospitals to adopt the services.

A key goal of the hospital pilot project, which is funded by Merck & Co., the maker of Fosamax, is to find out if a fracture-liaison service can be effective in a non-managed-care environment. Among other things, the project has been testing systems to keep track of patients who might receive follow-up care from multiple providers. It eventually plans to make the systems available to hospitals launching such services.

Although managed-care-hospital networks can save money by reducing hip fractures in their patients, other hospitals stand to forgo $25,000 or more for every hip surgery they don’t perform. Many experts believe fracture-liaison services will be more widely adopted once Medicare, the big government insurer, pegs more of its payments to patients’ overall health outcomes.

“When they put in more pay-for-performance programs, that’s when it will really get attention,” says Douglas Dirschl, chairman of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation at University of Chicago Medicine, which isn’t participating in the pilot project. Fracture-liaison services represent “the best chance we have” for getting men and women evaluated and treated for osteoporosis, he says.",Men Are New Target for Osteoporosis Treatment,3,Wall Street Journal
story_reviews_00650,"(CNN) It's a portable piece of technology providing seemingly bottomless access to a drug craved by more than 1 billion people worldwide -- nicotine. That craving is caused by smoking tobacco but is now being increasingly satisfied by e-cigarettes and the trend to ""vape"" instead of smoke.

The selling point is the clean image e-cigarettes purvey by removing the simultaneous exposure to the tar and thousands of chemicals found in the tobacco smoke of regular cigarettes -- removing the cause of lung diseases as well as other tobacco-related conditions.

Tobacco kills almost 6 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and a growing number of people are now ""vaping"" instead of smoking, resulting in industry worth $2.7 billion worldwide.

Since their introduction in 2006, e-cigarettes have become commonplace among smokers trying to kick their habit, with a third of smokers trying to quit in the United Kingdom turning to e-cigarettes to aid them, according to one study . But some critics argue these electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are fueling a new addiction to nicotine -- particularly among young people experimenting with them.

Allure for adolescents

""While ENDS may have the potential to benefit established adult smokers ... [they] should not be used by youth and adult non-tobacco users because of the harmful effects of nicotine and other risk exposures,"" says Tim McAfee, director the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Exposure to nicotine can harm adolescent brain development.""

Studies conducted by the CDC through its Adult and Youth National Tobacco Surveys found increased experimentation by youth trying out e-cigarettes but not conventional cigarettes. The gadgetry and flavors associated with the devices is suggested as a reason behind this, with fears of them acting as a gateway into real tobacco smoking.

Benan Barwick/CNN Benan Barwick/CNN

But others in the field of tobacco control disagree, stating that whilst people -- including youth -- may have tried e-cigarettes, the evidence is lacking for their regular use. ""Kids like new technology and just experiment or use it once or twice,"" says Jean-Francois Etter, professor of Public Health at the University of Geneva.

Etter has been researching the use of e-cigarettes since 2009 and believes they are much safer than conventional cigarettes. ""The most dangerous way of consuming nicotine is to smoke it,"" he says. Etter argued this point last week at the World Conference of Tobacco or Health in Abu Dhabi.

Whilst Etter says that use among young people should be monitored, he believes the role of e-cigarettes in reducing global tobacco consumption is more important. ""They are a gateway out of smoking,"" says Etter. The number of people using a combination of tobacco and e-cigarettes is on the rise, according to Etter, resulting in smokers switching and consuming less tobacco each day. ""[They have] the same level of nicotine but people are less exposed to toxins ... nicotine is not a health problem,"" he says. However, further evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes or nicotine is needed.

Satisfying the craving

Nicotine is the main substance keeping people addicted to smoking tobacco and consequently exposing them to the tar and toxins found in cigarettes. Whilst many people try to kick the habit cold turkey, nicotine replacement through gums and patches has long been advocated as a helping hand. ""Nicotine withdrawal is a very unpleasant process,"" says Linda Bauld, professor of Health Policy at the University of Stirling, whose recent report for Public Health England identified an extensive and growing market for e-cigarettes worldwide.

""The vast number of people using e-cigarettes are using them to stop smoking; [they're] about 60% more effective than going cold turkey or buying nicotine replacement therapy over the counter.""

Bauld's research hasn't identified a dependence on nicotine with e-cigarettes in the same way as the addiction resulting from regular cigarettes. ""E-cigarettes are not the best nicotine delivery devices,"" she says referring to the fact nicotine is not seen to enter the bloodstream as readily when using e-cigarettes. That's backed up by Etter's research as well as a recent study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine, in which e-cigarettes were found to be less addictive than tobacco cigarettes.

Benan Barwick/CNN Benan Barwick/CNN

They do, however, provide nicotine more effectively than aids such as patches or gums, according to Bauld.

""Patches and gums are a very small market,"" says Etter about the quitting devices which first came onto the market 40 years ago. He fears too much restriction on e-cigarettes will limit their impact in achieving a world free of tobacco.

Both Bauld and Etter recognize the need to monitor the consumption of nicotine among teenagers but feel the value of e-cigarettes among adult smokers and their potential to save lives by reducing tobacco consumption should not be underestimated -- a sentiment recognized by the World Health Organization.

""[E-cigarettes] could be a way to help people quit but we need more evidence and regulation,"" says Armand Peruga, program manager for the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative , which has celebrated 10 years of its Framework for Tobacco Control whilst at the conference in Abu Dhabi.

Legislate and regulate

The greatest impact to date in reducing the number of smokers worldwide has been the taxation and legislation restricting tobacco advertising and increasing prices. ""For every 10% increase in tax you have 4% reduction in tobacco consumption,"" says Peruga.

The growing fear is the increasing domination of big tobacco in the e-cigarette market, which was once seen as a competitor. Their ownerships of popular e-cigarette brands could push out smaller companies in the field, reminiscent of the original tobacco epidemic.

""The intent of big tobacco is to sell their product,"" concludes Peruga. ""[They may] expand their market to other customers who didn't use cigarettes but might consider nicotine use.""

But as it seems e-cigarettes are here to stay, most calls are for informed regulation rather than prohibition. ""The majority of e-cigarettes -- especially when they are well regulated -- are likely to be less toxic than cigarettes -- and that for smokers is an advantage,"" says Peruga.",Are e-cigarettes fueling a new addiction?,4,CNN

Special to USA TODAY

Spring has barely sprung, but in most of the country, spring allergy season — triggered by the first stirrings of tree pollen — is well under way.

You can tell by the sniffles and sneezes of the afflicted. But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.

New this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi's Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.

Don't expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here's what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.

Believe (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.

These drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the ""single most effective drug class"" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. ""These are first-line treatments"" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.

But that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.

Possible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.

Expect to pay more.

When prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it's impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.

There's a right way to use these sprays.

They should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is ""to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,"" she says.

It's also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.

Antihistamines still have a role.

These drugs target histamine. That's a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses

Antihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn't want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It's a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.

Be careful with decongestants.

Decongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin — unlike the steroid nasal sprays — can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.

So use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.

Keep your medical providers in the loop.

Over-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care — especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what's causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.

Also important to remember: While medications can be helpful, the first rule of allergy control is to avoid the substances that make you sniffle and sneeze. If you are allergic to mold spores or to pollen from trees, grasses or ragweed, that means knowing when levels are high (by checking pollen.com or the National Allergy Bureau) and then taking steps such as these recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and & Immunology:

• Keep windows closed at home and in your car.

• Use air conditioning if possible.

• Try to stay indoors, and avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves.

• If you need to be outside for a long period, wear a pollen mask.

• After time outside, take a shower, shampoo your hair and change clothes.",,4,USA Today
story_reviews_00652,"Diseases like Alzheimer’s start years, even decades, before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up. And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians—not neurology experts—will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available.

“If we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer’s disease, that would help,” says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, “but we don’t.” But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal Neurology, his Alzheimer’s test has promise.

Petersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “What we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,” he says.

In the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients’ medical charts—their age, family history of Alzheimer’s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer’s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.

In the next phase they studied the results of the patient’s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer’s.

And another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease—how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. “We were a little surprised,” says Petersen. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes — a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues — should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer’s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.

Currently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer’s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen.

MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer’s 10 Years Before Diagnosis

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.

For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process. But they can direct them toward clinical trials of promising new drugs to address Alzheimer’s dementia, which may slow the cognitive decline considerably.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, March 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A new study calls into question the value of removing blood clots from a patient's heart arteries during angioplasty, a procedure to open blocked arteries.

Although manually removing clots has become common medical practice, this study of more than 10,000 heart attack patients found no benefit in terms of reducing death, heart attack or heart failure in the six months after the procedure. Removing clots appears to have increased the risk of stroke in the month after clots were removed, the Canadian researchers report.

""There has been some controversy about removing blood clots during the treatment of heart attacks,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjit Jolly, an associate professor of cardiology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

A study in 2008 suggested that removing clots during an angioplasty might save lives, he said. ""Guidelines changed based on this study,"" Jolly noted. Another trial in 2013, however, suggested that removing clots was not beneficial, he added.

In this latest trial, researchers found that routinely removing clots was not beneficial, Jolly said.

Jolly isn't sure why removing clots causes additional problems. It is possible that parts of the clot break off and travel elsewhere in the heart or brain, he said.

""This is an unexpected finding, and we want to confirm this in other studies,"" Jolly said.

Jolly said there are mechanical methods of removing clots, which were not tested in this study. Whether these methods would have produced better results isn't clear. ""The jury is out on that. It needs to be tested in large trials,"" he said.

However, preliminary results from small trials of mechanical clot removal have not been promising, Jolly noted.

Jolly said the lesson from his team's trial is that clot removal should be used only as a rescue treatment when an angioplasty fails to clear an artery.

""As a routine therapy, clot removal is not beneficial and could have some significant downsides,"" he said.

The results of the study were published online March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with a planned presentation of the findings at the American College of Cardiology's annual meeting in San Diego.

For the study, Jolly and colleagues randomly assigned 10,732 patients undergoing an angioplasty after a heart attack to have clots manually removed or to not have them removed.

Among all the patients, 6.9 percent who had clots removed, and 7 percent of those who didn't, died, had another heart attack or developed heart failure in the 180 days after the procedure.

In the 30 days after the procedure, 0.7 percent of the patients who had clots removed suffered a stroke, as did 0.3 percent of those who only had angioplasty, Jolly's team found.

Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, ""This is a very important and eagerly awaited clinical trial.""

A number of studies have suggested a benefit from manually removing clots during an angioplasty, but this trial found no clinical benefits for doing so, he said.

""These findings will likely have important implications for clinical practice,"" Fonarow said.

The Ache: In cold and flu season, pathogens spread when people are crammed into close quarters, such as airplanes and cars.

The Claim: Personal air purifiers worn around the neck clean the air in the wearer’s breathing zone of viruses and bacteria as well as allergens, say companies that sell them.

The Verdict: The devices helped clear a variety of test particles from the air in lab tests, but scientists say there’s no proof they have any health benefit in real conditions.

“It sounds like it worked in a laboratory setting, but that doesn’t say anything about whether it works in real life,” says Darryl C. Zeldin, scientific director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. Theoretically it is possible that the devices might help reduce transmission of pathogens, or ease asthma symptoms, but proof is needed, he adds.

Personal air purifiers work by emitting electrically charged molecules or atoms called ions, companies say. The ions transfer the charge to particles—such as one carrying a flu virus—in the user’s breathing zone and since like-charged particles repel each other, they are pushed out of the breathing zone, companies say.

The AirSupply Minimate from Wein Products Inc. in Los Angeles, emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. The AirTamer A310, new last year from Headwaters Inc. in Marblehead, Mass., emits negative ions. It recharges through a USB port and holds the charge for 150 hours of continuous use, says company co-founder Troy Anderson. Both devices have suggested prices of $150.

In lab tests funded by Headwaters, the AirTamer was found to efficiently clear cigarette smoke, Mr. Anderson says.

In research partly funded by the company, Wein’s technology has undergone a battery of testing by University of Cincinnati scientists. In a study, published in the journal Indoor Air in 2005, a prototype of the Minimate was tested for removal of particles, including salt particles in a variety of sizes and a bacterium that doesn’t usually cause disease. It cleared the air of half of the test particles after 15 minutes, and nearly all of them within 90 minutes, according to the results.

The particles remain present on surfaces, “but at least you reduce inhalation exposure,” says study author Sergey A. Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the university. Since the particles used in the test were similar to the size of bacteria and particles carrying infectious viruses, it wasn’t necessary to use infectious particles in the test, he adds.

Dr. Grinshpun’s study appears nicely done, but doesn’t reflect real-life conditions, says Werner E. Bischoff, an infectious-disease specialist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. In the lab tests, the particles are introduced only once and the purifier is given time to clear them, he adds, but “if you sit next to a person in an airplane, this person will sneeze and cough during the entire eight-hour flight.”

Colds and flus are transmitted not just by air, but also by people touching surfaces, Dr. Bischoff adds. It’s always a good idea to avoid touching your nose or mouth after touching the back of an airline seat.

The Cincinnati researchers also found the Minimate prototype reduced the concentration of “viable” airborne bacteria, defined as bacteria that grow well on a petri dish, Dr. Grinshpun says. It isn’t known exactly what causes the inactivation of bacteria, he says.

Headwaters’s Mr. Anderson and Stanley Weinberg, CEO and chairman of Wein, both say that while it’s difficult to test the devices for real-world benefits, customer feedback has been positive.

Scientists caution that the antibacterial effect could be caused by a gaseous byproduct of the device, such as ozone, an air pollutant. Both Messrs. Anderson and Weinberg say their devices produce negligible amounts of ozone. Mr. Weinberg adds that the Minimate has also tested negative for hydrogen-peroxide emission.

In 2006, a personal air purifier exploded on a Continental Airlines flight, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. According to the report, the problem was probably caused by the user recharging a non-rechargeable battery; there were no serious injuries. The device, called the Fresh Air Buddy and formerly manufactured by Wein for another company, is no longer made, says Mr. Weinberg.

Whether you’re allowed to take an air purifier on an airplane depends on the carrier. United Airlines, which now owns Continental, doesn’t allow the air purifiers in the cabin based on the results of an “internal review,” a spokeswoman says. There is no Federal Aviation Administration restriction on carrying personal air purifiers on board, but each airline can make its own call, an FAA spokeswoman says.

story_reviews_00657,"Still, the findings could help smooth the way for regulatory approval, wider use of the drugs by doctors and possibly reimbursement by insurers.

The drugs, evolocumab from Amgen and alirocumab from Sanofi and Regeneron, inhibit a protein in the body called PCSK9 that helps regulate cholesterol. In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. In many cases such big reductions were achieved even though the patients were already taking statins.

Both drugs could win approval from the Food and Drug Administration by this summer. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. (However, the PCSK9 drugs are taken by injection every two weeks or four weeks, which could deter some users.)

Statins reduce cardiovascular risk and scientists believe it is because they decrease low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. The drug niacin did not protect against heart attacks and strokes even though it raised so-called good cholesterol and modestly lowered bad cholesterol.

Insurers in particular might demand proof that the PCSK9 drugs stave off heart attacks, strokes, deaths from coronary disease and procedures to open arteries before agreeing to pay for them for many patients. Executives at CVS Health, a leading pharmacy benefits manager, recently said that PCSK9 inhibitors might cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year and would strain health care budgets because so many people might use them.

“Managed care pharmacy, indeed the health care system, has never seen a challenge like this to our resilience in absorbing costs,” they wrote in the Health Affairs blog.

Whether the results from these two small studies will be persuasive enough remains to be seen.

The study of Amgen’s evolocumab involved 4,465 patients with various degrees of risk, two-thirds of whom were randomly chosen to get the drug in addition to the medication they were already taking. After one year, 0.95 percent of those in the group that received the drug had suffered a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problem, compared with 2.18 percent in the group that did not take the drug. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.",Tests of Cholesterol Drugs Offer Hope of Reducing Heart Attacks and Strokes,5,New York Times

Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.

An easy, two-minute vision test administered on the sidelines after a young athlete has hit his or her head can help to reliably determine whether the athlete has sustained a concussion, according to a new study of student athletes, some as young as 5.

The test is so simple and inexpensive that any coach or parent potentially could administer it, the study’s authors believe, and any league afford to provide it as a way to help evaluate and safeguard players.

Those of us who coach or care for young athletes know by now that an athlete who falls or collides with something during play or seems dazed, dizzy, loses consciousness or complains of head pain should be tested for a concussion, which occurs when the brain is physically jostled within the skull.

But most of us are clueless about how to test young athletes. The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.

But while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.

That situation prompted researchers at New York University’s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.

Their thoughts soon turned to vision.

“About 50 percent of the brain’s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,” said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.

Eye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone’s brain is working.

But for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.

However, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.

The test requires no medical training.

But it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.

They recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.

These athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.

Then they went out to play.

During their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.

Neurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.

Then the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.

The Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study’s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).

The King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.

The pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.

Overall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.

The upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches “should absolutely consider” familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.

If an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.

It is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.

How to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test

During preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.

During the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.

Interestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.

story_reviews_00660,"(CNN) By the time Cynthia Falardeau read about Alex Pring, a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer, she had made peace with her son Wyatt's limb difference.

Her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands. At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.

Wyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.

""His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,"" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.

So when a friend shared a story from the ""Today Show"" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.

""He doesn't need this,"" she thought.

Her fifth-grader had a different reaction: ""I want one of these robot arms!"" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. ""I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!""

There were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.

Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.

The UCF team, which operates a nonprofit called Limbitless Solutions , is special because it's the only group in the 3-D volunteer network making electronic arms. Most 3-D arms are mechanical, which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep.

""It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?"" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. ""It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.

The UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.

""My mother taught us that we're supposed to help change the world,"" Manero said at the time. ""We're supposed to help make it better.""

The students were blown away by what happened after that. The ""Today Show"" and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero, and then they got international attention. Families in more than 25 countries have asked the UCF students to help their children. In February, Microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world.

Each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.

Petresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.

""He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,"" he said. ""I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.""

Eventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.

Petresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can ""not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.""

As they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's ""Frozen,"" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from ""Blue Man Group."" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from ""Transformers.""

""We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,"" Petresky said. ""There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.""

The team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.

He expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.

His mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.

""The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.""

As they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.",College kids make robotic arms for children without real ones,2,CNN
story_reviews_00661,"Colorectal cancers kill more Americans than any other cancer except lung cancer, but a new study suggests you can reduce your risk of the disease by laying off the cheeseburgers and pastramis and opting for a large salad or broiled salmon instead.

After tracking 77,659 Americans and Canadians for an average of more than seven years, researchers from Loma Linda University found that vegetarians were 22% less likely than meat-eaters to be diagnosed with colon cancer or rectal cancer. The results were published Monday by JAMA Internal Medicine.

The study volunteers were all members of the Seventh Day Adventist church, which strongly encourages a vegetarian diet. (The church also urges followers to exercise regularly and refrain from smoking, drinking or using mind-altering substances.)

As a result, the researchers didn’t just compare vegetarians to non-vegetarians. They were also able to assess the relative merits of different types of vegetarian diets. Here’s how they stacked up:

Advertisement

By far, the lowest incidence of colorectal cancers was seen in pesco-vegetarians, people who eat fish at least once a month but eschew all other types of meat. Compared to omnivores, pesco-vegetarians were 43% less likely to be diagnosed with these cancers during the course of the study.

Lacto-ovo vegetarians (who eat eggs and dairy foods but not fish or other meats) came in second, with an 18% reduced incidence of colorectal cancer. They were followed closely by vegans (who don’t eat eggs, dairy products or any kind of meat), who were 16% less likely to get a colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Even semi-vegetarians (who ate meat at least once per month but no more than once per week) were 8% less likely to get colorectal cancer during the study period than never-vegetarians, the researchers found.

All of these risk-reduction calculations were adjusted to account for age, gender, race, education level, daily calorie intake, exercise habits, smoking and drinking behavior, family history of colorectal cancer, and other medical conditions.

The researchers also crunched the numbers separately for colon cancer and rectal cancer. In this analysis, being a vegetarian (of any type) reduced the risk of colon cancer more than rectal cancer.

Previous studies have found that eating red meat – especially processed meat – is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and eating fiber is known to reduce the risk. So it’s not exactly surprising that vegetarians fared better than meat-eaters in this study.

But some of the details remain mysterious. For instance, the vegetarians in this study ate fewer foods with refined grains, added fats and sugar than their non-vegetarian counterparts. The study authors even said it will take more research to determine whether the pesco-vegetarians were better off because they ate fish.

story_reviews_00662,"GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN (Reuters) - A wearable device that stimulates the sense of balance with electric “noise” could help Parkinson’s disease patients, according to Swedish scientists.

Scientists from the University of Gothenburg’s Sahlgrenska Academy have developed a portable pocket-sized vestibular, or balance, stimulation device in a bid to improve the lives of Parkinson’s sufferers.

The research was led by Associate Professor Filip Bergquist, who said the simple device was similar to the TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy which is used for pain relief, for example in child birth.

“So this is really not a very complicated device. It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what’s called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything,” Bergquist explained.

The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located.

Parkinson’s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness.

Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson’s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia.

In earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals’ motor skills and balance.

The researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson’s patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients’ balance and the combined symptoms.

Parkinson’s sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier.

“I have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated,” he said.

Unfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom’s balance problems.

Bergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough.

He also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment.

“What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson’s disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said.

The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home. If those trials prove successful, the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years.",Electric 'noise' treats Parkinson's symptoms,3,Reuters
story_reviews_00663,"The Gentle Cesarean: More Like A Birth Than An Operation

There are many reasons women need cesareans. Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. But often the problem is that labor simply isn't progressing. That was the case for Valerie Echo Duckett, 35, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. After receiving an epidural for pain, Duckett's contractions stopped. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. Duckett says she has vague memories of being wheeled into the operating room, strapped down and shaking from cold.

""They were covering me up with warm blankets,""she says. ""I kind of slept in and out of it."" Her only memory of meeting her newborn son for the first time was from some pictures her husband took.

I felt that I hadn't earned the right to say I gave birth to him.

This is the experience many women have. The cesarean section is the most common surgery in America — about 1 in 3 babies is delivered this way. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. Duckett says she felt like she missed out on a pivotal moment in her pregnancy.

""It took me a long time even to be able to say that I gave birth to Avery,"" she says. ""I felt like I didn't earn the right to say I gave birth to him, like it was taken from me somehow, like I hadn't done what I was supposed to do.""

Duckett's reaction to her C-section is unfortunately a common one, says Betsey Snow, head of Family and Child Services at Anne Arundel Medical Center, a community hospital in Annapolis, Md.

""I hear a lot of moms say, 'I'm disappointed I had to have a C-section.' A lot of women felt like they failed because they couldn't do a vaginal delivery,"" says Snow.

Now some hospitals are offering small but significant changes to the procedure to make it seem more like a birth than major surgery.

In a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the sterile operating field. Mothers don't see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care — a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.

""I clicked on the link and thought, 'I want that,' "" she says.

The techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother's chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he'd allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.

When Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn't be that difficult to do. ""I didn't see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,"" he says. ""It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn't try that.""

It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest.

Family-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.

And there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother's chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother's chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother's hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.

At the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti's husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti's chest.

""It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,"" Caminiti says. ""He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.""

And the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.

Changes like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women's, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.

Camann says the gentle C-section is not a replacement for a vaginal birth; it's just a way to improve the surgical experience. ""No one is trying to advocate for C-sections. We really don't want to increase the cesarean rate, we just want to make it better for those who have to have it,"" he says.

So why has the procedure been slow to catch on? Hospitals aren't charging more for it — so cost doesn't seem to be a major factor. What's lacking are clinical studies. Without hard scientific data on outcomes and other concerns like infection control, many hospitals may be wary of changing their routines. Betsey Snow of Anne Arundel Medical Center says the family-centered C-section represents a cultural shift, and her hospital is helping break new ground by adopting it.

""It is the first time we have really done anything innovative or creative with changing the C-section procedure in years,"" she says.

Kristen Caminiti says her hope is that these innovations become routine. She says she'd like nothing more than to know that other women having C-sections are able to have the same amazing experience she had.",The Gentle Cesarean: More Like A Birth Than An Operation,4,NPR

Some people — who are they? — have no problem fitting regular aerobic exercise into their lives. The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. Now we have some answers: You may want to go just a tad longer and harder than you'd thought.

Current government guidelines advise adults to get the equivalent of at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of higher-intensity exercise every week, plus some strength training. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time.

To find out if that's true, researchers at Queen's University in Ontario studied different combinations of exercise intensity and duration in a group of 300 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity. (That's generally defined as a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women who aren't pregnant and more than 40 inches for men.) People with abdominal obesity are at higher risk of heart disease and early death than people with slimmer waistlines.

All the exercisers were told to work out under supervision five times per week for 24 weeks. One group worked out at low intensity, about 50 percent of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness), for about 31 minutes per session — enough to burn 180 calories for women and 300 for men. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. The intensity was about equivalent to walking slowly, said study author Robert Ross, a kinesiologist at Queen's University.

Another group exercised at the same low intensity but almost twice as long — about 58 minutes on average, or five hours a week, until the women had burned 360 calories and the men 600.

And a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO 2 max, until they'd burned the same number of calories as the second group. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots. (Note that we're not talking about the all-out sprints of high-intensity interval training.)

A fourth group was told to do no exercise.

All the participants were told to keep a food diary and to eat a healthful diet but to keep their calorie intake constant. They also wore accelerometers to track their physical activity during the rest of the day, to make sure the more intense exercisers weren't compensating with more time on the sofa.

At the end of the study, members of all three exercise groups lost an average of about 2 inches from their waist circumference. There weren't differences between the three groups. The average exerciser also lost 5 to 6 percent of body weight.

""The take-home message here is that if you're consuming a healthful diet and engaging with exercise consistent with the guidelines, you're going to see a benefit in your waistline and on the bathroom scale,"" said Ross. The results were published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.

But there was also a benefit from going just a bit faster: Only participants in the higher-intensity group saw an improvement in glucose tolerance, a risk factor for heart disease. (It's unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.)

The result makes sense, since there's some previous evidence suggesting that higher-intensity exercise is tied to improving how the body processes sugar, said Neal Pire, an exercise physiologist who puts together medically based training programs at HNH Fitness in Oradell, N.J., a program of Holy Name Medical Center. Strength training can also improve glucose tolerance, which is why it's part of the government guidelines, he told Shots.

Cardiovascular fitness also improved in all three groups, but the lower-intensity exercisers who went longer did better than those who went shorter, and the higher-intensity group did better still.

Bottom line: All the exercisers improved, but the folks who did the best walked briskly for about 40 minutes five times a week. (Ross suggests you walk as if you're late for a bus.) ""It doesn't take a lot,"" said Ross. ""That's why our participants were so surprised. They didn't have to climb Mount Everest.""",Walk A Little Faster To Get The Most Out of Your Exercise Time,4,NPR
story_reviews_00665,"New research leaves little doubt about it: Fitness is powerful. A new study shows it’s also a powerful predictor of whether an individual will live or die in the next decade.

Put a person on a standard-issue treadmill, crank up the speed and the incline, measure the maximum metabolic equivalents of task she achieves and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate she can endure, and you have two key bases on which to predict a patient’s 10-year survival prospects, says a study published Monday in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

The resulting “FIT Treadmill score,” say researchers from Johns Hopkins University, “is easily attainable from any standardized exercise test and translates basic treadmill performance measures into a fitness-related mortality risk score.”

The predictor also takes into account a patient’s age and sex. Once computed, the FIT Treadmill score was not improved by taking into account a wide range of measures often used to assess risk, including blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol readings, family history, medication use and the Framingham Risk Score.

The study plumbed the records of 58,020 patients in the Detroit area who were referred for a stress test because they reported chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or dizziness, among other things. Researchers checked the medical records for a median of 10 years after each stress test to see if a death -- of any cause -- was recorded. A total of 6,456 of these patients, who ranged in age from 18 to 96, died.

Looking back at the treadmill performance of those who lived and those who died, the researchers generated a scale ranging from -200 to 200 to convey an individual’s likelihood of dying of any cause over the next 10 years.

“The notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new, but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age, gender and fitness level, and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test,” says lead investigator Dr. Haitham Ahmed, a cardiology fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Patients with a score between 100 and 200 have a 98% likelihood of surviving the next decade, the researchers said. Those with scores between 0 and 100 have a 97% probability of survival. Patients who turn in a performance yielding a score between 0 and -100 have an 89% likelihood of 10-year survival. And those with a score between -100 and -200 have a 62% probability of surviving.

Probabilities may not grab all patients by the collar. But telling someone he or she has a better than 1-in-3 chance of dying before the next decade’s out (or even a better than 1-in-10 chance) would probably be a sobering reminder to hit the gym. The authors said the metric “can be used to communicate fitness-related risk and motivate behavioral change after exercise stress testing.”

Do-it-yourself stress testing is probably not very reliable, since a physician or sports physiologist needs to be around to decide when to call a halt to the test (and therefore what maximum a test-taker has achieved).

But if you think you’d like to try, and can do a relatively simple computation, you can use the metabolic equivalents (METS) and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (%MPHR), which are both available on most cardio machines at the gym, to calculate your own survival prospects. Here’s the magic formula:

FIT Treadmill Score = %MPHR + 12 (METS) - 4 (age) + 43 (if female)

story_reviews_00666,"Going for a jog on a treadmill can predict how long you’re going to live, a large new study suggests.

Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine looked at standard treadmill stress test results for more than 58,000 subjects, ages 18 to 96. After age and sex, the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test.

Metabolism was calculated using ""metabolic equivalent of tasks"" or METs, a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task. The higher MET level achieved, the more likely it was the subject would last another decade.

The closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran, the less likely they were to die within ten years, compared to someone who only reached about 85 percent of their maximum heart rate during the test. Maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subject’s age from 220, a formula that’s been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike.

Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News medical contributor, explained the science behind the test on ""Good Morning America.""

“In medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state,” she said. “What’s new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one 50-year-old woman against another 50-year-old woman.”

Rather than being viewed as morbid, experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior, Ashton said. Everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do, she added.

story_reviews_00667,"Ten-year-old Alexis Carey has a rare but intractable form of epilepsy, Dravet Syndrome. The genetic disease causes severe and multiple seizures, which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal.

Her Boise, Idaho, family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children and wanted to see if it would help Alexis too.

""Parent to parent, when you're in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success, that's no longer anecdotal,"" Clare Carey, her mother, said. ""That's hope.""

But Idaho's stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use. The family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago. Now, they've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing, as Idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil.

Twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana. Virginia legalized the oil Feb. 26. In Utah, lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products, while still banning smoking.

Marijuana extract oil first received attention when a Colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had Dravet Syndrome. It is similar to hemp oil, which is legal in Idaho and can be bought in grocery stores.

With no known cure for Dravet Syndrome, children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures. However, the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child's developing liver, kidneys and other organs.

Proponents of cannabidiol oil, a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana, argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children.

Over time, Carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on.

""Like any parent, you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control,"" she said. ""Children die from Dravet by any one of the seizures. Alexis could have a seizure that may not stop, we never really know.""

Alexis began having seizures when she was two months old. But even in 2003, her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare, genetic disorder.

It wasn't until Alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was 2 that doctors determined she had Dravet Syndrome, Carey said.

Since then, Alexis' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures but the disease is tricky to manage. Dravet Syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type.

Alexis' seizures usually occur at night, which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns. During the day, Alexis requires constant supervision. While most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around, Alexis walks— albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs.

Carey says working with Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature has been easier than anticipated.

Lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea, she said.

This year, the bill is endorsed by Republicans Sen. Curt McKenzie and Rep. Tom Leortscher. Both are chairs of the legislature's State Affairs Committees, panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance.

The measure unanimously passed the Senate committee during its introduction hearing, which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee.

Yet the bill must survive a Statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose.",Young Girl's Story May Lead Idaho to Approve Marijuana Oil,2,Associated Press
story_reviews_00668,"Staying sexually active—and considering sexuality an important part of life—may be linked to higher cognitive functioning as people age, according to a study in the March issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.

Older men and women who were satisfied with their sexual relationships and considered sexuality an essential component of aging performed better on tests of cognitive function than those who felt sexuality and intimacy were unimportant, the research showed.

Previous studies have focused on the prevalence of sexual activity in older people. But the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasn’t known, researchers said.

The study, conducted in the Netherlands, involved 1,747 men and women from a larger study of aging. The subjects were 71 years old, on average. About three-quarters had partners. Researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory, mental processing speed, general cognitive function and fluid intelligence, or the ability to reason and think abstractly.

Subjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally, and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging. Chronic diseases, depression and medications were recorded.

A quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important, while 41% rated it as unimportant. Nearly 28% agreed that sexuality at an older age isn’t important anymore; 42% felt it was important.

Current sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by 32% and 6%, respectively, but 67% believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people, while 12% didn’t agree.

Subjects who didn’t see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy, and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant, had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity. The association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes, but seemed stronger in women, researchers said.

Caveat: The study didn't include subjects with severe cognitive impairment. Causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn’t be determined.

Running injuries: Regular shoe changes—and playing different sports—may reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners, suggests a study in the current issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.

Running involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations, which can lead to overuse injuries, researchers said. Alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load, the study suggests.

In 2012, researchers in Luxembourg recruited 264 recreational runners, 69 women and 195 men in their early 40s, for the 22-week study. More than half, 56%, alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models, on average, while 44% mostly wore the same pair.

The subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities, including the type of activity, duration, intensity, distance and shoe use. Pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded, along with the day the sport was resumed.

A third of participants reported at least one running-related injury during the study. Most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and 36% lasted up to a month or longer.

Runners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a 39% lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions, the adjusted results showed. Multiple shoe users wore the main pair 58% of the time during the study period, while other runners wore the same shoes 91% of the time.

Runners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week, about twice the amount of time spent by single-shoe runners, and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions.

Caveat: The study was relatively short, which may have limited the number of reported injuries, researchers said.

Can parallel use of different running shoes decrease running-related injury risk?

Response shift: People treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves, playing down the severity of their worst outbreak, a study found. This change in perception, called a response shift, could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease, according to a report in the March issue of Contact Dermatitis.

A response shift is particularly important in clinical studies, as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects, the study said. Taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients, researchers suggest.

Eczema affects an estimated 10.2% of U.S. adults, according to the National Eczema Association, a nonprofit research organization. Hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients’ quality of life, the study said.

Researchers in Denmark recruited 224 patients with hand eczema, 145 women and 79 men ages 18 to 70. Quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart. Subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extremely bad) at both time points.

Close to two-thirds, 61.2%, rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment, at 3.5, on average, compared with 4.7 on the first assessment, indicating an improvement, researchers said. Eczema was unchanged or worse in 38.8%. But 49.1% of subjects rated their worst-ever eczema outbreak at 8, on average, at the second assessment and 8.5 on the first, a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift, researchers said.

Caveat: The six-month follow-up period was relatively short, researchers said.

For years pregnant women have been warned about eating tuna because of concerns about mercury exposure. But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy.

Experts agree that seafood is a rich source of important nutrients, and that most of us don’t eat enough of it. Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, iodine, selenium and vitamin D. And numerous studies show that the nutrients in fish are particularly important for brain development in fetuses and nursing infants.

As part of a sweeping review of nutrition recommendations, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently reiterated the current seafood guidelines: Americans should eat a wide variety of seafood. The report also acknowledges the risk of mercury exposure from certain kinds of seafoods, and notes that women who are pregnant, nursing or may become pregnant should avoid certain kinds — tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel — because of their high mercury content.

The panel withheld a recommendation about tuna, second only to shrimp in popularity in the United States. Current guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency warn pregnant and nursing women to limit tuna consumption to six ounces per week.

The advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. In the report, the panel argues that albacore tuna is a “special case.” They noted that even when women ate double the recommended weekly amount of tuna, the benefits far outweighed the risks. “All evidence was in favor of net benefits for infant development and (cardiovascular disease) risk reduction,” the panel wrote.

The suggestion that pregnant women can eat more white albacore tuna — the type of tuna typically used in canned tuna — has upset advocacy groups that have called for increased warnings about mercury on tuna packaging.

“Tuna is responsible for nearly seven times more mercury exposure than the four high-mercury fish that the Federal Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women not to eat,” said Michael Bender, director of the mercury policy project, in a statement. “So why would the proposed 2015 dietary guidelines recommend that pregnant women eat more of it?”

But Dr. Steve Abrams, a panel member involved in the seafood recommendations and medical director of the Neonatal Nutrition Program at Baylor College of Medicine, said that while women need to be aware of the types of fish they are eating, the evidence is strong that fish consumption by mothers is good for the brains of their babies.

“The goal of the dietary guidelines is to give people a healthy way to eat and not to include or exclude certain foods,” said Dr. Abrams. “The benefit of having (omega-3 fatty acids) in your diet really exceeds the likely risk of contamination. The point is that you should have a variety of types of seafood and not limit yourself to one type, and variety includes canned tuna.”

Alice Lichtenstein, senior scientist and director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University said the panel hasn’t suggested that pregnant women eat more tuna. “The issue of fish contamination is a moving target and you need very current data,” said Dr. Lichtenstein. “It may be that the issue is re-evaluated and there is no change.”

Mercury levels in our oceans are on the rise due to an increase in industrial mercury emissions. Plants, plankton and tiny fish that have absorbed small amounts of mercury are eaten by larger fish. Over time, large fish sharks and swordfish accumulate high levels of mercury. As a result, health officials recommend fish like sardines, salmon, tilapia and trout that are lower on the food chain and have accumulated less mercury in their tissue.

The benefits of fish consumption on a developing fetus are clear. In a Harvard study of 135 mothers and infants, researchers tracked fish consumption during pregnancy and tested the mother’s hair to measure her mercury exposure. They found that for each weekly serving of fish the mother ate while pregnant, her baby’s score on visual recognition memory tests increased an average of four points. At the same time, a baby’s score dropped by 7.5 points for every one part per million increase in mercury found in the mother’s hair sample. The babies who scored highest on the memory tests were those whose mothers had consumed two or more servings of fish each week during their pregnancy, but were tested to have very low mercury levels.

Health officials have long worried about balancing warnings about mercury against the obvious benefits of consuming more fish. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. About one-third eat one serving of seafood weekly and nearly half of us eats very little seafood or none at all.

This fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and mercury exposure, noting the special concerns about canned tuna due to its popularity. Six ounces of canned tuna contains 60 micrograms of mercury compared to just 4 micrograms of mercury in a six-ounce serving of salmon, according to Consumer Reports. (A six-ounce serving of swordfish contains 170 micrograms, the magazine said. )

For people who want to safely eat more seafood, the magazine recommended shrimp, scallops, sardines, salmon, oysters, squid and tilapia as the lowest-mercury seafood. Also low are haddock, pollock, flounder and sole, Atlantic croaker, crawfish, catfish, trout, Atlantic mackerel, crab and mullet. In addition to the usual warnings about high mercury fish, Consumer Reports added marlin and orange roughy to the list. They suggested limiting consumption of grouper, Chilean sea bass, bluefish, halibut, black cod, Spanish mackerel and fresh tuna.

SUNDAY, March 1, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A procedure that delivers the anesthetic lidocaine (Xylocaine) directly to nerves in the back of the nasal cavity appears to offer significant relief to migraine sufferers, preliminary research indicates.

Early findings suggest that a single outpatient treatment can reduce migraine pain levels by about 35 percent for up to a month after the procedure, according to this small, ongoing study.

The technique is ""a minimally invasive treatment option,"" said the study's lead author Dr. Kenneth Mandato, a vascular and interventional radiologist at Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y. He added that he views the new procedure as ""a clear simple alternative"" to standard migraine treatments.

""This nasal spray option is safe, convenient and innovative,"" said Mandato.

In the new study, his team focused on 112 patients averaging about 45 years of age. All had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful (and cyclically occurring) headache known as cluster headaches.

Before participating in the study, patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from 1 to 10. Pre-treatment pain scores averaged more than 8, Mandato said.

The participants all underwent a session of ""image-guided therapy,"" in which a spaghetti-sized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion. This was then repeated in the opposite nostril, according to the researchers.

Mandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure.

The target nerve bundle, explained Mandato, ""resembles a complex highway crossing with many [nerve] signals and exits going in all directions."" And, he said, the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short-circuit that bundle's headache-causing pathway.

The day after the procedure, average migraine pain levels had dropped from about 8 to just over 4. Pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure, and reached an average of just over 5 by the one month post-procedure mark, according to the study.

The procedure didn't help everyone, though. Seven of the patients (about 6 percent) failed to get any benefit from the treatment, the investigators found. However, 88 percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure.

The researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated. Mandato said his team is continuing to monitor patients to see how well the nasal spray approach holds up six months out.

Dr. Richard Lipton, director of the Montefiore Headache Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very dramatic.""

""Unmet treatment needs in chronic migraine are huge, as is the overuse of medications,"" he noted. ""When a body gets used to having a chronic headache suppressor, the patient can experience a rebound in the absence of that suppressor. So developing an effective treatment that can reduce the need for acute medicine would be very valuable,"" Lipton explained.

""These results sound very promising,"" Lipton added. ""Of course, it remains to be seen if the demonstrated benefit already seen holds up over a longer period of time, and with a bigger group of patients.""

Mandato and colleagues are scheduled to present their findings Sunday at the Society of Interventional Radiology annual meeting in Atlanta. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The study received no funding from private industry.

There is no cure for the condition, but many ophthalmologists say reading glasses, contact lenses or even surgery can help correct your vision.

But now, a new app called GlassesOff claims it can help you see better without any glasses or magnifying devices.

Dr. Christopher Starr, a GlassesOff consultant and associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, says the app improves the brain’s visual cortex, which processes the images we see.

“It actually strengthens those connections in that part of the brain to help us better be able to identify [and] process a blurry image in front of our eyes,"" Starr told FoxNews.com.

The app works by using different game-like exercises to “train” the brain to interpret blurry images accurately.

Users are asked to finish three 12-minute sessions per week for three months.

Some gaming sessions ask users to identify fuzzy designs called ""Gabor patterns"" that flash on screen. And in other tests the app asks users to decide whether the letter ""E"" is facing up, down, right or left.

“Your eye is sending your brain a blurry image, but because your brain has gone through this training, it’s capable of processing much lower quality images,” Starr said.

The company says the app is scientifically tested. In a small study published in Nature's Scientific Reports, 90 percent of participants gained the ability to read comfortably without glasses.

But not all experts are sold on the app’s training method.

“The proposed theory of explanation behind the GlassesOff technology seems to imply that the resolution of the captured image of the eye and its more central processing by the brain can be improved upon, with ‘learning’. The idea that these low level changes can translate into higher visual performance that is clinically meaningful to a patient is yet to be demonstrated in any randomized clinical trial,” Dr. Barrett Katz, a neuro-opthamologist at New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, told FoxNews.com

The app is free to download, but the basic 3-month program costs $25. The company suggests following their “Ongoing Vision Care program” in order to keep the benefits indefinitely. For the life-long option, you can subscribe for $9.99 a month or pay $59.99 for the year.

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- After undergoing weight-loss surgery, women are significantly less prone to diabetes during pregnancy but twice as likely to deliver smaller-than-normal infants, a new study suggests.

Swedish scientists found that weight-loss (or ""bariatric"") surgery before pregnancy lowers the chances of certain complications for mothers and babies but raises the odds for others. They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.

""The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,"" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. ""Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,"" she added.

""The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,"" Johansson pointed out.

The study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

U.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.

Nearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.

Johansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn't had the surgery but had the same BMI.

Only 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.

However, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.

The investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.

""It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,"" she said. ""Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.""

Because obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine.

But Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.

""I don't think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,"" said Caughey. ""I don't think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.""

Caughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.

He also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.

""I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,"" Caughey said.

story_reviews_00673,"(Reuters Health) - Phone support can help ease postpartum depression, a small study suggests, offering an option for mothers who are unable or unwilling to seek therapy in person.

In the study, women with postpartum depression received telephone counseling from other women who had previously suffered from the disorder and recovered. The new moms found that the conversations helped relieve symptoms.

“Postpartum depression is a problem for one in seven women, and many of them don’t get help because there’s a stigma and they don’t have time and it’s expensive,” said study leader Dr. Nicole Letourneau, a professor and research chair in parent-infant mental health at the University of Calgary. “Training peer counselors to do phone counseling is an effective, low-cost and non-stigmatizing way for new moms to get the help they need.”

Particularly for first-time mothers, postpartum depression can be hard to distinguish from the stress and fatigue that come with caring for a new infant around the clock, Letourneau said. Symptoms can include sadness, insomnia, difficulty concentrating and making decisions, feelings of shame or guilt, as well as difficulty bonding with the baby or thoughts about harming the baby.

To assess the effectiveness of phone counseling for easing these symptoms, Letourneau and colleagues identified 64 mothers with symptoms of major depression within 24 months after delivery and offered them up to 12 weekly peer support calls.

The average mom with depression was about 26 years old. Most had symptoms of depression before they got pregnant, and many had previously been treated with medication or professional counseling.

The women who volunteered as peer counselors attended an eight-hour training course and received reference materials about postpartum depression. They also had nurses available for phone consults if they had concerns about anything the moms said during their conversations.

By midway through the study, 37 new moms had received at least one call from a peer counsellor. On average, the women spoke more than eight times and the calls typically lasted about 38 minutes, the researchers reported in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.

Over the second half of the study, 34 mothers had at least one phone conversation with a peer counsellor. On average, they spoke about three times.

Mothers who left the study said they no longer needed support, sought counseling from mental health professionals, or didn’t have time for the phone calls.

While all of the mothers were depressed at the start of the study, at mid-point only 32 percent were at risk for depression, and this declined to 15 percent at the end. Furthermore, at mid-point, 60 percent of the mothers had low depression scores; this percentage rose to 75 percent at end.

Even though the small study had several women drop out and lacked a control group of moms who received different treatment, the results are consistent with previous research that has proven peer counseling works, said Dr. Ruta Nonacs, a psychiatrist at the Center for Women’s Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

“It is a very powerful experience to be able to talk to a woman who has gone through the same thing and come out the other side,” said Nonacs, who wasn’t involved in the study. “A lot of first-time moms wonder what’s normal, what’s depression, and what to do with the fact that they feel overwhelmed and alone and like their experience looks nothing like the happy moms they see smiling in all of the baby food and diaper commercials.”

Because postpartum depression is the most common complication of childbirth, it makes sense to explore peer counseling and other interventions that can reach women in rural or suburban areas where access to mental health professionals may be limited, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the Center for Women’s Mood Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

“Most people in the world have access to a telephone,” said Meltzer-Brody, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This study, while small, suggests that peer phone counseling could be a very effective, widespread public health intervention.”

This practice isn't totally harmless. You should be consuming 600 international units daily if you're between the ages of 1 and 70, and 800 IU each day if you're 71 or older, according to the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academcy of Sciences. (For a chart with a little more detail, see here.) These amounts are enough for 97.5 percent of U.S. and Canadian residents, according to the IOM. (Sunlight stimulates production of vitamin D for people in sunnier climes.)

Go above 4,000 IUs, unless there's a specific reason that you need that amount, and you risk kidney stones, calcification of blood vessels and possibly the very cardiovascular disease you were seeking to prevent, Manson said in an interview.

So how did we get here? ""I think there's been a disconnect between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials to date,"" Manson said. Over the past 15 years, those studies ""have looked promising, and very often they've been reported by the media as suggesting that vitamin D has these benefits. I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better. I think it's important to understand that more is not necessarily better.""

Manson is leading the most extensive clinical trial of vitamin D use ever, an examination of 25,875 people across the United States to determine whether vitamin D is helpful against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, infection, autoimmune disorders and other conditions. The results are expected in late 2017 or early 2018.

In the meantime, how much vitamin D should you be consuming? The recommended dietary allowance works out to three or four servings each day of ""fortified"" foods such as milk, yogurt, soy beverages, orange juice or cereal, plus fatty fish twice a week, according to Manson's commentary.

She also called on physicians not to overscreen patients for vitamin D deficiencies, a practice that can lead to overprescribing it.

""Large trials of other widely used supplements have sometimes found benefits,"" Manson wrote, ""but in other cases--such as with high doses of beta carotene, vitamin E and selenium--have disproven some health claims for these supplements and identified health risks that may not have otherwise been detected.""

story_reviews_00675,"Here’s a bit of good news for folks who enjoy sitting in a super-heated room and sweating profusely: Finnish researchers say regular sauna bathing may help men to live longer.

The study, which was published Monday in JAMA, is the latest in a series of papers to explore the potential cardiovascular health benefits of “chilling out” in a room heated to 174-degrees Fahrenheit.

“Our results suggest that sauna bathing is a recommendable health habit,” wrote Dr. Jari Laukkanen, a cardiologist a the Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland.

The only catch is, nobody can explain exactly why this is the case.

Advertisement

“Further studies are warranted to establish the potential mechanism that links sauna bathing and cardiovascular health” wrote Laukkanen and his colleagues.

The researchers based their conclusion on a database of of 2,315 Finnish men who have had their health tracked since 1984. Study participants were all aged 42 to 60, with a median age of 53.

Those men who enjoyed a sauna two or three times a week had a 23% lower risk of experiencing a fatal episode of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease, compared to those who took just one sauna a week, according to researchers.

The apparent health benefits for men who used the sauna four to seven times a week was even greater: They had a 48% lower risk of similar incidents when compared to men who used the sauna only once a week, researchers said.

Advertisement

“The higher frequency of sauna bathing was related to considerable decreased risks of sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease, fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality,” the authors wrote.

The researchers said a similar health benefit was unlikely to be found in steam rooms and hot tubs, due to the unique conditions of Finnish saunas.

A traditional Finnish sauna has dry air (10% to 20% humidity) and a recommended temperature of 176 degrees to 212 degrees. Humidity is increased temporarily by throwing water on the hot rocks of the sauna heater, and most Finns are accustomed to using a sauna once a week.

On average, the men in the study used a sauna twice a week, at a temperature of about 174 degrees. The average time spent in the sauna was about 14 minutes, researchers say.

The super-heated conditions of a sauna provoke a variety of physical reactions.

Heart rate can climb to 100 or 150 beats per minute -- similar to low- or moderate-intensity exercise -- and sweat is secreted at a rate of about 2 pounds per hour.

High temperatures also causes the body to flow more blood to the skin and less to internal organs.

“Previous studies have suggested that sauna bathing might have some harmful effects, whereas our results indicated a protective effect,” the authors wrote.

Advertisement

The researchers noted that only 1% to 2% of sudden deaths occurred within 24 hours of sauna bathing. Alcohol intake was a major contributing factor in those cases, authors wrote.

In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, speculated on a number of possible reasons for the observed benefits.

“Although we do not know why the men who took saunas more frequently had greater longevity (whether it is the time spent in the hot room, the relaxation time, the leisure of a life that allows for more relaxation time, or the camaraderie of the sauna), clearly time spent in the sauna is time well spent,” Redberg wrote.

story_reviews_00676,"For those plagued with peanut allergies, protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin, a new study suggests.

Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images

In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.

It means that “they are not going to have to worry about traces of peanut in a package that came from a plant where peanuts were used or minor contamination of food in a restaurant,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Hugh Sampson, a professor of pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai.

That's a potentially life-saving development. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. About 15 million Americans have food allergies, including 1 in 13 children, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group. Eight foods account for 90 percent of all reactions: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish and shellfish.

Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

Unlabeled allergens are a leading cause of food recalls in the U.S. and the number of food allergy-related visits to hospitals are on the rise, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA recently warned people with peanut allergies to avoid foods containing ground cumin, after traces of peanut powder were found in the ground spice.

In the skin patch trial, the international team of researchers randomly assigned 221 volunteers, ages 6 to 55, to wear a placebo patch or a patch containing peanut protein at one of three doses: 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms or 250 micrograms.

At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11.

The skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.

“Many have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die,"" he said. ""So it’s tough to get them to take it. With this you just slap a little patch on their backs.”

Although some volunteers experienced redness and itchiness at the site of the patch, there were no serious side effects. Just two dropped out because of flare-ups of eczema.

“The goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life-threatening,” said Dr. Amy Stallings, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center who is not affiliated with the new study. “And the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer.”

The patch study's results are promising, although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year, Sampson said. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.

Researchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children — the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008, studies show — but there’s no clear answer.

MONDAY, Feb. 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Mindfulness meditation may help older adults get a better night's sleep, a small study suggests.

Researchers found that among 49 older adults with sleep problems, those who learned mindfulness practices started sleeping better within six weeks. In fact, they did better than their counterparts who were given conventional lessons on good sleep habits, the study authors said.

Experts said the findings, published online Feb. 16 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, are encouraging.

On average, the effects of the mindfulness program were comparable to what's been seen in studies of sleep medications and ""talk therapy,"" said study leader David Black, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.

According to Black, that means older adults can feel comfortable opting for ""mind-body"" practices as a way to address moderate sleep problems. But he also emphasized the structured nature of the program tested in his study.

""From our results, it is worth a try to engage in a structured mindfulness-based intervention led by a certified teacher with extensive experience,"" Black said.

In general, ""mindfulness"" practices encourage people to focus their attention on the present moment, instead of the past or future, and to take an objective look at their thoughts and emotions.

Sleep problems, Black explained, both affect and are affected by the mind. When people have difficulty sleeping, they often start to worry about it -- and that anxiety can worsen their sleep problems. On top of that, poor sleep itself can lead to psychological ""distress,"" such as depression symptoms, Black said.

""There is a cyclical pattern here between wakefulness, sleep disruption, worry and mood,"" he said.

By learning ""non-judgmental mindful awareness,"" Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a ""necessary prerequisite"" for sleep, Black noted.

For the current study, his team recruited 49 older adults with ""moderate"" sleep problems, based on their answers to a standard sleep-quality questionnaire. It asked a range of questions -- including whether the person had problems falling asleep or staying asleep, had difficulty breathing at night, or felt drowsy during the day.

Black's team randomly assigned the participants to six weekly sessions of either sleep ""hygiene"" education or mindfulness training.

The mindfulness group learned different meditation techniques, as well as how to eat and move with more attention. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep.

By the end of the study, the mindfulness group was showing a significant improvement -- shaving about three points, on average, from their scores on the sleep-problem scale. The group that received standard education lowered their scores by an average of 1 point.

The mindfulness group also showed greater improvements in depression symptoms and daytime fatigue, the investigators found.

Black said the benefits of mindfulness training were on par with what's been found in studies of sleep medications and cognitive behavioral therapy -- a form of ""talk therapy"" that is often helpful for insomnia, for example.

""Cognitive behavioral therapy is highly effective,"" said Adam Spira, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore.

The problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort.

""What I found most interesting about this [mindfulness] approach is that it's a non-drug option, and it's accessible to the community at large,"" said Spira, who wrote an editorial published with the study.

Classes in meditation are available in many communities, and there are books, websites and CDs where people can learn mindfulness techniques. (The course Black's team studied is available online, at http://marc.ucla.edu.)

The caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program. There is no guarantee that the course at your local senior center or a book would have the same chances of working.

Still, Spira said, it's a promising approach to older adults' sleep problems -- and one that's needed. ""We definitely need a whole menu of treatment options,"" he said.

One major reason is that sleeping pills, the most common current treatment, are temporary fixes at best. Plus, Spira said, they can have side effects that are particularly dangerous for older people -- such as dizziness and balance problems that can lead to falls, and problems with attention and memory.

Then there's the fact that sleep issues become common as people age, Spira said. Studies suggest that about half of adults age 55 and up have insomnia or some other sleep disturbance -- and that can have consequences for their physical and mental health.

There are still plenty of questions about the effects of mindfulness meditation on sleep quality. A key one is whether the benefits last.

Spira said that with cognitive behavioral therapy, there is evidence that people's sleep keeps improving after their therapy sessions have ended. ""It'll be interesting to see whether people can learn mindfulness techniques, then see durable effects,"" he said.

A man smokes a cigarette in Los Angeles, California, May 31, 2012. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn

Smokers who took the pill, sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix elsewhere, were much more likely to quit after cutting back on cigarettes than smokers who didn’t use the drug, the study found.

“This allows us to reach a much broader population of smokers who aren’t willing to quit abruptly or set a quit date, and it shows that people can quit without going cold turkey,” said lead study author Dr. Jon Ebbert, a professor in primary care and internal medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “This is very strong support for changing clinical practice to include gradual reduction aided by medication.”

Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And tobacco kills one in 10 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

Quitting can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus and bladder. Ten years after quitting, the risk of lung cancer drops by half, according to the CDC.

To see if Chantix, which is manufactured by Pfizer, could help smokers quit without going cold turkey, Ebbert and colleagues randomly assigned 1,510 people at 61 centers in 10 countries to receive either the drug or a placebo for 24 weeks.

They asked study participants to reduce cigarette use by 50 percent by the fourth week, and by 75 percent by the eight week, with the goal of quitting by week 12.

By the last ten weeks of treatment, weeks 15 to 24, the group taking the pill had significantly higher abstinence rates than the group on placebo.

This held true even after treatment stopped. For weeks 21 through 52 of the study, 27 percent of the people who had previously taken the drug successfully avoided smoking, compared with less than 10 percent of those who received the placebo.

“This is the first study of its kind to enroll a group of smokers who are not traditionally enrolled in clinical trials because they are not ready to quit,” said Dr. Caryn Lerman, professor of psychiatry and deputy director of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

“It offers compelling evidence that gradual reduction should be considered to facilitate quitting,” she said.

But even though the approach helped some hard-to-reach smokers, the majority of them still failed to quit, noted Lerman, who wasn’t involved in the study. Other treatments, such as nicotine patches and gum, can also help some smokers cut back gradually, she said.

While the study shows that Chantix, which is known generically as varenicline, can be effective for some smokers, the group taking the pill also experienced more side effects such as nausea, abnormal dreams, insomnia, constipation, vomiting, and weight gain.

Previous research has linked Chantix to side effects including suicidal thoughts, erratic behavior and drowsiness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a black box warning - its most severe and restrictive warning - on the product in 2009, highlighting the drug’s adverse neuropsychological effects.

People with a history of major depressive or anxiety disorder, suicidal behavior, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or psychosis were excluded from the study, published in the American Medical Association’s journal JAMA.

story_reviews_00680,"“Sometimes serious addiction needs to be coaxed down the stairs one at a time, not thrown off the top floor,” said Dr. Abrams, who was not involved in the study.

The study was funded by Pfizer, the drug company that makes Chantix, a treatment that costs about $250 a month. Federal regulators require companies to conduct studies proving the effectiveness of such therapies, and monitor them closely. The practice is common for smoking cessation therapies, said Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, who was among the study’s authors. If such studies were funded by the government, which sustains a lot of academic research, taxpayers would bear the burden for what the company would eventually profit from, he said.

Still, some researchers not involved in the study said the topic required more work.

“The approach taken here is a very reasonable one that appears to have been successful,” said Gary A. Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the State University of New York at Buffalo. “But the findings from one study do not make a fact. We need more studies, funded by someone other than the company that makes the product.”

Smoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans a year. The smoking rate has declined substantially since the 1960s, but the pace of decline has slowed in recent years and health experts are trying to figure out how to get more smokers to quit.

About 1,500 patients at 61 clinics in the United States and abroad participated in the study. None were willing to quit immediately, but all said they wanted to smoke less and to quit for good within three months. They were randomly assigned to two groups. One got Chantix, the brand name of the drug varenicline, which is taken twice a day by mouth as a pill; the other group got a placebo.",Medicine Given Even Before Smokers Are Ready to Quit Is Found to Help Them,4,New York Times
story_reviews_00682,"Surgeons sometimes fly blind when operating on hard-to-reach anatomical parts or hard-to-see conditions. For visual references inside the brain or body, they often rely on images and scans taken before an operation.

A growing number of hospitals are equipping operating suites with magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanners and other technology that enables surgeons to scan a patient in real time, without having to move them from the operating table.

The resulting real-time 3D visuals—known as “intraoperative imaging”—help surgeons excise tumors and tissue with greater accuracy, reducing risks, such as nicked nerves from an errant knife, and the potential need for repeat surgery. The images also help surgeons spot bleeding, blood clots or other unexpected complications outside their field of vision.

Intraoperative imaging allows surgeons to perform “significantly better” than conventional surgery, says Sohail Mirza, medical director of the Center for Surgical Innovation and chairman of orthopedics at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system in Lebanon, N.H., affiliated with Dartmouth College’s medical school.

“We still need a surgeon’s training and judgment,” Dr. Mirza says, “but we can use three-dimensional deep imaging to get past the limitations of human error and hand-eye coordination.” Dartmouth-Hitchcock opened the $20 million center last year with financing from a National Institutes of Health grant and its own funds. MRI and CT scanners mounted on ceiling rails slide in and out of four sterile operating and procedure rooms.

The technology, first developed for use in complex brain surgeries, now is expanding for use in spinal cord surgery, biopsies and removal of tumors and lesions in the breast, lung, prostate, liver, pancreas and kidneys. Researchers are studying other ways the technology can help diagnose and treat cancer and other diseases.

The real-time scans can show surgeons whether tissue or organs have shifted during an operation, and where the border of a lesion ends and healthy tissue begins. In radiation treatment, doctors using the scans can see when a tumor shifts and pause to spare healthy tissue. The images can also provide better visualization of masses that are completely out of sight. Studies have found that in 40% of cases, brain surgeons will modify what they are doing based on an intraoperative MRI scan.

“This is precision medicine at its best, using an individual patient’s images to guide their procedure,” says Clare Tempany, co-director of the Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating Suite program (known as Amigo) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The program is part of the hospital’s federally-funded National Center for Image-Guided Therapy, which is researching the use of intraoperative imaging in a variety of procedures and treatments including its cost-effectiveness. Since Amigo opened in 2011, 700 patients have undergone surgery including lung biopsies and breast-conserving tumor removal.

The need for more accuracy is real. As many as 40% of women who have breast-conserving surgery known as lumpectomy followed by radiation need a second operation because positive cells remain. At Brigham and Women’s researchers are looking at how to improve surgeons’ ability to determine the exact margins of tumors using intraoperative MRI followed by chemical analysis to decrease the need for re-operations.

Dr. Mirza says in the past, during spine surgeries, if he became concerned about whether screws or implants were perfectly placed, he would close up an incision and wheel his patient two floors down for a scan. In some cases, he would bring the patient back to revise the surgery, or in other cases accept “slightly imperfect” results to avoid more cutting. Revisions, in addition to adding to the patient’s risks, use up costly operating room and staff time, he says.

Last fall, Jack Deliso, then 8, needed surgery to remove a painful mass wrapped around his lower spine that made it increasingly hard for him to walk. An initial biopsy to test for malignancy had been inconclusive. Dr. Mirza and a pediatric neurosurgeon, David Bauer, proposed cutting out the entire tumor in one procedure.

Jack’s parents, Michael and Lisa Deliso, were fearful that if nerves were damaged during surgery, his ability to walk as well as his bladder and bowel function could be impaired.

The technology was reassuring. “They explained to us that they were able to take the pictures with the MRI while they were operating to make sure they got everything, without having to damage nerves or disturb the tumor,” Mr. Deliso says.

Jack says he was calm going into surgery “because it just had to be done and there was no use being scared of it.” He was tired of lying awake at night, when he says he felt “excruciating pain.”

During the 12-hour procedure, surgeons could see only the back of Jack’s spine. Because they didn’t know if the tumor was malignant, they were determined to avoid cutting into it, which could spread potentially cancerous cells elsewhere in the body. As they drilled into bones to detach and remove the tumor, they used a CT scan of the spine to help navigate accurately and avoid removing bone that wasn’t directly involved.

Next, they performed an MRI to make sure the nerve roots were unscathed and they hadn’t missed any part of the mass. Toward the end of the procedure, they did a second CT scan, which showed there was enough bone left so Jack wouldn’t need reconstruction with rods, screws and bone grafts. They finished up and closed the incision.

Jack was in the hospital for three nights. A week later, pathology tests came back showing the tumor had been benign and the surgeons had gotten all of it. Now 9 years old, Jack says he would like to play soccer or football—and be an orthopedic surgeon when he grows up.

Intraoperative scanning is costly for hospitals. For example, Imris Inc. of Canada makes Visius Surgical Theatre systems found in 87 operating rooms world-wide including at Brigham and Women’s and at Dartmouth. Each system consists of a two- or three-room suite with MRI units costing from about $3 million to $7 million, and CT scanners ranging from about $1.5 million to $3.5 million.

Jay Miller, president and chief executive, says over 17,000 procedures have been performed to date with Imris systems.

Intraoperative imaging has its own risks, says Bernadette Henrichs, director of the nurse anesthesia program at Barnes-Jewish College and nurse anesthesia research and education at Washington University School of Medicine, both in St. Louis.

Because of the strong magnetic force used in MRI, ferrous metal objects and tools must be kept out of the operating room, along with pagers, cellphones, jewelry and hair pins. Anesthesia teams stay with patients during scans and use equipment such as aluminum oxygen tanks and instruments made from plastic, titanium and other materials compatible with MRI.

At Barnes-Jewish Hospital, OR teams get training before they can work with live MRI imaging. They do annual safety drills including emergency procedures in the event a patient has a cardiac arrest while undergoing a scan.

“These are exciting advances, but we have to be vigilant in making sure patients and health-care workers aren’t harmed and take necessary safety precautions,” Ms. Hendrichs says.","In Image-Guided Operating Suites, Surgeons See Real-Time MRI, CT Scans",3,Associated Press

Special to USA TODAY

The idea that alcohol might be good for our hearts and blood vessels is a popular one, right up there with the notion that chocolate is a health food.

But before you pour your next cocktail, beer or glass of wine, you should know this: the science suggesting a benefit has never been conclusive. And some experts believe the evidence is getting thinner all the time.

""In health as elsewhere, if something looks too good to be true, it should be treated with great caution,"" says an editorial published this week in the medical journal BMJ. Mike Daube, professor of health policy at Curtin University in Australia, writes that the once-touted benefits of moderate drinking ""are now evaporating.""

His editorial accompanies a British study that finds death rates among moderate drinkers and non-drinkers are not different enough to suggest any real health benefits for drinkers. The only possible exception: women over age 65.

Also, a recent Swedish study found that middle-aged people having more than two drinks a day – just above the moderate level for men — had a markedly increased stroke risk.

Studies will continue, and not everyone has given up the idea that moderate drinking — up to two drinks a day for men and one day for women — might have some cardiovascular benefits.

Here's what U.S. experts say you need to know for now:

• Any benefits are unclear. ""I cannot prove and I don't think anyone can prove that alcohol consumption can prevent anyone from dying or prevent heart attacks,"" says Kenneth Mukamal, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston. But he says some studies show moderate drinking can boost levels of ""good"" HDL cholesterol and a hormone key to blood sugar control. Some studies following moderate drinkers and non-drinkers for decades find lower death rates and fewer heart attacks and strokes in the drinkers, he says. But those studies do not prove alcohol is the reason for the differences. One theory, backed by the new British study: the results are skewed by the fact that some non-drinkers are former drinkers with health problems.

• The risks are real. For some people, even moderate drinking is clearly risky. Those include people taking blood-thinning medicines and those with uncontrolled high blood pressure, says Curtis Rimmerman, a cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic. Alcohol raises blood pressure and thins blood, he say. It's also a source of ""non-essential liquid calories,"" a big concern in an overweight nation, he says. And heavy drinking is not good for anyone: It has long been linked with stroke, heart failure and many non-cardiovascular hazards, including car crashes.

• Gender matters. Women are advised to drink less than men, partly because they tend to be smaller. But that's not the only reason, says Lori Mosca, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association. ""Our blood vessels have a different hormonal milieu,"" she says and women are more vulnerable to the anti-clotting effects of alcohol – something that could raise the risk of bleeding strokes. Another consideration: even light drinking is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, according the National Cancer Institute.

• Age matters too. There's no evidence drinking in your 20s or 30s has any health benefits. ""At those ages, any benefit we get from moderate drinking is only to the extent that someone who is moderately drinking is not heavily drinking,"" Mukamal says.

• There's probably nothing special about wine. ""About a decade ago, there was this myth that red wine was better than white wine and wine was better than beer and spirits,"" Mosca says. Studies have failed to prove any difference.

""I don't want to be a killjoy,"" Mosca says. ""But I would never recommend alcohol as a preventative intervention.""

""There may be some evidence that perhaps one glass with a meal is OK,"" says Demetrius Lopes, a neurological surgeon at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, and another spokesperson the heart association. ""But it's a slippery slope to saying 'OK, maybe two is better.' I do think people don't know the dangers.""

Alcohol guidelines:

No health agency or major medical group recommends drinking for health. But, if you do drink, groups including the American Heart Association and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend:

• No more than two drinks a day for men.

• No more than one drink a day for women (and none for pregnant women).

A drink is:

• 12 ounces of beer

• 5 ounces of wine

• 1.5 ounces of 80-proof spirits or 1 ounce of 100-proof spirits.",,2,Imaging studies
story_reviews_00684,"Every year, many U.S. women get the grim news that they have breast cancer. In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.

But what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer?

Such drugs already exist.

The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.

Other medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.

But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found “exceptionally low” rates of usage.

In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women’s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.

The “low uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,” says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “Many high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.” On the other hand, these drugs don’t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious — such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer — only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition

A bit about the drugs

Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.

And they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.

A 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.

Investigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.

Nelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is “confident” that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.

Kenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force’s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they “have not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.” One possible explanation, he says, is that “these drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.”

Not used enough?

Given that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.

For some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman’s chances of having breast cancer in a five-year period and over a lifetime.

But this is where it gets more complicated. While many experts agree that women at high risk should consider the medications, they do not agree on what Gail score should trigger that consideration.

The studies that served as the basis for the FDA approval of the drugs, along with recently released guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), set the threshold at a five-year Gail score of 1.67 percent.

The Preventive Services Task Force, however, recommended a threshold of 3 percent. At that point, the panel said, women “are likely to have more benefit than harm from using tamoxifen or raloxifene.”

ASCO’s lower cutoff worries some experts. “At the 1.67 percent high-risk threshold,” Georgetown’s Lin says, “every woman age 62 and older would be [considered] high-risk.” That might lead to a situation in which millions of women would be encouraged, unnecessarily,to consider this therapy, along with its potential harmful effects.

Starting a conversation

Kala Visvanathan, the lead author of the ASCO recommendations and a faculty member at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said the cutoffs provide only a rough estimate of risk.

It is important to realize, she adds, that “as the risk increases, the benefits tend to be greater. This is an evolving field, and our goal is to better discern who is at high and low risk of breast cancer and develop a greater range of prevention strategies.”

An individual risk analysis should prompt conversation between doctor and patient about the potential benefits and the risk of the therapy.

Both the ASCO and the task force guidelines recommend such a conversation. “The discussion should include the specific risks and benefits associated with each chemopreventive agent,” according to ASCO.

The task force similarly recommends that “clinicians engage in a shared, informed decision making” with women and said that clinicians “should offer to prescribe” these drugs. Many risk factors increase a woman’s chances of having side effects. These factors include older age, obesity, having a history of a blood clot, history of any cancer, immobility, history of certain autoimmune conditions, history of using estrogen or oral contraceptives and history of some form of heart disease.

Insured women with a high risk for breast cancer and a low risk for side effects who try this therapy will not incur out-of-pocket costs, because this treatment was included in the Affordable Care Act as mandated, no-charge preventive care.

So what should a woman do?

Most important, become familiar with your family history, know your risk factors and discuss them with your primary-care physician. Age and family history cannot be controlled, but lifestyle changes — including eating a healthful diet, exercising, not smoking and not overconsuming alcohol — are eminently doable and can reduce your risk. These basic tenets of leading a healthy lifestyle have been shown to be important factors in breast cancer prevention.

Visvanathan and her colleagues are hopeful that more women will be aware of this option.

“A discussion on the use of preventive agents needs to become part of routine care in women at high risk,” she says. “We should begin to implement preventive strategies based on what we already know.”

story_reviews_00685,"Thirty percent of Americans say they’re trying to reduce or eliminate gluten in their diets. But only about 1 percent of the population has an autoimmune response to gluten. Somewhere in that gap, a diet fad is thriving.

There are two groups of people who should definitely avoid gluten: those diagnosed with wheat allergies and those who have celiac disease. The latter is more common, affecting about 1 percent of the population. The former affects perhaps 0.1 percent of people and is more common in children, who often grow out of it.

What is less clear is whether there is another group of individuals whose digestive systems have some “gluten sensitivity” and who would, therefore, benefit from avoiding gluten. The people who think they’re sensitive to gluten are filling the gap between those who should avoid gluten and those who are doing it anyway. But how many people really are sensitive?

Gluten, for those of you who have not kept up with dietary fads, is a component of wheat. You eat it in bread, pasta, pizza and so on. Gluten-avoiders are helped by an increasing array of gluten-free breads, pastas and other products. Entire aisles of Whole Foods Market stores appear to be devoted to this trend.

Despite the growing availability of alternative products, avoiding gluten can be a challenge. The satisfying, slightly chewy texture of bread requires gluten. For those of us who care about our health but, let’s face it, like a nice baguette, it seems worth asking: Is there any actual health benefit to gluten avoidance?

The earliest report on whether gluten could muck with some digestive tracts comes from the late 1970s. Two authors reported on a woman in her early 40s who was experiencing significant “gastrointestinal distress” (bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, etc.) and did not have celiac disease or a wheat allergy. After being put on a gluten-free diet, she improved immediately. When gluten was reintroduced to her diet as a test, the symptoms returned, only to disappear when the gluten was again removed. The authors diagnosed the woman with what they termed “non-celiac gluten sensitivity” (NCGS).

Gluten sensitivity fell off the radar for many years, but researchers have returned to it and adopted the same term. In contrast to celiac disease or a wheat allergy, NCGS is not diagnosed through direct testing. Rather, it refers to a condition in which someone experiences some problematic gastrointestinal symptoms that resolve when gluten is avoided. Gastrointestinal symptoms are the hallmark of NCGS — although some people also complain of fatigue or a foggy head.

Of course, it’s difficult to distinguish between someone who is sensitive to gluten and someone who is sensitive to the placebo effect. Since there is no test for gluten sensitivity, “diagnoses” are based on whether people say they feel better when they avoid gluten. But the mind is a powerful thing. If you think avoiding gluten will make you feel better, there is a reasonable chance that it will — even if gluten is irrelevant.

This effect makes it hard to test for gluten sensitivities even in a randomized controlled trial. If a researcher enrolls people in a standard randomized controlled trial and has some participants eat bread and some not, those who avoid bread may feel better simply because they think they should. The placebo effect may lead a researcher to falsely conclude that avoiding bread is beneficial.

But that’s not enough. To really get a sense of whether gluten sensitivity is a thing, researchers need to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which one group eats gluten, another does not, and no one knows which group they are in. That means putting everyone on a gluten-free diet and then directly supplementing some people with gluten protein and others with something that seems similar but has no gluten.

There have been two small studies like this. They were run by the same team. And, unfortunately for our ability to draw conclusions, they find different results. The first of these, published in 2011, followed 34 people for up to six weeks. The study population was made up of people who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with NCGS.

Everyone participating in the study was on a gluten-free diet. Half had their diet supplemented with a regular muffin and regular bread; the other half received a gluten-free muffin and gluten-free bread. The authors found that 40 percent of patients on the entirely gluten-free diet reported a continuation of symptoms, compared with 68 percent of those who had consumed gluten. The groups also differed on such measures as “satisfaction with stool consistency,” a phrase that I honestly never thought I would write.

The second study, published in 2013, had a similar set up — 37 people complaining of gastrointestinal problems, randomized into high-gluten, low-gluten and no-gluten groups. This time, rather than using bread and muffins, the authors used gluten and whey protein supplements. They found no difference in symptoms among the groups.

Why the results of these studies differ is unclear. One possibility is that some participants in the first study guessed which group they were in based on the muffin and bread and therefore the placebo effect became pronounced. Another possibility is simply that given how small the studies were, the differences occurred by chance. Regardless of the reason, we are left with little convincing evidence that gluten avoidance matters.

But let’s say you take heart in the first of these studies and now believe that avoiding gluten will make some people feel better even though they don’t have an allergy or celiac disease. How many people? Estimates of prevalence of NCGS are based, more or less, on information on gluten avoidance. In the 2009-10 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, about 0.6 percent of people without celiac disease or an allergy say their diet is gluten-free. And in a large Italian study of people who complain of gastrointestinal problems, the authors conclude that NCGS is slightly more common than celiac disease, putting it at a prevalence of a bit above 1 percent of the population.

For those of you keeping track at home, that means that while 30 percent of Americans are trying to cut gluten from their diet, probably at most only 1 percent of Americans may have NCGS.

If you don’t have celiac disease or a wheat allergy and are experiencing distressing gastrointestinal symptoms after eating gluten — lack of satisfaction with your stool consistency, for example — there is something like a 1 in 30 chance that the gluten is potentially responsible. If you cut out gluten and it makes you feel better, great. Although it may all be in your head.

If you are cutting out gluten for any other reason, all that will happen is you’ll feel the same, but without the pleasure of bread that tastes like bread.

CORRECTION (Feb. 12, 11:50 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly state that it is hard to test for gluten allergies. It’s hard to test for gluten sensitivities. The previous version also misstated the probability that gluten is responsible for gastrointestinal distress for those who experience gastrointestinal distress after consuming gluten and who don’t have celiac disease or a wheat allergy.

story_reviews_00686,"In most patients suffering a potentially devastating stroke triggered by a blood clot, retrieval of the clot with a medical device along with the standard drug therapy restored blood flow to the brain and reduced rates of death and disability, four new clinical trials have demonstrated.

The latest research confirms that, compared with patients who get clot-dissolving medicine alone, those who also get the treatment known as intra-arterial intervention are more likely to be discharged from the hospital, and to go home in better shape.

Intra-arterial stroke treatment uses either a suction or stenting device to capture and withdraw blood clots lodged in the vessels leading to the brain. The devices are already in use at some comprehensive stroke centers across the United States, and three designs are approved here.

But many centers, citing mixed findings on the devices’ benefits, have either abandoned or have been reluctant to offer the treatment, which is costly and complex to provide. Insurers also have been skeptical of the procedure’s value, and many refuse to pay for it.

The results of two of the clinical trials were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at an international conference on stroke in Nashville. Two more studies described at the meeting offered further confirmation of the clot-retrieval devices’ benefits.

The new studies were hailed by some as “game changers” in stroke care: UCLA stroke specialist Dr. Sidney Starkman said the presentations were greeted with standing ovations among neurologists and neurosurgeons at the conference.

At UCLA’s Stroke Center, Starkman said, “we’ve seen how well it works and have a team and a system that’s really ready” to provide intra-arterial stroke treatment. “We were enthusiastic all along and wanted to get others to do the same.”

The new research is expected to usher in more widespread use of clot-grabbing technologies at stroke centers across the nation. It comes just a year after a three widely cited studies — also published in the New England Journal of Medicine — failed to show benefits for stroke patients who got the additional therapy.

In the two large studies published Wednesday, researchers showed that more careful selection and speedy treatment of patients who got intra-arterial therapy yielded clearer evidence of the treatment’s benefits.

In both of the large clinical trials — one conducted in Canada, the United States, South Korea, Ireland and Britain, and the other in Australia and New Zealand — stroke patients needed to arrive at a participating hospital with a portion of their brain still undamaged by the lack of blood flow. Each of the hospitals performed extensive radiological scans to assess the extent of damage to the brain and locate and evaluate the size of the clot.

Treatment also had to come quickly. The use of alteplase, a clot-dissolving medication also known as tPA, is limited to otherwise healthy patients who arrive at a hospital within 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset. In the Australia/New Zealand study, treatment with a clot-retrieving device had to be initiated within six hours of the onset of stroke symptoms and completed within eight hours.

Compared with the 35 stroke patients who got clot-dissolving medicine alone, the 35 who got the two-pronged treatment were nearly twice as likely to regain some neurological function after three days. Imaging results revealed that for those who got both treatments, 100% of the brain tissue initially affected by a clot had blood flowing to it after 24 hours. Among the subjects who only got alteplase, the median level of restored blood flow was 37%.

In the other study, involving 238 stroke patients treated with alteplase, 90% of those who were also treated with an intra-arterial device were still alive 90 days later and 53% were considered functionally independent. Among the rest, 81% survived to 90 days and 29% were functionally independent.

Both clinical trials were ended early when it became clear that the dual therapy was superior to clot-dissolving medication alone.

“These are overwhelmingly, unequivocally positive numbers,” said Dr. J Mocco, director of cerebrovascular surgery for Mt. Sinai Health System in New York City. The studies suggest that, on average, for every 2.5 to 4 patients treated with intra-arterial therapy, one could be expected to have an outcome better than they would have had with alteplase alone.

“This is radically better than anything we’ve had,” said Mocco, who was not involved with either trial. The studies’ ethnically diverse patient population also means the findings are likely to be widely applicable.

At the same time, Mocco cautioned that few U.S. hospitals — including those with specialized stroke centers — were ready to offer intra-arterial stroke treatment.

“There are a great many centers that will report they have the capability to provide these services,” he said. “But there are truthfully relatively few that have put in the effort and expertise to create the comprehensive team-based work flow needed to rapidly evaluate and treat these patients safely and efficiently.”

In the United States, three clot-retrieval devices are approved for marketing. Two are designed to capture a clot in a mesh pouch: the Solitaire Flow Restoration stent retriever made by Covidien and the Trevo stent device made by Stryker Corp. The third is the Penumbra thromboaspiration device from Penumbra Inc., which suctions up a blood clot instead.

The Canada-led trial was funded in part by the University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. The Australia/New Zealand trial was paid for by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal Melbourne Hospital Foundation and the Heart Foundation of Australia. Both trials also received financial and infrastructure support from Covidien, the maker of one of the devices.

story_reviews_00687,"It’s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat, and it’s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten. Gluten is not a carbohydrate; it’s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives (including spelt, kamut and farro), as well as in barley and rye. It’s what gives bread its elasticity, but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease, damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms.

Even some people who don’t have celiac disease feel better when they don’t eat wheat. They may assume that they have gluten sensitivity, but some researchers believe that it’s not the gluten they’re sensitive to. Instead, it’s fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPS.

Never was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym. FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that don’t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, they pass through to the large intestine, where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment. The process by which FODMAPs are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress: diarrhea, bloating, pain, flatulence and constipation. Wheat and rye are high in FODMAPs, as are onions, garlic, apples, stone fruit, pistachios and many other foods.

Research by Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at Australia’s Monash University, has found that some people who believed they were gluten-sensitive were, instead, FODMAP-sensitive. A low-FODMAP diet eased their symptoms, as it does for about 70 percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive.

But there’s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. The fermentation that is painful to that 10 percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health. “Following strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,” says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.

If your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices — partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you’re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product’s label. Unless you have specific symptoms that a low-FODMAP diet alleviates, Gibson says, “enjoy your FODMAPs!”

story_reviews_00688,"An ancient herbal remedy is getting fresh attention this cold and flu season.

Some parents and even pediatricians believe elderberry extract or syrup can help kids stay healthy and lessen the symptoms when they do get sick.

The Brennan family in Glen Rock, New Jersey, believes it works..

""So we give the kids, and we take it ourselves, elderberry every morning right after breakfast,"" Kevin Brennan told CBS News.

He whips up a homemade concoction using frozen elderberries, blueberries and honey.

Some medical research suggests elderberry may reduce swelling in the mucous membranes to help relieve congestion. The Brennans' pediatrician, Dr. Lawrence Rosen, explains, ""Elderberry contains chemicals which are flavonoids which are anti-inflammatory agents.""

Raw elderberry is poisonous. istockphoto

One small study found an elderberry extract called Sambucol could shorten the duration of flu symptoms after a person gets sick by about 3 days. That would be similar to prescription antiviral medications like Tamiflu or Relenza, which have been proven effective in much larger studies and approved by the FDA to shorten the duration of the flu.

""There is not enough research about whether [elderberry] works in children and there is also isn't enough information about the proper dose in children,"" Dr. Anna Minta of Johns Hopkins Children's Center told CBS News.

Before you start popping elderberries, beware: eating them raw can make you sick.

The University of Maryland Medical Center says European elder, also called black elder, is the variety most often used for medicinal purposes. Raw or unripe elderberries, as well as other parts of the plant, contain a toxic compound related to cyanide. If the berries are not cooked thoroughly they can be poisonous.

But Kevin Brennan says, for his family, the natural alternative seems to be working. ""The duration and the severity of how they get sick is much less and they get healthy quicker,"" he said.",Can elderberry help treat colds and flu?,3,CBS News
story_reviews_00689,"(Reuters) - Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment.

Achillion’s shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor’s hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead’s and AbbVie Inc’s current therapies.

The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally.

The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options.

Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

AbbVie’s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks.

Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy.

The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy.

Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said.

The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair’s Katherine Xu said.

Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet.

The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.

Harvoni’s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.",Promising data bodes well for all-Achillion hep C treatment,2,Reuters
story_reviews_00690,"Two highly effective contraceptives—the intrauterine device (IUD) and the implant—actually last much longer than they are currently recommended, according to new research.

In a new study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers discovered that the hormonal IUD and the implant are highly effective a year after they are currently approved for use.

MORE: The IUD Answer: Why The Best Form of Birth Control is the One No One Uses

The researchers followed 237 women who were using an implant like Implanon and Nexplanon and 263 women using the Mirena hormonal IUD. The implants are currently approved for three years, and the hormonal IUD used in the study is approved for five. (There is also a non-hormonal IUD that is approved for 12 years, but it was not included in the current study.)

All the women were between the ages of 18 and 45 and their contraceptives were within six months of expiring before they enrolled in the study. The women were informed of the pregnancy risk associated with using their device longer than recommended, and the researchers called them for followup every 6 months for 36 months or until the women had their device removed.

By the end of the trial period, none of the women using the implant were pregnant and there was one pregnancy among the women using the IUD. Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%). The study is still ongoing, and the researchers plan to recruit up to 800 women and ultimately test whether the IUDs and implants were effective for up to three years after their current FDA-approved duration.

The benefit of being able to use the implant and IUD for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance. The longer use also makes the IUD and implant more convenient for women, since maintenance is reduced.

Though the data is preliminary, the researchers say they believe that the hormonal IUD and the implant can both be used for an additional year longer than the FDA recommends. That doesn’t mean you should extend your own use of the contraceptives without talking to your doctor. The study is still continuing, and it could be quite a long time before any changes to clinical recommendations are considered.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1 in 2 people may develop symptomatic knee osteoarthritis by the age of 85.

While there are several types of treatments to help, such as physical therapy, surgery and medications, there are still no guarantees.

Essie Jarrett, 54, of Brooklyn, N.Y., has undergone knee surgery nine times to treat her chronic knee pain.

“I had surgery, but the pain, it wasn't getting better, it was getting worse,” Jarrett told FoxNews.com. “And no matter what they tried on me, it didn't work. Nothing worked.”

Frustrated with living a life in pain, Jarrett turned to Dr. Halland Chen, a knee specialist in New York City, who offered a new non-surgical treatment known as the iovera system.

""The iovera works in a very novel fashion. It actually harnesses the power of focus cold therapy,” Chen told FoxNews.com.

The iovera treatment uses a handheld device with nitrous oxide canisters to freeze short needle probes to negative 126 degrees. Once injected into the skin, the cold therapy kills away targeted sensory nerves around the knee-- which prevents the nerve from sending pain signals.

""Within 15 to 25 minutes we've frozen away the nerve and the patient will know immediately if they have good results,"" Chen said.

Chen says he typically sees people with arthritis or those who have had total knee replacements and still struggle with residual pain. The iovera treatment is cleared by the FDA, and is designed to provide temporary pain relief for up to six months after a single session.

“The interesting thing that makes it very safe is one of the reasons why it doesn’t last forever— because you’re not permanently damaging or killing off the nerves, [the nerves] do regenerate and grow back over time,” Chen said.

Even though the procedure does not correct or cure a patient’s knee problem, Chen says it allows them to regain function and mobility so they can get through physical therapy and regain strength.

And as for the pain you might feel during the treatment, patient Charles Bradshaw, 39, said it didn’t hurt at all.

“No discomfort at all; it’s easier than getting a tattoo,” Bradshaw, who recently received the iovera treatment, told FoxNews.com.

For comfort, local anesthesia is applied to the area before treatment.

""It's been three months since I had the treatment, my knee is fine, [and] it doesn't hurt. And I do so much more--so much more. I go out a lot, I play with my grandkids. Everything that I had trouble doing before, I do it now,” Jarrett said.

Most insurance companies do not cover the procedure, and payment can cost around $1,000 per treatment.

story_reviews_00692,"Each year, five million people have wisdom teeth removed, but it's up in the air whether all of those surgeries were necessary.

Wisdom teeth, also called the third molars, are four teeth that grow at the very back of each corner of the mouth. For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.

But there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?

Simply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.

Dentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth

Dentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.

Many dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. ""Many people don’t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn’t justification of having them all removed,"" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.

In 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)

Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed

Some doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth

""You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life,"" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.

But a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can ""may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.

The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on

It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.

""Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything,"" White says. ""But I'd hope we can get past that.""

The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, ""There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process"" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.

The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth

There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.

There's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.

But inconvenience isn't the only risk. ""The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,"" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.

In some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.

The common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.

Americans spend billions each year on wisdom teeth

Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom teeth removed, according to the American Public Health Association. That's a hefty bill for something we may or may not need. How much it costs depends on how the molars are situated. A simple surgical extraction for a wisdom tooth that's showing through the gums should run about $230, according to Healthcare Bluebook. If it's impacted (pushed against another tooth and unable to fully come through the gum), the cost jumps to about $400 per tooth.

story_reviews_00693,"As a young girl, Rachel Brathen lived with crippling back pain. Born with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, she was later in a car accident, then a white-water rafting accident that made her back problems worse.

“I had so much pain that I would wake up and reach my arm out to touch my alarm … and something would just snap,” the 26-year-old who now lives in Aruba said.

When she was a teen, doctors recommended surgery to straighten her spine. Both her aunt and grandmother also were diagnosed with scoliosis. Her aunt opted for the back surgery, which helped alleviate pain but also left her with very limited movement in her spine.

Then, a friend suggested Brathen try yoga. She decided to try a few classes before undergoing the knife.

More than 22 million people practice yoga in the United States, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Many of them practice to improve flexibility and find pain relief, according to the Yoga Journal.

But as Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, noted, it’s difficult to pin down whether yoga is effective at easing symptoms of those who have back pain.

“There are many types of yoga and so many different causes of back pain,” he said.

Despite the lack of conclusive research, Besser said, there is some recent evidence to suggest that people with chronic low-back pain who do a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may experience less pain and improve their ability to walk and move.

Ben Kane

In one randomized controlled trial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, back pain patients who learned yoga had better back function and were better able to manage their pain. Another study in the same journal showed that yoga improved disability from chronic back pain more than exercise or self-care instructions.

There is also a close relationship between yoga and stress, so taking yoga might reduce stress and, in turn, provide some relief to someone with a tense, achy back, noted Dr. Amit Sood, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

But as good as yoga may be for soothing stress and a sore back, Sood recommended getting medical clearance first and taking it slow and easy to start.

That’s exactly what Brathen did.

She started with gentle, restorative classes that focused on improving the core strength of her middle muscles. Little by little she noticed the pain was less intense and less frequent. She said it took years to move from a slow, meditative practice to more rigorous poses.

Today, she is not only nearly pain free, she is able to do advanced moves like handstands and acrobatic arm balances.

Brathen said she is so grateful for her yoga practice, she became an instructor. Now she travels the world teaching yoga and sharing her story. She started a social media challenge with the hashtag #yogaeverydamnday that has 1.6 million fans on Instagram.

But she said yoga has done more for her than just heal her lower back.

“Yoga helps with a feeling of well-being on so many levels,” she said. “The world could benefit more from people with flexible hearts than flexible bodies.”

Rachel George was used to being sick. A genetic condition left her with intellectual disabilities and a weak immune system. By 26, she had endured dozens of bacterial infections — kidney, ear, sinus, heart, bone, and more — and taken hundreds of antibiotic pills. But when she entered the Harborview Hospital in Seattle for a foot operation, her body’s defenses were pushed to a new limit. Hospitals are hotbeds for nasty — and sometimes deadly — infections. After her surgery, Rachel’s lungs picked up two: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both bugs are part of a growing category of bacterial infections that don’t respond to traditional antibiotics. Rachel was supposed to be in the hospital for five days. She stayed nine weeks. She developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was put on a ventilator with a tube down her throat. When her doctors finally released her, they told her mother she had three years to live, at most, before the bugs won. Three years later, in January 2010, Rachel was indeed close to death. She was spending half of every month in intensive care, the other half at home, an IV constantly dripping into her bloodstream. By then she had cycled through more than a dozen powerful antibiotics. Each time the doctors would give her a new drug, then watch helplessly as the bacteria overpowered it. “Every time we took her back to the hospital, it was a question of whether or not this was going to be it,” her mother, Rose George, told BuzzFeed News. One day the nurse on duty asked Rose if she’d ever considered phage therapy. Rose had never heard of it, and that’s unsurprising: The therapy, which uses specialized viruses (called bacteriophages) to kill bacteria, is only available in a handful of former Soviet countries. Rose asked her daughter’s doctor, but she’d never heard of phage either. Soon Rose was on the phone with doctors at a small clinic in Tbilisi, in the Republic of Georgia, ordering 100 glass vials of viruses at $8 a pop. She’s one of at least 300 people desperate enough to try this little-known viral therapy from Eastern Europe. It’s an extreme solution to what may be this century’s biggest medical crisis: the death of antibiotics.

Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, scientists have amassed a medical arsenal of more than 130 antibiotics. The drugs have prevented soldiers from losing limbs, and mothers from dying during childbirth. With access to antibiotics, parents no longer worry about losing their kid to an ear infection or bad scrape. But now antibiotics are everywhere — not just in orange pill bottles, but in the food given to pigs, cattle, and chicken. And the more the bugs interact with antibiotics, the quicker they evolve defense mechanisms. At least 18 strains of bacteria have evolved into “superbugs,” becoming resistant to most of our drugs. And pharmaceutical companies, more interested in profitable blockbusters like Viagra and Zoloft, haven’t developed a new class of antibiotics in 25 years. We’re dying because of it. More than 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic-resistant infections. By 2050, an estimated 10 million people worldwide will die by superbug. After two decades of warnings from the scientific community, the problem is finally getting serious attention. In his 2016 budget proposal released today, U.S. President Obama threw $1.2 billion at tackling the antibiotic-resistance crisis — nearly double the amount allocated last year. If approved by Congress, this money will go toward screening soil samples for new antibiotics, reducing the drugs in livestock feed, boosting hospital surveillance, and, perhaps, making phage therapy a viable option in the U.S. Phages are bacteria’s natural enemies. They work by injecting their DNA inside bacterial cells, where they replicate wildly, produce new phages, and eventually cause the bacteria to rupture — releasing even more viruses to hunt for bacterial prey. Phages’ power comes from two places: They are the most common and diverse organisms on Earth, and each phage harms only specific strains of bacteria. When you turn on the faucet, millions of phages flow out with your tap water. That leaves a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential agents to use in the fight against infection. Doctors have been using phages to kill bacteria for nearly a century — just not in the U.S. In 1923, a Georgian doctor named George Eliava set up the first phage therapy clinic, the Eliava Institute, in Tbilisi. Antibiotics hadn’t been discovered yet, so phages were a revolutionary weapon against all kinds of infections, Ryland Young, head of the Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University, told BuzzFeed News. “It was kind of pre-scientific — no one knew what these phages were except that they worked.” Five years later, penicillin came along. Effective, cheap, and quick to produce in large quantities, doctors in the U.S., U.K., and France quickly seized upon the “miracle drug” as a key to winning World War II. That also meant keeping this weapon away from the Soviets. With no access to antibiotics, scientists behind the Iron Curtain bolstered their use of phages instead. “At its very peak, when they were supplying the Russian army, the Eliava Institute was producing two to three tons of phages per day,” Zamphira Alavidze, a microbiologist in Tbilisi who worked at the Eliava Institute for 45 years, told BuzzFeed News. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Eliava’s phage production dropped significantly, and it downsized into a small research center. Today Georgian doctors frequently use antibiotics to treat infections, but often in combination with phages. “Every clinic, everywhere in Georgia, everybody uses the phages,” Alavidze said. The last decade, she added, has brought another big change: Two small phage clinics in Tbilisi have sprung up to cater specifically to the boom of international patients like Rachel. “Ten or fifteen years ago, nobody believed the phages would be so popular. They thought we were crazy,” Alavidze said. “Now, it’s not too easy to come to Georgia, but we try to help somehow because sometimes nothing else works.”

Randy Wolcott, a wound care doctor in Lubbock, Texas, first went to Tbilisi in 2007. He was fed up with the lack of options for his patients with drug-resistant infections, and wanted to investigate phages as a treatment of last resort. Wolcott spent a week at the Eliava Institute. It looked nothing like the gleaming and sterile high-rises of most U.S. hospitals — the building was small, some of the equipment looked ancient, and the walls were unpainted. But after observing the Georgian clinicians at work, Wolcott was sold. He walked into a city pharmacy and bought hundreds of vials of phages concocted for wound infections. “They were very cheap, and I bought them by the case,” Wolcott told BuzzFeed News. The only hiccup came when explaining his viral cargo to U.S. customs officials. “It can cause some problems when our government hears that you’re bringing viruses back from a former Soviet country,” Wolcott said, chuckling. “It’s hard to explain. It’s a virus, but it’s a virus only for bacteria, not for us.” Phages aren’t approved for use in the U.S. So, once back in Lubbock, Wolcott wrote to the Texas Board of Medicine and asked for permission to use the viruses on his wound patients. The board decided that, because these patients had exhausted all other options, Wolcott would be allowed to use the experimental treatment in a legal arrangement known as “compassionate use.” Wolcott’s patients saw improvement within days. In 11 of the cases, the patients’ wounds healed enough to save their limbs. He treated hundreds of patients using the original batch of phages he brought over from Tbilisi. Five years ago, he went back for more. Wolcott usually uses the phages in combination with traditional antibiotics. But he says he couldn’t have offered the same quality of treatment without the viruses. “Someone needs to do this in America,” Wolcott said. “To have a bank of stuff that we can turn to for these chronic infections? That would be huge.”

Until that happens, though, patients are looking abroad. Rose George’s internet search led her to a clinic in Tbilisi called the Phage Therapy Center. It was set up in 2005 by Phage International, a fledgling medical tourism outfit founded in Danville, California, by a computer scientist named Chris Smith. The center’s doctors asked Rose to send over a bacterial sample from Rachel’s lungs. Over the course of a month, Rose attempted to send several samples, but each was rejected by U.S. customs. Rose’s son tried driving a sample across the border into Canada, which led to a seven-hour interrogation by Canadian agents, followed by two more hours with the FBI on the U.S. side. Finally, Smith suggested that Rose ambiguously label the package as “medical records.” She did, and the shipment slipped through. A few weeks later, the Georgian doctors called Rose with good news: They would be able to design a concoction of phages to treat Rachel’s infections. After convincing Rachel’s doctor to write a prescription for the viruses (so they could cross the U.S. border), Rose paid the Georgian clinic $800 for a three-month supply. She was surprised that phages were so inexpensive; in contrast, her insurance company was forking over roughly $14,000 a month for Rachel’s antibiotics. A couple of weeks later, 10 boxes filled with 100 vials of phages landed on the Georges’ doorstep. Rose used a nebulizer to administer the phages twice a day so that Rachel could breathe the liquids into her lungs. Within three weeks, Rachel’s MRSA — the same infection she’d been fighting with antibiotics for three years — disappeared. It hasn’t returned in the five years since.

Advocates of phage therapy see it as a powerful new weapon in the war we’re quickly losing against bacterial infection. But phages are certainly not a cure-all. Just ask Roger Mintey, a 65-year-old retired accountant from the sleepy English town of Reigate. In 1991, Mintey caught a severe sinus infection that left him with a near-constant cold. He’s had it, on and off, ever since. In the first decade of fighting his illness, Mintey sought help at five English hospitals, underwent two surgeries, and took more than two dozen courses of antibiotics. Nothing worked. In 2006, he heard about phage therapy from his cousin’s wife, who’d gone to Tbilisi to treat a chronic bladder infection. She pointed Roger to Phage International, the same company that helped Rose George get her daughter’s phages. The Georgian doctors affiliated with the company said they could treat his sinus infection, so Mintey cut Phage International a check for $5,000 and sent a sample of his nasal discharge to Georgia via FedEx. Then, accompanied by a friend, he boarded his first-ever plane to fly to the company’s Phage Therapy Center. They landed in Tbilisi at 3 a.m. and were met by someone from the clinic, who escorted them to their hotel. Mintey was instructed to drink a phage preparation three times a day from his hotel room. Every couple of days he would go into the clinic for additional phage treatments. The clinic was inside a nondescript building, set up something like an indoor mall. ""You went through a set of double doors, passed by a suntanning place, and there you were: one office, two treatment rooms, and that was it,” Mintey told BuzzFeed News. A doctor and two nurses had him sit on a cushioned patient’s chair. They tipped the chair back so his nostrils faced up, and poured the phage liquid into his nose. He was instructed to say the word “cuckoo” as the phages slowly slid into all of his sinuses, seeping out from his nasal passages into his forehead and cheekbones. His nose started bleeding, but the clinicians told him it was nothing to worry about. They also gave him a shot of manuka honey extract in his butt, telling him it had antimicrobial properties. “It was all quite uncomfortable,” Mintey said. After two weeks, Mintey flew back to England. Three days later, his infection was back. “I realized the entire treatment had done absolutely nothing,” he said. Mintey claims to have called, emailed, faxed, and sent physical letters to his doctors in Georgia and to Phage International’s headquarters in California. He heard nothing back. (Smith, of Phage International, claims that emails sent to Roger at the time were bouncing, and that he only had Mintey’s friend’s phone number.) Eventually, the clinic sent Mintey more phages in the mail, but the infection persisted. He says he has not heard from them since. “I was very disappointed,” Mintey said. “By the end of 2007, I had given up on phages.” Mintey’s situation highlights many of the difficulties surrounding a therapy only accessible through a small and largely unregulated medical tourism industry. Smith says Phage International has served more than 300 patients to date, with some 4,000 registered on its website. He wants to open a new phage therapy clinic in Trinidad, which could be easier for American patients to visit. “During the past 10 years, you’d go to an investor or venture capitalist, and they’d never heard of phage — and they didn’t want to know about it,” he said. “Now that’s changed.” Nothing about Phage International is decidedly illegal, I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, told BuzzFeed News. But there are many ethical issues at play. What happens when something goes wrong? Or, as in Roger’s case, when a patient feels like he’s not getting what he paid for? “Who do you go after? Where do you do it?” Cohen said. “That’s where things get more tricky.”",Mail-Order Viruses Are The New Antibiotics,3,BuzzFeed

Dr. Mark Bertin is no A.D.H.D. pill-pusher.

The Pleasantville, N.Y., developmental pediatrician won’t allow drug marketers in his office, and says he doesn’t always prescribe medication for children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yet Dr. Bertin has recently changed the way he talks about medication, offering parents a powerful argument. Recent research, he says, suggests the pills may “normalize” the child’s brain over time, rewiring neural connections so that a child would feel more focused and in control, long after the last pill was taken.

“There might be quite a profound neurological benefit,” he said in an interview.

A growing number of doctors who treat the estimated 6.4 million American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. are hearing that stimulant medications not only help treat the disorder but may actually be good for their patients’ brains. In an interview last spring with Psych Congress Network, http://www.psychcongress.com/video/are-A.D.H.D.-medications-neurotoxic-or-neuroprotective-16223an Internet news site for mental health professionals, Dr. Timothy Wilens, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said “we have enough data to say they’re actually neuroprotective.” The pills, he said, help “normalize” the function and structure of brains in children with A.D.H.D., so that, “over years, they turn out to look more like non-A.D.H.D. kids.”

Medication is already by far the most common treatment for A.D.H.D., with roughly 4 million American children taking the pills — mostly stimulants, such as amphetamines and methylphenidate. Yet the decision can be anguishing for parents who worry about both short-term and long-term side effects. If the pills can truly produce long-lasting benefits, more parents might be encouraged to start their children on these medications early and continue them for longer.

Leading A.D.H.D. experts, however, warn the jury is still out.

“Sometimes wishful thinking gives us hope that the impressive short-term relative benefits of medication over other treatments will persist beyond childhood, but I haven’t seen it,” said James Swanson, director of the Child Development Center at the University of California at Irvine. Dr. Swanson, a co-author of a landmark federally funded study, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, said that follow-up research found overall improvement but no greater long-term benefits after three years for children who were treated with medication compared to those who weren’t. One possible reason, as the report noted, was that many children refuse to continue taking medication after a year or so, something most parentsof such children well know.

Research has shown that the brains of people with A.D.H.D. on average look and function differently than those who don’t have the disorder, particularly when it comes to processing two important neurotransmitters: dopamine and norepinephrine. For most people with A.D.H.D., stimulants can temporarily boost focus, motivation and self-control by increasing the availability of these chemical messengers. The question is whether these effects can last once the drugs have left the bloodstream.

In arguing for “normalization,” Dr. Wilens cited a major review in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry in late 2013, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107764 which looked at 29 brain-scan studies. Although the studies had different methods and goals, the authors said that, together, they suggested that stimulants “are associated with attenuation of abnormalities in brain structure, function, and biochemistry in subjects with A.D.H.D.”

But other A.D.H.D. experts challenge this conclusion. Dr. F. Xavier Castellanos, director of research at the New York University Child Study Center, called assertions that stimulants are neuroprotective “exaggerated,” adding: “The best inference is that there is no evidence of harm from medications – normalization is a possibility, but far from demonstrated.”

A.D.H.D. is an exceptionally controversial diagnosis, with particular controversy zeroing in on researchers, including Dr. Wilens himself and some of the authors of the 2013 report he cited who have received financial support from pharmaceutical firms. In an email, Dr. Wilens said he had not received “any personal income” from the pharmaceutical industry since 2009.

As several experts noted, a major impediment to determining the long-term impacts of A.D.H.D. medication is that a “gold-standard” study would require researchers to assign children randomly to groups that either received medication or didn’t. Such a practice has been deemed unethical due to the widespread belief that the medication can help struggling children, at least in the short-term.

And other research has raised new concerns. One peer-reviewed 2013 study, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0063023 co-authored by Dr. Swanson suggested that the stimulants may change the brain over time so as to undermine the long-term response to the medication and even exacerbate symptoms when people aren’t taking them.

Dr. Peter Jensen, the former associate director of child and adolescent research at the National Institute of Mental Health, cautioned that parents should not try to force children with A.D.H.D. to take medication when they don’t want to, adding that “most kids don’t want to.”

Dr. Jensen, who now heads the REACH Institute, a national nonprofit organization concerned with children’s mental health, once surveyed 100 parents of sons and daughters in their 20s who had been diagnosed with A.D.H.D., asking what made the most difference.

“Eighty percent of them said ‘Love your child. Help him or her advocate for themselves, and find a doc who’ll work with you through thick or thin whether you medicate or not,” Dr. Jensen said. “Only a minority of these parents mentioned medication.”

story_reviews_00696,"Leonard Guarente, one of the best-known antiaging researchers in the region, and the roster of eminent scientists have formed Elysium Health, which on Tuesday will debut its first product, a pill called Basis. They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.

A leading biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with backing from five scientists who are Nobel prize recipients, is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue, improve brain function, and increase energy levels by improving “metabolic health.”

Many products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.

“There have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,” said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”

The active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.

At a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month’s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only. The company’s chief executive is Eric Marcotulli, previously a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital.

Among the scientific heavyweights advising Elysium Health are Martin Karplus, emeritus professor of chemistry at Harvard and a 2013 Nobel Laureate; Tom Sudhof, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who received a Nobel in 2013; Eric Kandel, a biochemist and biophysicist at Columbia University and a 2000 Nobel Laureate; Aaron Ciechanover, distinguished research professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a 2004 Nobel recipient; and Jack Szostak, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who received a Nobel in 2009.

Szostak said his role at Elysium Health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company’s attention as potential ingredients in new products.

“What interests me in this is that it is a different challenge, to apply what we are learning through basic research, not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy,” said Szostak, who runs a research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. “If you go to Whole Foods or CVS, you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins. Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don’t know what you are getting.”

Guarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.

With Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.

If Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.

But as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.

Indeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company’s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.

“It is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,” said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?”

Puigserver, who runs a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms.

“We need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything,” he said.

Guarente pledged that Elysium Health would be unlike most other companies in the business: It is conducting studies of its pill in humans and will release the results.

“As soon as we have analyzed the data, we will publish them on our website,” he said.

One of the venture capitalists backing Elysium Health acknowledged that skepticism is among the company’s greater challenges.

“This space is traditionally driven by marketing language,” said Kal Vapuri, whose New York firm Trisiras Group is one of Elysium’s initial funders. “But we will be data-driven and will communicate the complexities of science in simple ways.”

story_reviews_00697,"Numerous studies in recent years have suggested that vitamins and supplements have no beneficial effect on your health. Some researchers have gone as far as to warn that popping them may be harmful.

But the fact is that most of us cannot get the vitamins and minerals we need from food alone, and multivitamins are vital to bridging that gap. According to a study published in the January 2015 edition of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, roughly 40 percent of adults are deficient in vitamin A, C, D, E, calcium and magnesium. These findings suggest many people may not even have the nutrient levels they need to stave off disease— let alone thrive and live in optimal health. As I see it, everyone needs a multivitamin for disease prevention, and new research agrees.

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

Another study, published in the January 2015 edition of the journal Postgraduate Medicine, suggests that 68,000 cancers per year would be prevented with daily multivitamin use. The study followed only men, but my take is there’s no reason to assume this doesn’t apply to women as well. In the study, multivitamins lowered cancer risk by 27 percent among men with a history of cancer and by 8 percent among men with no history of the disease. This new study used a randomized, controlled trial design— a method that is considered to be the “gold standard” for proof in medical science.

I’ve always recommended targeted vitamin supplementation to my patients because when you boost levels of key nutrients in your body, you give yourself the best chances of preventing cancer, heart disease, dementia and other diseases.

While several previous studies failed to prove the benefits of some vitamins, the fact is, many of those studies have been criticized for poor design and are the reason fewer tangible benefits have been proven. At the very least, you should be taking a multivitamin every day. That said, not all multivitamins are created equal— some contain cheaper and less absorbable forms of nutrients, so you won’t get their full benefits, and others have ingredients you should be wary of.

Here are a few tips for selecting a high-quality multivitamin that will help you look and feel your best:

Go for high quality

When you look at a typical multivitamin label at the drugstore, you’ll see it has about 100 percent of the daily values recommended for a nutrient. The federal government developed these values during World War II to prevent widespread nutrient deficiency— so while that amount should be enough to make sure you have what you need to survive, it won’t necessarily be enough for optimal health.

In some of the higher-quality supplements, you'll see things like Vitamin B-6 at 2,500 percent of your daily value. That may sound wacky, but keep in mind that 100 percent is just the level for basic survival— and that 2,500 percent is going to give you more of what you actually need to feel good. Look for high-quality brands with these higher doses. Because I know there can be a lot of guesswork when it comes to finding a good multivitamin, I created my own formula specifically designed to provide key nutrients that boost your energy, which is available on my website.

Get one that will be absorbed well by your body

Some forms of vitamins are better absorbed in your body. When scanning the label, look for B12 as methylcobalamin as opposed to cyanocobalamin, and when it comes to folic acid, look for methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) rather than straight folic acid. Both are forms of B9, but MTHF is the form of B9 found in nature. For vitamin A, look for beta carotene and mixed carotenoids, which are derived from plants and are water soluble. And look for vitamin D3 as opposed to D2. Seventy years ago, these two forms of vitamin D were seen as equals, but recent research has shown that D3 is a more potent form of D.

Avoid toxic fillers

Some vitamin companies use colorants and coatings that may be harmful. These include hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide. Magnesium stearate could even compromise your immunity— a study in the journal Immunology found that stearic acid suppresses T cells, a key part of your immune system. The vitamins you take should enhance your health, so be sure to scan the labels for these cheap additives and steer clear of them.

story_reviews_00698,"How do you convert a simple saline solution into a useful treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease? Tell them it’s a drug that costs $100 per dose. And if you want to make it even more effective, tell them it costs $1,500 instead.

That’s what researchers from the University of Cincinnati discovered in an unusual clinical trial. Instead of testing a placebo against an actual drug, they pitted two placebos against each other. The only difference between the two sham treatments was their purported price.

Medical researchers are well aware that the dummy pills used in clinical trials often provide as much relief as the actual drugs being tested. This is what’s known as the placebo effect, and it’s quite common in people with Parkinson’s, a movement disorder that causes tremors, stiffness and balance problems. A 2008 meta-analysis found that placebos used in clinical trials of Parkinson’s treatments improved symptoms by an average of 16%.

The team from the University of Cincinnati and their colleagues had a hunch that patients would be more responsive to a fake drug they thought was real if it came with a heftier price tag. The higher price would be seen as a signal that the treatment was better, they figured.

So they recruited 12 patients with “moderately advanced” Parkinson’s and asked them to participate in a clinical trial of a medication described as “a new injectable dopamine agonist.” Patients with Parkinson’s lose the brain cells that produce dopamine, and a drug like this could pick up the slack.

The study volunteers were told that there were two versions of the experimental drug and that both were believed to work equally well. The main difference, the story went, was the way they were made. As a result, one version cost 15 times more than the other.

In reality, both placebos were composed of the exact same saline solution. And yet, the patients perceived the expensive version to be more effective than the cheaper one, according to results published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.

Both of the placebos improved motor function compared with a base line test. But when patients got the $1,500-per-dose placebo, their improvement was 9% greater than when they got the $100-per-dose placebo, the researchers reported.

In another test, 67% of the patients were judged “very good” or having “marked improvement” after they took the expensive placebo, compared with 58% of patients after they took the purportedly cheap placebo.

The researchers also used functional MRI scans to assess the patients’ brain activity and found that the “cheap” placebo prompted more action than the “expensive” one. To the researchers, this was a sign that the patients expected less from the placebo they believed cost less, so their brains responded by doing more work.

“Patients’ expectations have an important role in the efficacy of medical therapies,” the researchers wrote. Another manifestation of this is the preference many patients have for name-brand drugs instead of their generic counterparts, they added.

Placebos may be fake, but understanding the placebo effect – and finding ways to make the most of it – is a real priority for researchers. To the extent that doctors can use placebos to improve patients’ symptoms, they can use the real drugs less, which may be expensive or toxic.

“Placebo can be the physician’s friend,” a pair of neurologists wrote an editorial that accompanied the study. “The outcome of this study … opens our eyes to another nuance of placebo effect.”

story_reviews_00699,"LONDON (Reuters) - First results from a human trial of an Ebola vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline show it is safe and generates an immune response, scientists said on Wednesday, but larger trials are needed to see if it protects and if a booster is needed.

The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week.

That trial is the first of several mid-stage studies planned for West Africa and aims to test GSK’s vaccine and one from Merck and NewLink. Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic have a vaccine in early-stage clinical tests.

The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK’s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford’s Jenner Institute, said it was “encouraging” that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system.

“The safety profile is pretty much as we’d hoped and the immune responses are okay, but not great,” he told Reuters.

The data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year.

The volunteers got one of three doses - low, medium, or high - and data from 28 days after vaccination showed the shot was safe at these doses, with only mild side effects.

“People typically experienced mild symptoms that lasted for one or maybe two days, such as pain or reddening at the injection site, and occasionally people felt feverish,” Hill said.

However, the antibody response was weaker than was found in a trial of the same Ebola vaccine in macaque monkeys, in which the animals were also found to be protected.

Hill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system’s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed.

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided “good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people”.

“However, we still don’t know whether it will provide protection against Ebola infection in a real-world situation,” he said. “That’s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.”",Trial finds GSK Ebola shot is safe and provokes immune response,4,Reuters
story_reviews_00700,"(Reuters Health) – - Adding spice – in the form of curcumin supplements – to the daily diets of people with risk factors for heart disease may lower inflammation, a new study suggests.

Inflammation is implicated in a wide range of illnesses, from heart disease to cancer and joint pain. In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.

“Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.

“Two key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,” said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.

These properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.

Having a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.

Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.

Half were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.

At the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.

They found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.

The study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.

“The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,” Sahebkar said.

The researchers didn’t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it’s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.

The study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.

Sahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.

“Curcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,” Sahebkar said.

However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.

“In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,” Sahebkar said.

Sahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.

“Whilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,” he said.

Sahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.

story_reviews_00701,"THE QUESTION Memory wanes as mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease sets in. Might insulin, a drug used for diabetes, help?

THIS STUDY randomly assigned 60 adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease to be given, via nasal spray, 20- or 40-milligram doses of insulin detemir (Levemir), a man-made insulin that is longer acting than natural insulin, or a placebo daily for three weeks.

Standardized tests given at the start and end of the study showed that working memory, sometimes thought of as short-term memory, improved for those given 40 milligrams of insulin but not for those given the smaller dose or the placebo.

Also, among those in the 40-milligram group, people carrying what is sometimes called the Alzheimer’s gene (APOE-e4) showed more improvement than non-carriers.

WHO MAY BE AFFECTED ? People in the early stages of dementia. Some research has suggested a link between lower levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid and the formation of plaques often found in the brain tissue of people with Alzheimer’s.

Memory loss is often the first sign of dementia, which in later stages can interfere with such things as the ability to solve problems, control emotions or do such daily tasks as eating and dressing.

CAVEATS The study involved a relatively small number of participants and lasted a short time; a larger and longer study would be needed to adequately test effectiveness and safety.

In a pilot study at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, researchers studied 60 adults between the ages of 55 and 85 diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Participants were nasally administered doses of man-made insulin called insulin detemir for 21 days.

The insulin detemir is designed to attach to album, a blood protein. Album absorbs the insulin detemir, distributing it throughout the body and allowing it to work. Because the insulin detemir dissolves from the protein slowly, it has a longer period of exposure in the body, lead study author Dr. Suzanne Craft, professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest Baptist told FoxNews.com.

Participants who received 40 international unit (IU) doses of insulin detemir over the course of the trial showed significant improvement in their short-term ability to retain and process verbal and visual information, compared with those who received 20 IU doses or a placebo. According to Craft, performance on tests of mental manipulation and memory improved by as much as 25 percent.

Even recipients who carried the APOE-e4 gene – which is proven to increase Alzheimer's risk – showed significantly higher memory scores than those who received the lower dosage or placebo.

“Our team was surprised at the level of improvement for the participants with the gene that raises Alzheimer's risk, as very few types of therapies have been shown to benefit these patients,” Craft said.

Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms behind insulin detemir’s effect on memory.

The insulin detemir doses did not cause any negative side effects, and Craft said the study's overall results support further investigation of insulin detemir as a treatment for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Researchers hope to follow up on the pilot study in a larger group of participants who would receive the insulin detemir for a longer period of time. Additionally, Craft said they would also like to directly compare the insulin detemir to other forms of insulin to see which provides the most therapeutic benefit.

story_reviews_00703,"Take a deep breath and relax.

Behind that common piece of advice is a complex series of physiological processes that calm the body, slow the heart and help control pain.

Breathing and controlling your breath is one of the easiest ways to improve mental and physical health, doctors and psychologists say. Slow, deep and consistent breathing has been shown to have benefits in treating conditions ranging from migraines and irritable bowel syndrome to anxiety disorders and pain.

“If you train yourself to breathe a little bit slower it can have long-term health benefits,” said Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. Deep breathing activates a relaxation response, he said, “potentially decreasing inflammation, improving heart health, boosting your immune system and maybe even improving longevity,”

To help foster the habit of healthful breathing, a San Francisco technology startup recently launched a wearable device called Spire that tracks breathing patterns and tells users when they are too tense or anxious. “One of the goals of this work was, ‘How do you make it so simple to shift into calm or focus that people don’t have to stop what they’re doing?’” said Neema Moraveji, co-founder of Spire and director of the Calming Technology Lab at Stanford University.

Many early buyers of the $150 Spire are office workers who spend a lot of time on computers. Research has found people working on computers often hold their breath, an action referred to as screen apnea, he said.

Belisa Vranich, a New York City-based clinical psychologist, has been conducting breathing workshops around the country for just over a year. Among her biggest clients: corporate managers eager to learn how to better manage stress.

Dr. Vranich says she instructs clients to breathe with their abdomen. On the inhale, this encourages the diaphragm to flatten out and the ribs to flare out. Most of us by instinct breathe vertically, using our chest, shoulders and neck, she says.

Abdominal, or diaphragmatic, breathing is often taught in yoga and meditation classes. Experts say air should be breathed in through the nose, and the exhale should be longer than the inhale. Dr. Vranich recommends trying to breathe this way all the time but other experts say it is enough to use the technique during stressful or tense times or when it is necessary to focus or concentrate.

Slow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the stem of the brain to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body’s “rest and digest” activities. (By contrast, the sympathetic nervous system regulates many of our “fight or flight” responses.)

The vagus-nerve activity causes the heart rate to decrease as we exhale, said Richard Gevirtz, a psychology professor at Alliant International University in San Diego. Vagal activity can be activated when breathing at about five to seven breaths a minute, said Dr. Gevirtz, compared with average breathing rates of about 12 to 18 breaths a minute.

The vagus nerve’s response includes the release of different chemicals, including acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that acts as an anti-inflammatory and slows down digestion and the heart rate, said Stephen Silberstein, director of the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who is working on an article on the vagus nerve and its functions.

When medical conditions are severe, such as with epilepsy, medical devices are sometimes implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve. For most people, slow, steady breathing is a natural way to stimulate the nerve.

Certain conditions, including asthma and panic disorders, have been shown to benefit from a different breathing technique—taking shallow breaths through the nose at a regular rhythmic speed of eight to 13 breaths a minute. For these patients, already anxious about their symptoms, deep breathing can cause them to take in too much air and hyperventilate.

Heart-rate-variability biofeedback uses breathing to train people to increase the variation in their heart rate, or the interval between heartbeats. The technique has been shown to have benefits for conditions including anxiety disorders and asthma. Biofeedback also makes breathing more efficient, said Paul Lehrer, a clinical psychologist at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, part of Rutgers University in New Jersey. On average most people reach this balance when breathing 11 seconds per breath.

Spire, the device that tracks individual breathing patterns, is a pedometer-like device that can be clipped onto pants or a bra strap and can sense breathing patterns without touching the skin. A sensor detects subtle torso expansions and contractions, said Stanford’s Dr. Moraveji. The device identifies people’s baseline breathing patterns and can tell users when they are tense or may need to take a deep breath. It includes an app that guides people in breathing exercises as short as 30 seconds.

Dr. Moraveji’s research includes a 2011 Stanford study of 13 students that found subjects on average took 16.7 breaths a minute when they were doing normal computer work compared with 9.3 breaths a minute when they were relaxed, he said. The study was published in the proceedings of the annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology.

A follow-up study involving 14 subjects found that giving feedback of breathing patterns on a computer screen allowed the subjects to control their breathing without decreasing their performance on an analytical task, Dr. Moraveji said. “We proved that because the breath is so easily controllable, you don’t have to interrupt your task in order to regulate your nervous system,” he said. The study was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in 2012.

Dr. Vranich, the breathing coach, believes teaching people to unlearn dysfunctional breathing habits requires practice and exercises. Her group classes cost $150 for a three-hour workshop and private classes range from $350 to $450.

On a recent afternoon, she held a private session in her Manhattan studio with Joe March, a 40-year-old New York City firefighter who said he wanted to improve his lung capacity and condition for Brazilian jujitsu, a form of martial arts he practices.

Dr. Vranich positions many of her clients upside down, to better exercise the diaphragm muscles. She assisted Mr. March into a shoulder stand against a wall as she monitored his breathing. “Inhale, relax, and see if you can expand right by your diaphragm,” she said. “Exhale, squeeze your ribs at the same time.”

Earl Winthrop, a 60-year-old partner of a Boston wealth-management firm, is another of Dr. Vranich’s clients. “When I was working on the computer, I wasn’t breathing properly,” said Mr. Winthrop, who now does tailored breathing exercises and short bouts of meditative breathing. “I’m much more aware now. I feel more focused. I can calm myself down,” he said.",Breathing for Your Better Health,2,Wall Street Journal

Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto

When Amy Seitz got pregnant with her second child last year, she knew that being 35 years old meant there was an increased chance of chromosomal disorders like Down syndrome. She wanted to be screened, and she knew just what kind of screening she wanted — a test that's so new, some women and doctors don't quite realize what they've signed up for.

This kind of test , called cell free fetal DNA testing, uses a simple blood sample from an expectant mother to analyze bits of fetal DNA that have leaked into her bloodstream. It's only been on the market since October 2011 and is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA does not regulate this type of genetic testing service. Several companies now offer the test, including Sequenom and Illumina. Insurance coverage varies, and doctors often only offer this testing to women at higher risk because of things like advanced maternal age.

""I think that I initially heard about it through family and friends,"" says Seitz. ""They had had the option of it given to them by their doctors.""

To her, it sounded great. She didn't want an invasive procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.Those are considered the gold standard for prenatal genetic testing, but doctors must put a needle into the womb to collect cells that contain fetal DNA, which means a small risk of miscarriage.

""I wasn't interested in going as far as getting an amniocentesis because of the risk associated with that,"" she explains, ""and so when I heard about this test, that was part of the reason that I was most interested in it.""

This new way of testing fetal DNA seemed to have already become fairly common where Seitz used to live, in Washington, D.C. But she had recently moved to Alabama, and the clinic she went to there wasn't as familiar with it — although when she talked to her doctor, she learned the clinic had just had a visit from a company's sales representative.

""I think it was a fairly new test for them at that point, but she was interested in pursuing it further to see what needed to be done,"" Seitz says.

Seitz got her blood drawn last July, becoming one of hundreds of thousands of pregnant women who've opted for this new kind of test instead of the more traditional, invasive ones. Doctors say the impact has been huge.

""Those of us in the field who do diagnostic procedures like CVS and amnio have seen a drastic decrease in the number of those procedures that are being performed,"" says Dr. Mary Norton, an expert on maternal-fetal medicine and genetics at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Places are reporting doing fewer than half the number of procedures that were being done previously.""

But, she says, things have changed so quickly that it may be hard for doctors and patients to know what they're dealing with.

""It's still new and it's quite different than previous genetic testing that's been available,"" says Norton. ""It's quite a different paradigm, if you will.""

An invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS lets doctors get a complete picture of the chromosomes and a solid diagnosis.

Until the new testing technology came along, the only less invasive option was for an expectant mother to get an ultrasound, plus have her blood tested for specific proteins. This can reveal if there's an increased risk of certain disorders, but it's not very accurate and produces a lot of false alarms.

Studies have shown that the new fetal DNA tests do a better job, says Norton. They're less likely to flag a normal pregnancy as high risk.

""They're much more accurate than current screening tests, but they are not diagnostic tests in the sense that amniocentesis is,"" says Norton, ""and so I think that has led to some confusion.""

Even though the newer blood tests do look at fetal DNA, they can't give a definitive answer like an amniocentesis can because they're analyzing scraps of fetal DNA in the mother's blood that are all mixed up with her own DNA.

Norton says when women get worrisome results from one of these new tests and are referred to her center, they sometimes don't understand why doctors are offering a follow-up amnio ""because they were under the impression that this was as good as an amnio.""

She is concerned that some people might end a pregnancy without getting confirmatory testing and points to one study last year that found a small number of women did that.

""There's at least some evidence that it's happening to a greater degree than I think many of us are comfortable with,"" she says.

The tests are being used more and more widely. Some worry that the companies' websites and marketing materials don't make the limitations clear enough.

But Dr. Lee Shulman doesn't see it that way. He's an obstetrician and geneticist at Northwestern University in Chicago who has consulted for a couple of the testing firms.

""Patients need to understand that while this is better, it is not a diagnostic test, and I think the companies have done a great job in putting this material out,"" he says. ""Whether or not clinicians use this material and take it to heart and use it for patient counseling is a different story.""

He says the technology is so new that a lot of doctors have no experience with it, and consumers need to understand that.

""If the patient, if the couple, are not getting the answers, not getting the information they feel comfortable with, they need to seek out prenatal diagnostic centers, maternal fetal specialists, clinical geneticists, who may have more experience,"" says Shulman.

For example, here's one thing that might turn out to be a little more complicated than would-be parents might expect. Along with screening for the common chromosomal disorders, companies offer parents the chance to learn their baby's sex — weeks before it's clear on a sonogram.

""Many women are very excited by the idea that as part of their blood testing, they could find out pretty definitively if the baby is a boy or a girl,"" says Dr. Diana Bianchi, an expert on prenatal diagnostics at Tufts University School of Medicine.

What they may not realize, she says, is that the test will also determine whether there's something abnormal about the sex chromosomes.

""Approximately 1 in 700 pregnancies there's an extra X or extra Y,"" she says, noting that these are mild conditions that would normally go undetected, unless a woman had an invasive test like an amnio. Some babies with these conditions grow up into adulthood and never know they have them, unless they face a symptom like infertility.

Seitz, in Alabama, thought it was a bonus that getting this new blood test would tell her if she was having a boy or a girl. But it actually didn't do that, because of a paperwork glitch.

""The box for sex got unchecked somewhere along the way, so we weren't able to find it out from the test,"" says Seitz, who learned from an ultrasound that she was having a girl. The results she did get from the fetal DNA test were reassuring.",DNA Blood Test Gives Women A New Option For Prenatal Screening,4,NPR
story_reviews_00707,"(CNN) Even after decades of battling one of the world's biggest killers, the treatment of cancer is still an inexact science.

Successful methods such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells, but they also destroy healthy tissue.

Health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer -- and everything from monoclonal antibodies, which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells, to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success.

In Belgium, engineer and nuclear physicist Yves Jongen is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation; a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects.

""I started to designing equipment (for) proton therapy of cancer -- that was a radically new idea,"" Jongen told CNN.

Encased in a two-metre thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield, one of Jongen's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients.

""In this space we accelerate the protons and we give them a higher and higher velocity until they reach two thirds of the speed of light -- that's 200,000 km per second and this acceleration takes place in the shape of a spiral,"" he said.

It does a lot less collateral damage to the patient - that's the great thing about proton therapy Yves Jongen

""That's needed if you want to be able to penetrate one foot into the body of a patient.""

Once the proton beam has been generated, it's piped into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful dose of targeted radiation that kills only those cancerous cells.

""It does a lot less collateral damage to the patient,"" Jongen said. ""That's the great thing about proton therapy.""

While proton therapy is a giant step forward, it's not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for. So far, it is not effective against all types of cancer.

""There are a number of cancers which are not localized,"" he said. ""If you look at leukemia, which is cancer of the blood cells, there is nowhere to shoot -- it's all through the body.""

The other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap.

Each system -- and the bunker needed to house it -- doesn't leave much change from $125 million. Currently there are just 43 operational particle therapy facilities worldwide , with a total of 121 treatment rooms.

As the fame of the process has started to spread, some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment. One British couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors' permission to get to a proton center in Prague in the Czech Republic.

Proton treatment is limited on Britain's National Health Service. Just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors. Other centers, however, are currently in development.

Yves Jongen

While the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by 2018, with an estimated 300 proton therapy rooms, Jongen's Brussels-based company IBA is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible.

""It would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it -- a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year.""

At the moment, fewer than 1% of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy, but Jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer.

""I have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid,"" he said.

""That's something I really cherish. When I feel a bit depressed, for whatever reason, I go back to those letters and they are very exciting.""

THURSDAY, Jan. 22, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A therapy involving ""video feedback"" -- where parents watch videos of their interactions with their baby -- might help prevent infants at risk for autism from developing the disorder, a new study suggests.

The research involved 54 families of babies who were at increased risk for autism because they had an older sibling with the condition.

Some of the families were assigned to a therapy program in which a therapist used video feedback to help parents understand and respond to their infant's individual communication style.

The goal of the therapy -- delivered over five months while the infants were ages 7 to 10 months -- was to improve the infant's attention, communication, early language development, and social engagement.

Other families were assigned to a control group that received no therapy.

After five months, infants in the families in the video therapy group showed improvements in attention, engagement and social behavior, according to the study published Jan. 22 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

Using the therapy during the baby's first year of life may ""modify the emergence of autism-related behaviors and symptoms,"" lead author Jonathan Green, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Manchester in England, said in a journal news release.

""Children with autism typically receive treatment beginning at 3 to 4 years old,"" he explained. ""But our findings suggest that targeting the earliest risk markers of autism -- such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement -- during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later on.""

Two experts agreed that early intervention is key.

""Research has shown that subtle markers of autism are identifiable in the first year of life,"" explained Dr. Ron Marino, associate chair of pediatrics at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. ""Video feedback seems like a natural and potentially very potent extension of intervention when it can be most effective,"" he added.

Dr. Andrew Adesman is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was cautiously optimistic about the promise of the video feedback approach.

""Although it would be wonderful if a relatively simple, video-based intervention could reduce the recurrence risk of autism spectrum disorder in later offspring, further studies are needed to examine this very issue,"" he said. Those studies ""will need to include a larger, more diverse sample population and need to look at developmental outcomes over a much longer period of time.""

story_reviews_00709,"The Ache: Common cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins can have unpleasant side effects, including muscle aches and weakness.

The Claim: An extract from a bitter, fragrant citrus fruit called bergamot, commonly known as a flavoring in Earl Grey tea, can lower cholesterol with minimal side effects, some scientists say. It also boosts good cholesterol, reduces fatty deposits in the liver and lowers blood sugar, they add.

The Verdict: Bergamot has been shown to lower cholesterol in at least four human studies published or presented at scientific meetings. But much of the work is authored by a group of Italian researchers who work closely with a company that sells the extract, scientists say. Larger, independent studies in other countries are needed to confirm the results, they say.

Bergamot fruit grows on sunny slopes in Southern Italy and are rich in substances called flavonoids, which likely are the reason for its beneficial effects says Arrigo Cicero, a scientist in the atherosclerosis and metabolic disease research unit of the University of Bologna. But he adds that he feels additional human studies are needed to prove efficacy.

Flavonoids are antioxidants, or substances some scientists believe reduce chemical reactions in the body that damage cells. Earl Grey tea likely contains too little bergamot to have a therapeutic effect, scientists say, though the tea is high in another class of antioxidant called catechins.

Bergamot supplements, often in 500 milligram or 650 milligram capsules or tablets, are intended to be taken before meals. In human studies, a bergamot extract was shown effective at a dose of 500 milligrams to 1,500 milligrams a day, according to published results.

In a monthlong study of 77 patients published in 2013 in the International Journal of Cardiology, 1,000 milligrams daily of bergamot extract lowered cholesterol from an average of 278 milligrams per deciliter of blood to 191.

The study also found that by adding bergamot researchers were able to reduce by half the dose of the cholesterol drug rosuvastatin without a reduction in efficacy, says study co-author Vincenzo Mollace, professor at the Magna Graecia University in Catanzaro, Italy. Dr. Mollace, a cardiologist, is a paid scientific consultant to Italy’s Herbal & Antioxidant Derivatives Srl, which sells the extract for use in dietary supplements.

“The data looks very good,” says David Frid, a staff physician in the section of preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. “But it would be beneficial for this to be reproduced [by another research group] in order to say that in fact this is a true cholesterol-lowering effect.”

While Dr. Mollace’s study showed mild heartburn as the only side effect, larger long-term studies are needed to establish safety.

“I would tell a patient the caveat is, ‘If you want to try it, you need to be aware that we don’t really know its side effects,’ ” says Dr. Frid. In addition, he adds, statins have been shown to improve health outcomes, such as reducing heart attacks, while bergamot hasn’t yet met that rigorous test.

A glass of bergamot juice tastes like sour grapefruit, making capsules a palatable way to ingest a therapeutic dose, says Annie Eng, chief executive of HP Ingredients Inc., a Bradenton, Fla., company that sells its Bergamonte brand extract to about 30 U.S. dietary-supplement companies.

Some brands combine bergamot with other ingredients. Bergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed.

The company hasn’t studied the combination, but it “logically it would make sense” that the two would work well together, says Rob Maru, the company’s chief innovation officer.

The amount of plant flavonoids in dietary supplements with bergamot will vary significantly depending on the fruit itself and how it is processed, scientists say. BergaMet Mega from Australia’s Nathealthsolutions Pty Ltd., is formulated to have the same potency of flavonoids as used in Dr. Mollace’s studies, says Chief Executive Selwyn Barr.

Dr. Mollace, who serves as an unpaid scientific advisor to Nathealthsolutions, confirmed that BergaMet has the same concentration of flavonoids as the extract he studied.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood pressure is either the primary cause of or contributes to more than 1,000 deaths in the United States every day.

Researchers have concluded that one glass of beetroot juice a day is enough to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure . They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants.

Medical researchers have recently returned to this plant product to investigate its effect on blood pressure and explore opportunities to put it to use in modern medicine and the home management of conditions.

Beetroot has been used since the Middle Ages as a treatment for ailments, particularly those relating to the blood and digestion.

If you buy something through a link on this page, we may earn a small commission. How this works.

High blood pressure is a serious public health concern. It increases the risk of more dangerous health conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, and chronic heart failure. High blood pressure is also a major risk factor for kidney disease.

Share on Pinterest Beetroot juice has been investigated for the powerful effect of its nitrate content on blood pressure.

Beetroot contains high levels of dietary nitrate (NO3), which the body converts into biologically active nitrite (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). In the human body, NO relaxes and dilates blood vessels.

Other leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and cabbage, also have high levels of the compound. They take it up from the soil through their roots.

A meta-analysis of 16 trials was published in The Journal of Nutrition in 2013.

The researchers found that ""Inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.""

One major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation.

They found the following results:

""This interesting study builds on previous research by this team and finds that a daily glass of beetroot juice can lower blood pressure in people with hypertension - even those whose high blood pressure was not controlled by drug treatment."" Dr. Shannon Amoils, British Heart Foundation, senior research advisor

For the trial, Prof. Amrita Ahluwalia of the vascular pharmacology department at QMUL and her colleagues recruited 64 people aged between 18 and 85 years.

Half of the participants were taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure but did not reach their target blood pressure, and the rest had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but were not yet taking medication for it.

The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group consumed a 250-milliliter (ml) glass of beetroot juice, and the other group had the same, except their beetroot juice was nitrate-free.

The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group.

All groups consumed the juice daily for 4 weeks. They were also monitored for 2 weeks before and after the study, bringing the total trial period to 8 weeks.

The trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement.

During the 4 weeks in which they were taking the juice, patients in the active supplement group, whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate, experienced a reduction in blood pressure of 8/4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

The first figure is systolic pressure, generated when the heart is pumping, and the second figure is diastolic pressure, created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range.

In the 2 weeks after they stopped drinking the juice, their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study.

This is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation's long-lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure.

Share on Pinterest High blood pressure is a common health issue in the U.S., and beetroot juice acts as a natural aid.

The patients in the active supplement group also experienced a 20 percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity, and their artery stiffness reduced by around 10 percent.

Studies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.

There were no changes in blood pressure, blood vessel function, or artery stiffness in the placebo group.

The authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication. The average reduction in blood pressure caused by a single anti-hypertension drug is 9/5 mmHg.

The study concludes:

""These findings suggest a role for dietary nitrate as an affordable, readily-available, adjunctive treatment in the management of patients with hypertension.""

To put the importance of these findings in context: The authors note that large-scale observational studies show that for every 2 mmHg increase in blood pressure, the risk of death from heart disease goes up 7 percent and the risk of stroke by 10 percent.",Beetroot juice and blood pressure: Study and benefits,3,health food claims

For most of her life Fran Friedman struggled with compulsive eating. At 59 years old she was 5 foot 2 and weighed 360 pounds. That's when she opted for bariatric surgery.

The surgery worked. Friedman, who is now 70 and lives in Los Angeles, lost 175 pounds. ""It was a miracle,"" Friedman says, not to feel hungry. ""It was the first time in my life that I've ever lost a lot of weight and was able to maintain it.""

Friedman kept the weight off for almost 10 years. But then to her dismay she started to gain it back. ""I thought I was cured,"" she says. ""I thought I could eat like regular people.""

She's not alone, says Dr. Rabindra Watson, Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Division of Digestive Diseases.

About one in three patients regain significant amounts of weight a few years after surgery to reduce the size of the stomach pouch. Bariatric surgery shrinks the stomach to about the size of an egg, so people feel full from eating very little food. The problem is that over the years the stomach stretches, and when that happens, Watson says, ""Patients are able to eat more at one sitting and they feel hungrier more often.""

At the same time, hormonal changes that reduce the appetite and take effect immediately after the surgery begin to decline. Watson says we don't know for sure, but it's possible the body begins to adapt to those changes, which is why the weight loss is reversed over time.

For Fran Friedman, it meant a 20-pound weight gain and a bout of depression. ""The reality hits,"" she says. ""Do I want to go back to where I was or do I want to maintain this level of quality of life?""

So Friedman opted for a less invasive procedure to make her stomach smaller again. It's called Transoral Outlet Reduction – or TORe for short. It's one of several procedures designed to help people maintain the benefits of bariatric surgery. This procedure involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth into the stomach while the patient is under anesthesia. It costs $8,000 to $13,000 and insurance coverage varies.

If the stomach pouch has stretched, new sutures are put in place to once again reduce the size of the stomach. After the surgery, Watson says, patients report feeling fuller and less hungry and they ultimately gain greater control over what they are eating. And research conducted over the past decade suggests it works. There are no significant side effects to the surgery, and patients can return to work the day after they have the procedure.

For Friedman, it did the trick. She has lost 30 pounds since her second surgery. And now, she says, with the help of a support group she is recommitted to watching what she eats and how much she exercises. She wants to lose another 20 pounds. And more importantly, she wants to keep the weight off.","When Bariatric Surgery's Benefits Wane, This Procedure Can Help",4,Philadelphia Inquirer
story_reviews_00713,"In a bid to increase treatments for the nation’s 79 million obese adults, the Food and Drug Administration has approved U.S. marketing of an implantable device that stimulates weight loss by manipulating key appetite signals passing between the brain and the gut.

The new device is the Maestro Rechargeable System, manufactured by EnteroMedics of St. Paul, Minn. While the FDA has approved four medications for weight loss in the past 2 1/2 years, the Maestro system is the first weight loss device to be approved since 2007.

Using electrical leads implanted just above the stomach and a regulator carried under the skin near the ribcage, the device suppresses signals carried by the vagus nerve.

The device adopts a variant of a “neuromodulation” technique long used in the treatment of epilepsy: by applying intermittent bursts of electrical current to the vagus nerve, it disrupts the signals that prompt the stomach to relax, expand and prepare for an influx of food.

“We think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co-morbidities,” said Gregory S. Lea, senior vice president and chief financial officer of EnteroMedics. “When patients leave the diet, counseling and drug world and have nothing more, they turn to surgical procedures, and only 1% to 2% of patients who might be eligible for bariatric surgery are getting it.”

The FDA approved the use of the device in adult patients with a body mass index, or BMI, between 35 and 45, who have at least one other obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.

Delivered by the Maestro device, vagal blocking therapy, or VBLOC, offers obese patients a weight loss therapy that does not permanently alter the digestive system in the way that gastric bypass surgery does, and which may be less expensive, said Lea. He added it poses no risk of the “malabsorption” problems that often come with such surgery.

In a 12-month clinical trial considered by the FDA, 38.3% of subjects who received the active Maestro device lost at least a quarter of their excess weight, and 52.5% of subjects lost at least 20% of their excess weight. On average, weight loss in those subjects with an active device was about 8.5% greater than that seen in subjects who received a Maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated.

The human body’s longest cranial nerve, the vagus--or “wandering""--nerve stretches from the lower abdomen up to the brain stem, passing through the heart, esophagus and lungs. A key node in the body’s involuntary nervous system, it carries signals between body and brain that control heart rate, digestive processes and respiration.

In a 60- to 90-minute laparoscopic procedure, physicians trained to implant the new device will attach its electrical leads to the anterior and posterior trunks of the vagus nerve, right at the gastric junction. During a patient’s waking hours, the device is designed to alternate between delivering five-minute bursts of high-frequency energy and five minutes of inactivity. During sleep, the device powers down.

By suppressing the exchange of messages that cue hunger and ready the stomach for food, the intermittent electrical currents make most feel less hungry, feel full sooner and to feel full for longer. Most eat less and lose weight.

Researchers testing the device also observed that, like bariatric surgery, it might have beneficial effects that go beyond weight loss. Suppressing signals between gut and brain on the vagus nerve appeared to improve the metabolic function of obese patients who got the device.

“You actually see the effect before patients actually have had that much weight loss,” said Dr. Ken Fujioka, a Scripps Institute endocrinologist and weight management expert who conducted some of the studies that led to the EnteroMedics device. That suggests that the device may be especially beneficial for those who have developed obesity-related type 2 diabetes, he said.

The on-again, off-again nature of the Maestro device’s stimulation serves another purpose: it prevents the vagus nerve’s gut signals from going silent--a communication loss that would likely prompt the central nervous system to find a compensatory workaround.

As a result, said Lea, the Maestro device appears to be safe and effective for long-term use, and unlike surgical alterations to the digestive system, reversible. Women who have had the device implanted and became pregnant were able to have it inactivated during their pregnancy, and then reactivated afterward, he said.

While the cost of the device has not yet been set, Lea said that getting the device implanted and activated will likely cost “somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000""--an amount that is more than gastric banding but less some of the most complex gastric bypass surgery.

The company has begun negotiations with private insurers, and the device has been been recognized as “exploratory” by the board that sets policy for Medicare reimbursements, and Lea expressed hope that some might agree to cover the procedure as early as later this year.

Can a cup of blueberries keep the doctor away? Maybe.

Researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 postmenopausal women ages 45 to 65 with high blood pressure. Half ate 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry powder (equivalent to a cup of blueberries) daily for eight weeks. The others consumed an identical-looking and tasting placebo.

The study, in The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that those who ate the blueberry preparation saw an average 5.1 percent decrease in systolic blood pressure (the top number) and a 6.3 percent decrease in diastolic pressure. Levels of nitric oxide, known to be involved in relaxing and widening blood vessels, increased significantly in the blueberry eaters. There were no significant changes in the placebo group.

The improvement, the scientists write, was moderate compared with that of blood pressure medicines. But, they say, eating blueberries in larger amounts or for longer periods could increase the effect.

Johnson, a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University, said she saw no reason for people to radically change their diet, but that if they are not eating blueberries, they might want to try them. “There is something very special about the composition of blueberries that is responsible for their effect on blood pressure,” she said. “Other fruits and plant extracts have not produced the same result.”",Blueberries May Lower Blood Pressure,2,health food claims

But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.

Normal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.

""The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,"" Lerman said in an interview. ""Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?""

This may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.

""Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,"" Lerman said. ""The trial and error approach is not optimal.""

Researchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user, she said. The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.

In some of the test groups, overall success rates were fairly low, Lerman noted, but the study was conducted during the Great Recession, a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone, regardless of which approach was used.

MONDAY, Jan. 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Higher vitamin D levels in patients with advanced colon cancer appear to improve response to chemotherapy and targeted anti-cancer drugs, researchers say.

""We found that patients who had vitamin D levels at the highest category had improved survival and improved progression-free survival, compared with patients in the lowest category,"" said lead author Dr. Kimmie Ng, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

Those patients survived one-third longer than patients with low levels of vitamin D -- an average 32.6 months, compared with 24.5 months, the researchers found.

The report, scheduled for presentation this week at the Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, adds more weight to suspicions that vitamin D might be a valuable cancer-fighting supplement.

However, colon cancer patients shouldn't try to boost vitamin D levels beyond the normal range, one expert said.

The study only found an association between vitamin D levels and colon cancer survival rates. It did not prove cause and effect.

Researchers for years have investigated vitamin D as a potential anti-cancer tool, but none of the findings have been strong enough to warrant a recommendation, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.

""Everyone comes to the same conclusion -- yes, there may be some benefit, but we really need to study it carefully so we can be certain there aren't other factors that make vitamin D look better than it is,"" Lichtenfeld said. ""These findings are interesting, and show that vitamin D may have a role in improving outcomes in cancer care.""

In this study, researchers measured blood levels of vitamin D in 1,043 patients enrolled in a phase 3 clinical trial comparing three first-line treatments for newly diagnosed, advanced colon cancer. All of the treatments involved chemotherapy combined with the targeted anti-cancer drugs bevacizumab and/or cetuximab.

Vitamin D is called the ""sunshine vitamin"" because human bodies produce it when the sun's ultraviolet rays strike the skin. It promotes the intestines' ability to absorb calcium and other important minerals, and is essential for maintaining strong, healthy bones, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

But vitamin D also influences cellular function in ways that could be beneficial in treating cancer, Ng said. For example, she said it appears to reduce cell growth, promote the death of diseased cells, and inhibit the formation of new blood vessels to feed cancerous tumors.

The study authors found that certain types of cancer patients tended to have lower vitamin D levels. These included people whose blood specimens were drawn in the winter and spring months, people who live in the northern and northeastern states, older adults, blacks, overweight or obese people, and those who had lower physical activity and were in worse physical condition.

The patients were divided into five groups based on vitamin D levels, ranging from low to high. After adjusting for prognosis and healthy behaviors, the researchers found that patients in the group with the highest levels of vitamin D lived about eight months longer on average than those in the group with the lowest levels.

""We had a lot of information on their tumor, their treatment and their survival times, and their diet and lifestyle,"" Ng said. ""That really allowed us to adjust for other potential factors that could influence what we're seeing.""

It also took longer for cancer to progress in people with higher vitamin D levels -- an average 12.2 months compared with about 10 months in the group with the lowest. No significant differences were seen with regard to the type of therapy the patients received.

This increase in progression-free survival is the most compelling evidence indicating that vitamin D makes a difference in colon cancer, said Dr. Smitha Krishnamurthi, an associate professor of hematology and oncology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.

""That is interesting because that's more of a cancer-specific endpoint as opposed to overall survival, which could be influenced by other factors like heart health,"" Krishnamurthi said.

Everyone should maintain healthy vitamin D levels anyway, to protect their bone health, Ng and Krishnamurthi said.

Based on this new study, Krishnamurthi said she would emphasize the importance of vitamin D for patients with colon cancer.

""They should take supplements to bring it into normal range, because we know it is good for bone health and it may have an anti-cancer effect,"" she said.

However, ""if someone has a normal vitamin D level, I wouldn't take supplements to increase it because we won't know the true effect on cancer until we see the results of a clinical trial,"" she said.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health funded the study. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

A new cancer drug, Opdivo, is working so well that pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb announced Monday it is stopping a trial in lung cancer two years ahead of schedule.

The trial compared Opdivo to Docetaxel, a type of chemo used for patients whose cancers have recurred after treatment. The study, in 234 patients, was the largest trial of the drug in lung cancer.

""We as a lung cancer community are incredibly excited about the activity of immunotherapy in various aspects of the disease,"" said Pasi Janne, director of the Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ""It's a disease where we're desperately looking for new therapies.""

Lung cancer kills more Americans than any other type of cancer, nearly 160,000 last year.

The new trial looked at a type of lung cancer called squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 20%-30% of lung cancers.

There have been no other recent treatment breakthroughs in squamous cancer, which most commonly occurs in smokers or former smokers, so this advance is particularly welcome, said Janne.

Janne, also a professor at Harvard Medical School, said more research is needed before lung cancer patients should be routinely treated with Opdivo, Keytruda or similar drugs.

""I think it's a little premature to start treating people today,"" he said, ""but I don't think we're far away from that.""

In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma, a type of skin cancer that used to be considered a death sentence.

Opdivo and others in its class work by removing a brake that cancer puts on the immune system. In some patients, just removing the brake is enough to allow the person's immune system to fight and contain the cancer. For other patients, researchers expect other drugs will be needed, too.

In addition to melanoma and lung cancer, this brake-release approach has been shown effective in early trials against bladder, kidney, head and neck cancers, and some blood cancers.

""We are feeling more and more confident that we are on the cusp of a treatment revolution,"" said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, which has its own, similar drug called Keytruda.

Merck is also studying Keytruda in people with advanced lung cancer to better understand how they are responding to treatment, what determines how well a patient will respond, and how to get good results for more patients, Perlmutter said.

Existing treatments – chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and so-called targeted therapies – can help beat back tumors, but once cancer has spread, it almost always returns. Immune therapy drugs offer the possibility that the immune system will keep cancer in check indefinitely.

But there are still a lot of unanswered questions about immune therapy.

""It is early days for the successes of immune therapy,"" said Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, a research arm of drug company Novartis, which is taking a different approach to turning the immune system against cancer. ""We're looking right now through a small keyhole at a very very large room, and we really don't know yet how big it will be.""",,2,Cancer

MONDAY, Jan. 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- School readiness isn't the only benefit young children can gain from Head Start. A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.

In their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren't in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.

""Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,"" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.

Federally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children's physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.

Health benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.

""This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,"" said Katz, who wasn't involved in the study.

Head Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. ""Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,"" he said.

""Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,"" Katz said. ""The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.""

Almost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.

For the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups. Whether those children were in another preschool program wasn't stated.

At the study's start, about one-third of the Head Start kids were obese or overweight, compared to 27 percent of those on Medicaid and less than 20 percent of kids not on Medicaid.

""Even though children in the Head Start group began the observation period more obese, equally overweight, and moreunderweight than children in the comparison groups, at the end of the observation period the initially obese and overweight Head Start children were substantially less obese andoverweight than the children in the comparison groups,"" the authors wrote.

Lumeng said an emphasis on good nutrition and exercise may partly explain the perceived Head Start advantage.

""Head Start programs must adhere to specific dietary guidelines,"" she said. ""The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children.""

In addition, Head Start requires a certain amount of active play each day, Lumeng said. ""Thus, children attending Head Start may be getting more opportunities for physical activity than other children,"" she explained.

The daily routine might translate into less TV time and more regular sleep schedules, she said. ""We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity,"" she added.

""It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns,"" she noted.

The report was published Jan. 12 online in the journal Pediatrics.

story_reviews_00719,"Just an avocado a day can significantly lower your cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, a new study shows.

Avocados are rich in so-called healthy fats and other nutrients and the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, shows the creamy fruit can work within weeks to lower cholesterol.



Just like olive oil and nuts, avocados have plaque-busting monounsaturated fatty acids, and the effects seem similar to all the benefits from a Mediterranean diet, the researchers said.

And it’s one more piece of evidence in favor of adding good fats to the diet.

Avocados can lower your cholesterol, a new study shows Today

“In the past, we used to substitute carbohydrate for saturated fat, and that would result in a low-fat diet,” said Penny Kris-Etherton, chair of the American Heart Association’s Nutrition Committee and distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University.

“Now we're seeing that it's better for people to have good fats in their diet at the expense of saturated fat. And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,” Kris-Etherton told NBC News.

Kris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans – all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.

It’s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.

Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

The two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.

Everyone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad” cholesterol) levels changed.

“All diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,” Kris-Etherton said.

Americans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.

While they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton’s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

LDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.

The volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.

In addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols – all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.

“We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,” Kris-Etherton said.

“All the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.”

The findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn’t get the extra oils.

Saturated fat – the kind found in meat and butter – has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.



“We studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,” Kris-Etherton said. “And certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein. I think we need to stay tuned for that. “

Americans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it’s easy to add.

“Consumers can include avocados in their diet in salads. They can include avocados on top of a sandwich, or in a sandwich. They can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip,” she said.

“I love guacamole and with my recipe, I'll use avocados, cilantro, lime juice and garlic... and then sometimes I'll put salsa in, or red pepper flakes.”

But like anything, too much of a good thing can be harmful. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.

“One avocado has around 200 to 250 calories. So I would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient-poor calories, which are so popular in the U.S. diet.,” Kris-Etherton said.

story_reviews_00721,"A new study claims that consuming one avocado a day as part of a moderate-fat diet could help lower bad cholesterol among people who are overweight or obese.

Share on Pinterest Consuming one avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol among overweight and obese individuals.

The researchers, including senior author Penny M. Kris-Etherton, PhD, distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, publish their findings in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

It is well known that avocados are high in fat, but the majority of an avocado's fat is monounsaturated, which is deemed a ""good"" type of fat. It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.

For their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or ""bad"" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.

The team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.

Every participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.

Prior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an ""average American diet,"" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.

From both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.

Moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL

The researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the ""bad"" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.

However, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.

What is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.

Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. ""That is not the real-world,"" says Kris-Etherton, ""so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.""

Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:

""We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.""

It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.

In January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.

New research finds that eating an avocado per day, as part of an overall diet rich in healthy fats, may help cut the bad kind cholesterol, known as LDL.

Researchers at Pennsylvania State University recruited 45 overweight participants who agreed to try three different types of cholesterol-lowering diets. Their study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

One was a low-fat diet that included lots of fruits, low-fat dairy, poultry, whole grains and small amounts of red meat.

The other two diets were moderately high in fat, with about 34 percent of total calories consumed per day coming from fat. The types of foods and meals were similar to the low-fat diet, but included more nuts and oils.

One of the moderately high-fat diets included a daily serving of one avocado.

In one sample meal plan, lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado, and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado.

The diets were similar in terms of macronutrients (like protein and fats) and calories. The only difference between the two was the avocado — the other diet had the same amount of fat from other sources.

At the end of the study, the researchers found that the avocado diet led to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol, compared with the other two diets.

To put the difference in perspective, the avocado diet decreased LDL cholesterol about 14 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Compare that with a decrease of about 7 mg/dL for the low-fat diet, and about a 8 mg/dl drop from the moderate-fat diet.

""I was surprised to see the added benefit [of the avocado],"" Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition scientist at Penn State and the lead author of the study, tells us."" It's something in the avocado"" other than just the fat composition, she says.

She says she'd like to do follow-up research to look at the bioactive compounds in avocados, which may explain the added reduction in LDL cholesterol in the study participants. It's also possible that the fiber in avocados plays a role in the cholesterol-lowering effect, she says.

But one caveat for anyone who loves guacamole: When it's served up with chips, the calories can add up. A mere half-cup of guacamole has about 200 calories all on its own.

Kris-Etherton's study was funded, in part, by the National Center for Research Resources, part of the National Institutes of Health.

It was also supported by a grant from the Hass Avocado Board, an industry group that the researchers say had no role in the design of the study or the interpretation of the data.

We asked Kris-Etherton if she would have published the results had there been no positive findings for the avocado.

""Oh, absolutely!"" she told us. The agreement was to publish no matter the results. And given the reduction in funds available for research, it's become increasingly common for researchers to carry out these kinds of industry-supported studies.",Bite Back At Bad Cholesterol: Eat An Avocado A Day,2,Diet studies

According to small study conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal, women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle. This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.

""While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,"" the researchers write in their study. ""One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.""

The study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.

Researchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan. They were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking. After undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to 100 if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings.

The researchers tested 13 of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle.

The brain scans showed that during the follicular stage, cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher-level cravings. However during the luteal phase -- after a woman ovulates and before her period -- only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking.

During the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest, which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal.

Previous studies have found women's monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues.

""This result emphasizes the need for gender-specific programs to quit smoking, as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women,"" the researchers conclude.

Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.

Active older people resemble much younger people physiologically, according to a new study of the effects of exercise on aging. The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.

Aging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time — in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays — or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.

This conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.

In the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King’s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.

They removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.

“We wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,” said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King’s College London.

To accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.

The scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist’s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.

The researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test’s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.

As it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people’s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.

And their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is “well within the norm reported for healthy young adults,” the study authors write.

Some aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.

But even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.

All in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.

“If you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age” of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, “it would be impossible.” On paper, they all look young.

Of course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.

But even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that “being physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person’s.”",How Exercise Keeps Us Young,3,New York Times

Nearly 20 years ago, Evans's lab worked to identify the molecular switch that turns on a whole series of bodily responses to eating, including digestion, absorption, the transfer of nutrients by the bloodstream and increased blood circulation, to name a few. In mice at least, fexaramine turns on that switch and sets off the same cascade of reactions without any side effects, Evans said. Other researchers are working on similar approaches, he said, but this drug, so far, passes harmlessly out of the intestine after doing its work.

""We can get that whole process of what a meal does without actually having the meal,"" he said.

The study also found other benefits. The drug contributed to development of brown fat, which helps burn calories, and relieves inflammation of cells in various tissues, which is the result of chronic obesity. It also reduced resistance to insulin, the hormone that helps cells absorb the glucose they use for energy. Many Type 2 diabetics become resistant to insulin and have to inject additional amounts.

But don't expect to be popping fexaramine any time soon. In the meantime, basic weight loss advice remains the same: fewer calories in, more calories expended by physical activity.

The drug is a next-generation version of a class of oft-prescribed antibiotics called macrolides, which are used to fight pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAPB).

ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT

CAPB is the leading cause of death emanating from an infection and is characterized by shortness of breath, cough and fever, with about 5-10 million cases in the United States per year.

An oral formulation of solithromycin was as effective as Bayer AG's moxifloxacin in evoking a clinical response at 72 hours after dosing — the study's main goal.

Data showed solithromycin actually outperformed moxifloxacin by a slight margin, Cempra said on Sunday.

The drug's ""impressive"" safety profile, particularly its low degree of gastrointestinal toxicity, drew praise from Baird's Brian Skorney, who raised his price target on the stock by $11 to $32.

Prior-generation macrolides have triggered safety concerns in the past, including Sanofi SA's telithromycin which was associated with liver toxicity, and Pfizer Inc's azithromycin, which has been linked with heart risk.

The unparalleled rate at which the oral version of solithromycin is absorbed in the blood, or its oral bioavailability, differentiates it from standard treatments, Chief Executive Prabha Fernandes told Reuters in an interview in November.

Jefferies analysts have previously noted a bioavailability of 80 percent for solithromycin versus 28 percent for azithromycin, a sign of superior effectiveness and lower rates of resistance.

North Carolina-based Cempra is also evaluating an intravenous formulation of solithromycin for CAPB.

The drug is also the first pediatric antibiotic-in-development in nearly three decades, according to Fernandes.

In the face of escalating antimicrobial resistance, investors have showered interest on the anti-superbug drugmaker, following Merck & Co's announcement to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc, as Big Pharma revives investment in antibiotic research.

While Cempra has said it plans to stay independent, the company is not averse to acquiring other molecules after filing to market solithromycin, Fernandes said.

""We can always get a gram-negative drug — that would be nice to add to the portfolio, to be a really full blown anti-infective company, and then we need to find a partner!""

Solithromycin is commercially licensed to Fujifilm Holdings Corp in Japan.

Becky Herry has tried nearly every drug available for melanoma.

A few years ago, that would have been a very short list. Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy.

For the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options.

The Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 — the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade — and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months.

The FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a ""breakthrough"" therapy.

Several other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies.

Melanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago. Doctors will present 288 melanoma studies, compared to only 62 a decade ago.

""The number of new melanoma therapies is sort of astonishing,"" says melanoma researcher Lynn Schuchter, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. ""The pace is unbelievable.""

More time, quality of life

No one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400.

But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good.

Unlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation.

""The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,"" Turnham says.

Many of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's ""cloaking device,"" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center.

Other drugs — such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib — target growth signals within cancer cells.

New drugs have fewer side effects

Herry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab.

Although her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab.

The most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments.

Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says.

When the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years.

At the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year.

Other studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results.

A small study of 86 melanoma patients combined ipilumumab and nivolumab, allowing some patients to take the drugs sequentially, and others to take them at the same time. In a subgroup of patients who combined the drugs at the highest dose, 53% saw their tumors shrink by 80% or more, says study co-author Jedd Wolchok of New York's Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

In a study of 122 patients, a Genentech immunotherapy shrank tumors in 39% of patients whose tumors made lots of a particular protein but only 13% of patients whose tumors lacked this marker. While many of these patients had melanoma, the drug — a manmade antibody to block a protein called PD-L1 — also helped control tumors in the lung, kidney, bladder and other organs, Herbst says.

None of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free.

Ipilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers.

""Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'"" Turnham says. ""Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients.""

Turnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who ""woke up bleeding every morning"" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later.

Drugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says.

""If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.""",New drugs improve options for melanoma patients,5,Cancer
story_reviews_00729,"A new asthma drug being developed by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may help patients whose condition is not well controlled by existing medicines, according to the results of a small clinical trial released Tuesday.

In the 12-week study, the number of asthma attacks or other outbreaks of symptoms decreased by 87 percent in those getting the drug, dupilumab, compared with those getting a placebo.

Other measures of lung function and disease control also improved, according to the study results, which were published online Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the annual meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.

Dupilumab blocks the action of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, two inflammatory chemicals made by the body that are believed to contribute to asthma. Sanofi and Regeneron say there are also preliminary signs dupilumab works against the skin condition atopic dermatitis, suggesting it can be blocking a biological pathway that contributes to multiple allergic conditions.","New Drug May Help Some Asthmatics, Study Finds",4,New York Times
story_reviews_00730,"(Reuters) - A new type of asthma drug meant to attack the underlying causes of the respiratory disease slashed episodes by 87 percent in a mid-stage trial, making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease, researchers said on Tuesday.

“Overall, these are the most exciting data we’ve seen in asthma in 20 years,” said Dr. Sally Wenzel, lead investigator for the 104-patient study of dupilumab, an injectable treatment being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi.

The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists.

Although far larger trials will be needed to confirm findings from the “proof of concept” study, researchers expressed optimism. They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.

Results of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.

The medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.

“We have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn’t get at the underlying causes,” Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.

The drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).

HITS ELUSIVE TARGETS

Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.

The trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.

Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.

All patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.

Throughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.

After the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.

“By end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,” Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.

Wenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.

Regeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.

Dupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.

Atopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.

“This asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said in an interview.

Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.

But the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a “limited subpopulation of patients with asthma” because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.

“We do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,” the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.","Regeneron, Sanofi asthma drug seen as potential game changer",3,Reuters Health
story_reviews_00731,"They made some interesting observations about gene mutations that were already known to cause heart diseases, but the Del Sontros offered the possibility of discovering an entirely new genetic pathway to heart disease. Now, eight family members have joined the study, and Dr. Biesecker is searching for more.

Even so, finding the tiny, troublemaking genetic glitches in the family’s genes is an intimidating task. There are 30,000 genes in each person’s DNA, and each gene is can be made up of a string of hundreds of DNA letters and can harbor variations.

Most of the variations are meaningless. In the entire DNA — which contains genes and regions that control genes — there are six billion DNA letters to check. To figure out what DNA changes might be important, the researchers are comparing the DNA sequences of Rick Del Sontro and his family with those of others in the study, looking for genetic changes that occur in every member of the Del Sontro family who has heart disease but that are not generally found in healthy people.

Dr. Biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success. He and his colleagues know the gene mutation in the Del Sontro family must be rare. Otherwise, lots of people would have early heart disease but no obvious risk factors. To keep the focus on truly rare mutations, the researchers are excluding those that are present in both members of the Del Sontro family and 3 percent or more of the other study participants. That strategy alone, Dr. Biesecker said, has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes.

The researchers are now searching for culprits among genes that remain — a search that could take years. Or the change might be in a poorly understood region of DNA that controls genes rather than in a gene itself. Researchers’ ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort. So the researchers are hoping the Del Sontro family’s heart disease is caused by a mutated gene.

“Our main job is to find the gene,” Dr. Biesecker said.

Still, Mr. Del Sontro is preparing for the worst. He has life insurance and long-term care insurance.

“I keep waiting for the day when I have shortness of breath,” he said.

When his heart disease was first diagnosed four and a half years ago, Mr. Del Sontro, now 50, told his cardiologist he wanted to run one more Bay to Breakers race, a century-old 12-kilometer race in San Francisco. His doctor told him absolutely not, saying, “You are the kind of guy we will read about who dies during the race of a massive heart attack.” Mr. Del Sontro could still exercise, his cardiologist said, but no more than 45 minutes a day.",Seeking Clues to Heart Disease in DNA of an Unlucky Family,3,heart disease

THURSDAY, May 9, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report positive results in early testing of a wireless pacemaker that's placed in the heart instead of being connected to it via wires from the upper chest.

There are still many questions regarding the pacemaker, produced by Nanostim Inc. It's only been implanted in a few dozen people who were studied for a matter of months, limiting information about its long-term use and safety. It's also not clear when the pacemaker may be publicly available, and its cost is unknown. And the existing version of the device won't work for most pacemaker patients because it lacks some key features.

Still, a new company-funded study shows that ""this is now a possibility"" that could reduce infections and the severity of pacemaker surgery, said study author Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Service at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. ""This is going to be the future,"" he said.

Pacemakers zap the heart with low levels of electricity when the heartbeat becomes too fast, too slow or too irregular. Some are combined with defibrillators, which give the heart a major jolt when needed.

Currently, pacemakers include two components: a battery-powered generator that produces the electrical ""prompts"" that the wires deliver to the heart when needed, Reddy said. These wires can break or become infected, he explained, making the idea of a wire-free pacemaker appealing.

The new pacemaker is about the size of a AAA battery and provides jolts to one chamber of the heart, Reddy said. Most people with pacemakers require jolts to both chambers, so the pacemaker in its current form wouldn't work for them.

In the new study, researchers implanted the pacemaker in 32 people for the first time through a puncture in the skin; in 10 patients, they had to reposition it. The researchers reported positive results at up to three months. However, one patient died of a stroke while convalescing after suffering a heart injury during implantation and another had the pacemaker replaced with a defibrillator.

Why get a wire-free pacemaker? ""For patients with heart problems, this could potentially mean fewer infections related to leads and less discomfort during the implant procedure,"" Reddy said. And children who get pacemakers wouldn't face chest scarring, he added.

Dr. Saman Nazarian, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said the findings are promising and ""the new technology has enormous potential."" He expects the pacemaker ""will likely be utilized for some select patients"" after more testing.

Still, he said, the new device will probably be more expensive than other pacemakers, and may pose special risks of its own.

Dr. Harish Doppalapudi, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, added that there are unanswered questions regarding replacement of the new pacemakers.

""When the battery of the implanted leadless pacemaker is exhausted, a new implant is necessary, with all the potential risks associated with this,"" Doppalapudi said. ""It is not known if it will be feasible to safely retrieve the old device. If the old device is left in place, it is not known what the long-term effects of this will be.""

Study author Reddy has received grant funding from Nanostim, and works for the company as a consultant. He also has received stock options from the company.

The study was to be presented Wednesday at the Heart Rhythm Society annual meeting in Denver. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

A new genetic test to gauge the aggressiveness of prostate cancer may help tens of thousands of men each year decide whether they need to treat their cancer right away or can safely monitor it.

The new test, which goes on sale Wednesday, joins another one that recently came on the market. Both analyze multiple genes in a biopsy sample and give a score for aggressiveness, similar to tests used now for certain breast and colon cancers.

Doctors say tests like these have the potential to curb a major problem in cancer care — overtreatment. Prostate tumors usually grow so slowly they will never threaten a man's life, but some prove fatal and there is no reliable way now to tell which ones will. Treatment with surgery, radiation or hormone blockers isn't needed in most cases and can cause impotence or incontinence, yet most men are afraid to skip it.

""We're not giving patients enough information to make their decision,"" said Dr. Peter Carroll, chairman of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""You can shop for a toaster"" better than for prostate treatment, he said.

A study he led of the newest test — the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score — is set for discussion Wednesday at an American Urological Association meeting in San Diego.

The results suggest the test could triple the number of men thought to be at such low risk for aggressive disease that monitoring is a clearly safe option. Conversely, the test also suggested some tumors were more aggressive than doctors had believed.

Independent experts say such a test is desperately needed but that it's unclear how much information this one adds or whether it will be enough to persuade men with low-risk tumors to forgo treatment, and treat it only if it gets worse. Only 10 percent who are candidates for monitoring choose it now.

""The question is, what's the magnitude of difference that would change the patient's mind?"" said Dr. Bruce Roth, a cancer specialist at Washington University in St. Louis.

One man may view a 15 percent chance that his tumor is aggressive as low risk ""but someone else might say, 'Oh my God, let's set the surgery up tomorrow,'"" he said. ""I don't think it's a slam dunk.""

Also unknown: Will insurers pay for the expensive test without evidence it leads to better care or saves lives?

The newest test was developed by Genomic Health Inc., which has sold a similar one for breast cancer since 2004. Doctors at first were leery of it until studies in more groups of women proved its value, and the same may happen with the prostate test, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer.

The company will charge $3,820 for the prostate test and says it can save money by avoiding costlier, unnecessary treatment. Another test for assessing prostate cancer risk that came out last summer — Prolaris by Myriad Genetics Inc. — sells for $3,400.

Both companies can sell the tests without Food and Drug Administration approval under separate rules that govern lab diagnostics. Myriad Genetics has published nine studies on Prolaris involving more than 3,000 patients. Genomic Health has not published any results on the prostate test, another thing that makes doctors wary. Yet it has a track record from its breast cancer test.

About 240,000 men in the U.S. are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, and about half are classified as low risk using current methods. Doctors now base risk estimates on factors such as a man's age and how aggressive cells look from biopsies that give 12 to 14 tissue samples. But tumors often are spread out and vary from one spot to the other.

""Unless you can be sure your biopsy has hit the most aggressive part that's in the prostate, you can't be sure"" how accurate your risk estimate is, explained Dr. Eric Klein, chief of urology at the Cleveland Clinic, who led early development of the Oncotype prostate cancer test.

For one study, researchers used prostates removed from 440 men. They measured the activity of hundreds of genes thought to be involved in whether the cancer spread beyond the prostate or proved fatal. A second study of biopsies from 167 patients narrowed it down to 81 genes, and researchers picked 17 that seemed to predict aggressiveness no matter the location in the tumor.

A third study used single needle-biopsy samples from 395 UCSF patients scheduled to have their prostates removed. The gene test accurately predicted the aggressiveness of their cancer once doctors were able to see the whole prostate after surgery.

Using one current method, 37 of the 395 men would have been called very low risk and good candidates for monitoring. Adding the gene test put 100 men into that category, said another study leader, Dr. Matthew Cooperberg of UCSF. The gene test shifted about half of the men into either a lower or a higher risk category.

""It went both ways — that was the remarkable thing. In any category of risk it added independent information compared to the standard criteria we use today,"" Carroll said. ""More work needs to be done, but, in my opinion, this is a very good start.""

However, Dr. Kevin McVary, chairman of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and a spokesman for the Urological Association, said the test must be validated in more men before it can be widely used.

""It's not there yet,"" he said.

UCSF just got a federal grant to see how men choose treatments and whether this test might sway them.

""We throw all these numbers at them. Are they really going to make a better decision?"" Cooperberg said.

Dean Smith, 60, a retired marketing executive from Mill Valley, Calif., is following his doctor's advice to monitor the cancer he was diagnosed with in March. He said a gene test may have made him more comfortable with that decision.

At least six of his friends suffered side effects ranging from urinary leakage to inability to have sex after having their prostates removed.

""I would suspect that having cancer and having to live with it would be very difficult for them,"" but it doesn't bother him, Smith said. ""I will die from something other than prostate cancer, I guarantee you.""",Gene test may help guide prostate cancer treatment,5,Associated Press

THURSDAY, May 2, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- An implanted device that monitors brain activity may offer a way to predict seizures in people with uncontrolled epilepsy, a small pilot study suggests.

The findings, reported online May 2 in the journal Lancet Neurology, are based on only 15 patients, and the device worked far better in some than others. But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.

""We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,"" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital in Australia.

The prospect of being able to predict seizures is ""very exciting,"" he said, in part because it's the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people's quality of life.

If people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain's normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person's perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.

Epilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don't keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 ""disabling"" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.

Cook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.

That unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a ""high likelihood"" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a ""moderate"" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)

For the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.

Over those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.

There are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.

""This study is an important first step,"" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. ""The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.""

Mehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.

It may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.

But any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.

Still, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.

An implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.

In real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.

But what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.

The study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology. Several of Cook's co-researchers work for the company.

A breakthrough in helping the body to produce more insulin could make tedious injections of the hormone history.

In type 2 diabetes, the body gradually loses its ability to make enough insulin to keep up with the sugar coming in from the diet. Eventually, the overwhelmed system leaves these sugars, in the form of glucose, to build up in the blood, which can lead to obesity, damage the heart, and cause other metabolic problems.

And while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren’t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. But despite decades of research, scientists haven’t found a better way to address the problem.

MORE: Half of Diabetes Cases Are Undiagnosed

Now, researchers working with mice at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute report in the journal Cell that they have discovered a hormone, betatrophin, that can prompt the body to generate more insulin-producing beta cells and, if the work is confirmed, the hormone could potentially do away with the need for regular insulin shots.

“We don’t understand the cause of type 2 diabetes, but everyone agrees that having more beta cells is better,” says Douglas Melton, senior author of the paper and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. “No one doubts that’s not a good idea.”

MORE: Should You Take Statins? Study Says Heart Benefits Outweigh Diabetes Risk

It’s an exciting breakthrough in diabetes research, which for many years was focused on finding ways to externally supplement the body’s waning insulin levels. That’s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body’s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn’t be made to work again. What’s more, they also surmised that only a specialized set of beta cells were equipped to make insulin, and that once diabetes set in, too few of these cells remained to pump out the critical hormone.

Melton, however, whose work focuses on understanding how stem cells might enhance beta cell production, admits that he is “obsessed” with the insulin-making cells, and reported in 2007 that all beta cells appeared to have the ability to produce insulin. His pursuit of a better understanding of this population, and the forces that cause them to falter in diabetes, led his team to the discovery of betatrophin.

In animal studies, mice that were treated with another compound that compromised their ability to respond to insulin suddenly revved up production of more beta cells to compensate, and Melton’s team was able to isolate the hormone responsible – betatrophin. Over the course of a few weeks, mice bred to develop diabetes but injected with betatrophin were increased their beta cell population by 17 times. “I was impressed by the fact that the number of beta cells in the mice doubled in one week with one injection,” says Melton. “That’s a huge difference.”

What’s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control.

In theory, if the same results occur in people, it’s possible that those on the verge of developing diabetes might never progress to develop the disease, since the high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to tissues and lead the body to become less responsive to insulin could be avoided. It’s also possible that diabetics could lower their dependence on insulin and might even be able to wean themselves off of the injection altogether if their beta cell production is robust enough to provide the insulin they need.

“Even if it doesn’t address insulin resistance, what [betatrophin] will do is lower blood sugar, and anything that lowers blood sugar can make you healthier,” he says.

More work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however. John Anderson, president of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association, says “It’s very promising and opens up new avenues of research, but we are a long way from replacing insulin, or a cure, or even knowing how this [hormone] will work in human tissue.”

Those concerns aren’t lost on Melton, who also recognizes that more research is needed to confirm that betatrophin may benefit patients. “I am aware of the fact that given our level of ignorance, everything seems simple and straightforward,” he says. “But I am prepared to have it become more complicated.”",Newly Discovered Hormone Could Yield New Treatment For Diabetes,3,Diabetes

MONDAY, April 15, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Adding computer-aided detection to mammograms finds more early, noninvasive cancers and helps detect invasive cancers at earlier stages, according to a large new study. But the jury's still out as to how worthwhile the extra technology is overall.

For one thing, computer-aided detection (CAD) increases the amount of diagnostic testing among women who turn out not to have breast cancer. And the technology makes mammograms more expensive.

CAD is becoming more widespread, said Dr. Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, Davis, and lead study author. ""It's an add-on and now is used in probably three-quarters of U.S. mammograms,"" he said.

Computer-aided detection systems use a digitized mammogram image from either a traditional film mammogram or a digitally acquired mammogram, according to the American College of Radiology. The CAD software looks for areas that may indicate cancer so the radiologist can then look more closely at the mammogram.

Although it has rapidly become part of mammogram screening, Fenton said there is limited and conflicting research on its effect.

Under Medicare payment rates, doctors get an additional $11 for adding computer-aided detection to a mammogram, said Fenton, citing Medicare data. The Medicare rate for a film mammogram is $81 while a digital mammogram is $139.

His team evaluated more than 409,000 mammograms -- with and without computer-aided detection -- from more than 163,000 women aged 67 to 89. The study is published in the April 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Fenton took data from a large U.S. epidemiology database from 2001 to 2006. During that time, computer-aided detection use increased from 3.6 percent to 60.5 percent. Now, with about 75 percent of mammograms adding it, it is even more common, Fenton said.

""In our study, we assessed its impact in the Medicare program,"" he said. The researchers compared the results when mammograms included CAD to when they did not.

When computer-aided detection was used, doctors found a greater number of early cancers known as ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. ""But the [overall] rate of invasive breast cancer diagnosis was no different with or without CAD,"" Fenton said.

However, among the women who did have invasive cancer, computer-aided detection was linked with a greater likelihood of finding the cancer while it was stage 1 or 2 compared to stage 3 or 4, they found.

""CAD was also associated with increased diagnostic testing among women who turned out not to have breast cancer,"" he said. These women, because breast cancer was suspected, had to be called back for additional tests, such as repeat mammograms or biopsies.

So is the new computer technology worth it? ""Our study doesn't answer that question; it raises that question,"" Fenton said. The findings, he said, are a mix of potential good news and not so good. The additional tests that turn out to be unnecessary, because no cancer is found, are not desirable, he said.

Some of the very early cancers diagnosed in older women, he noted, may not have caused them a problem during their lifetime. But doctors can't say with certainty which ones will progress and which ones will not.

""Women should recognize that CAD comes with some potential risks,"" Fenton said. ""It has the potential risk of a false-positive mammogram. If you are an older woman, [there is] the risk of overtreatment of noninvasive lesions.""

Dr. Daniel Kopans, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and senior radiologist in the breast imaging division at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides additional information to doctors and women, but has some limitations. He was not involved with the study.

""The good news is the use of CAD was related to finding invasive cancers at smaller sizes and earlier stages than before the CAD era,"" said Kopans, also a member of the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Commission. ""There should be no argument that finding invasive cancers at a smaller size and earlier stage is beneficial,"" he said, as they are more likely to be cured.

While he calls finding more DCIS with computer-aided detection also ''likely a good thing,"" he acknowledged the debate about the possibility that a very early cancer in an elderly woman may not cause a problem in her lifetime. Although the treatment of DCIS is debated among experts, Kopans said, ""In my mind, it is always worth it to find additional cancers.""

One limitation of the study, he said, is that the researchers cannot say for sure it was the computer-aided detection that made the difference. Other factors could have played a role, such as the radiologists becoming more experienced, he said.

story_reviews_00737,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Doctors can use a patient’s abdominal CT scans to also check for signs of the bone-weakening disease osteoporosis, according to a new study.

The researchers, who published their findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, compared patients’ CT scans to their dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is traditionally used to diagnose osteoporosis.

“What we found is that there is pretty good correlation,” said the study’s lead author Dr. Perry Pickhardt, professor of radiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison.

The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients’ CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.

In an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.

In this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.

The panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there’s no recommendation for men of any age.

Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.

‘INCIDENTALOPOROSIS?’

For the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.

Overall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.

The researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.

Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit “incidentaloporosis” - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses “discovered” while doctors were looking for something else.

At the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.

Pickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.

“Obviously it’s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that’s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn’t run that risk,” he said.

CT v. DXA

Majumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don’t include the hip - like a DXA would.

A DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation.

Dr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she’d want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan.

“I don’t think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing. I think it will identify patients who are at a higher risk and need more testing,” said Hull, who wasn’t involved with the new research.

SUNDAY, April 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A method designed to target, freeze and destroy a tumor's cellular function seems effective in combating lung tumors, a small ongoing study finds.

At least in the short-run -- meaning three months after the procedure -- the intervention known as ""cryoablation"" appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere, preliminary results suggest.

However, some patients developed new tumors in that time period, the researchers noted.

The study authors cautioned that while the initial findings are encouraging, the treatment should not be seen as a cure for this type of metastatic (spreading) lung disease. Rather, they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches, the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time.

""'Promising' is the perfect way to describe our findings,"" said study lead author Dr. David Woodrum, an interventional radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""But whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long-term results of this trial, which is still under way. At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.""

Woodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. Funding for their work was provided by Galil Medical, a medical device manufacturer based in Arden Hills, Minn.

Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The U.S. National Cancer Institute points out that while cryoablation (also known as cryosurgery) is a well-known practice, researchers are still in the process of assessing its long-term benefits.

The procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors, the researchers noted. Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.

To date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.

The targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being ""small to medium in size.""

The procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.

The result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.

Among five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.

The authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.

The team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul.

""It would be overreaching to say that we're curing cancer with this,"" Woodrum said. ""But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.""

For his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are ""not incredibly novel,"" given that the procedure has been around for years.

""And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,"" he added. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.

""While I've done cryoablation myself in the past, it's not what I typically do,"" Carbone noted. ""Stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn't require general anesthesia, so that's what I'd tend to do, although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient's situation and symptoms. But there's no situation in which cryoablation would be the only theoretical option.""

Eating walnuts may reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes in women, a large new study concludes.

Previous studies have suggested an inverse relationship between tree nut consumption and diabetes. Though the findings are correlational, walnuts are uniquely high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which may be of particular value in Type 2 diabetes prevention.

The scientists, writing in the April issue of The Journal of Nutrition, used dietary and health data on 138,000 women participating in a large continuing study of women’s health. Beginning in 1999 they collected data on walnut consumption, and followed the women for the next 10 years. They found 5,930 cases of Type 2 diabetes.

Women who ate walnuts tended to weigh less, consume more fish and exercise more than those who did not. But researchers controlled for these and many other factors, and found that compared with women who ate no walnuts, those who consumed 8 ounces of walnuts or more a month reduced their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 24 percent.

“There’s been a lot of research on nuts in general in relation to cardiovascular health,” said the senior author, Dr. Frank B. Hu, a professor of medicine at Harvard. “This is the first on walnuts and diabetes. Walnuts may have some unique benefits.”

WEDNESDAY, April 3, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A new class of sleep medications appears to help people fall asleep without causing grogginess the next day, researchers say.

These new medications -- known as dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORA) -- target a more specific region of the brain than popular sleep drugs such as Ambien and Lunesta, promoting sleep without affecting learning and memory (also called ""cognition""), according to the new research.

""We've shown that these compounds improve sleep at doses that don't impact cognition,"" said Jason Uslaner, lead author of a study published in the April 3 issue of Science Translational Medicine. Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.

Merck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

More than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.

But widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.

Lunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.

About 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.

The appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they ""target a system that's more specific for sleep.""

That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.

Uslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.

DORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.

In each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the ""control"" drugs.

This is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?

Those questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.

Experts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.

story_reviews_00741,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A study in rats and monkeys suggests an experimental Merck & Co sleep drug may help induce sleep without causing the memory loss and attention problems sometimes seen in the commonly used drugs Ambien and Lunesta, company researchers said on Wednesday.

Experiments in animals suggest Merck’s sleep drug Suvorexant, now before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may avoid these side effects, the company said.

Insomnia affects about 10 percent of U.S. adults, and roughly a third of these individuals take drugs to help them sleep. Most sleep aids, including Sanofi’s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals’ Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.

“These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.

GABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.

“When you hit those, you don’t just hit the sleep system,” John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.

Suvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.

Orexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.

For this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.

“How impaired would they be?” Renger said.

To test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.

The team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.

In the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.

Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.

“Are DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,” Mignot wrote.

So far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.

The most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness. No serious drug-related side effects have been reported.",Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study,3,Reuters Health
story_reviews_00742,"From a crusty baguette to a big thick steak, some foods may be hard to digest, particularly as we age. Enzyme capsules taken before a meal can relieve discomfort by helping the body to break down problem foods, say companies that sell the pills. Doctors say some enzyme supplements work well, but others need more human studies.

Digestive enzymes are proteins that work like scissors to break down foods. The pancreas, where many of these enzymes are made, can slow down as we age, which can result in bloating and other gastrointestinal discomfort, says Steven Lamm, clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine and a paid consultant to Enzymedica Inc., a Venice, Fla., company that sells enzyme capsules. Gastroenterologists say it is true the pancreas can slow down with age, but gastrointestinal upsets can be from many causes.

Prescription enzymes are often given to patients who have ""pancreatic insufficiency,"" in which the pancreas doesn't make enough enzymes to digest food, doctors say. But many people with milder gastrointestinal problems—such as gas and bloating—are turning to enzymatic dietary supplements for relief. Sales of over-the-counter digestive enzymes in the U.S. hit $136 million in the past 12 months, up 4% from two years ago, according to Spins LLC, a Schaumburg, Ill., market-research firm.

The concept of an over-the-counter enzyme blend seems ""reasonable"" but ""there are not high-quality, well-designed studies"" that prove they work in humans, says Lin Chang, director of the digestive health and nutrition clinic at the University of California in Los Angeles.

Also, says David Whitcomb, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, many over-the-counter enzymes are made in fungi—resulting in proteins that digest food efficiently but haven't been tested for humans.

The first over-the-counter enzymes to hit the U.S. market had narrow applications. Lactase, an enzyme that digests a sugar in milk and is lacking in lactose-intolerant people, went on sale in pill form in the 1980s. In 1991, alpha-galactosidase, which aids in digesting beans, cabbage and broccoli, appeared under the brand name Beano, now sold by Medtech Products Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y. Lactase works well, doctors say, and at least four small, published human trials have found the main ingredient in Beano can reduce gas after a meal of beans.

Many newer products aimed at a broader spectrum of foods and digestive concerns are now on the market, but they haven't been tested in human trials. Enzymedica's Digest Gold is a blend of enzymes, including proteases for digesting protein; amylase, for starches and lipase, for fat. Mega-Zyme, sold by a North American unit of Germany's Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. in Green Bay, Wis., contains a powerful enzyme blend the company's website says can ""help relieve occasional gas and bloating.""

Neither company has done clinical trials on its enzyme products, though Enzymedica says it is planning human trials. Both companies say lab tests show their enzymes do what they are expected to do. For example, says Jeremy Appleton, a naturopathic doctor at Schwabe, proteases are tested to make sure they efficiently break down proteins. He says Schwabe doesn't know of any side effects but adds people with fungal allergies should use the products with caution.

A number of products, such Enzymedica's Gluten Ease 2x, which hit the market last year, are aimed at people who get sick from eating gluten. Humans haven't evolved with the ability to fully digest gluten, says Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In most people, gluten doesn't cause problems, but in people with celiac disease, it causes an autoimmune reaction, Dr. Fasano says. People with ""gluten sensitivity"" can have symptoms such as stomach aches, joint pain, fatigue and headaches, he adds.

Enzymedica's website notes the product isn't for celiac patients, who need to avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Dr. Fasano agrees, but says patients with gluten sensitivity could try the enzymes. But since the enzymes can work slowly, he says he is skeptical the capsules will work fast enough for many patients, who experience symptoms in minutes or hours.

Enzymedica founder Tom Bohager says lab tests show the product works quickly—with an average of 60% large gluten molecules broken down in a half-hour and 75% at 90 minutes. The company says customers have reported only occasional side effects—such as stomach cramping. In the case of cramps, the company recommends reducing the dose.

MONDAY, March 25, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental breath test, designed to quickly identify patients suffering from heart failure simply by analyzing the contents of a single exhaled breath, has demonstrated promise in early trials, a team of researchers says.

The investigators stressed that their evaluation is based on a small group of participating patients, and that more extensive research will have to be done to confirm their initial success.

But by subjecting a patient's breath to a rigorous but fast analysis of the hundreds of so-called volatile organic compounds contained therein, the study team said it has so far been able to correctly diagnose heart failure among newly hospitalized patients with a 100 percent accuracy.

""Every individual has a breath print that differentiates them from other people, depending on what's going on in their body,"" explained study lead author Dr. Raed Dweik, a staff physician in the department of pulmonary, allergy and critical care medicine with the Respiratory Institute at Cleveland Clinic. ""And that print can tell us a lot about a person, what they've been exposed to and what disease they have,"" he added.

""That's what makes the new field of breath testing so promising, because it is non-intrusive, so there is no risk involved,"" Dweik said. ""And you can do it anywhere, in a clinic, in a hospital, anywhere.""

The findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

The study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart's pumping action grows gradually weaker over time.

Currently, a diagnosis of heart failure comes from a variety of factors, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.

In the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.

Of those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of ""acute decompensated heart failure"" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.

Within two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon ""mass spectrometry"" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.

The result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.

Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital.

""If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,"" he said. ""But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,"" he noted.

""So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,"" Fonarow said. ""But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.""

Study author Dweik added that the test is ""theoretically cheap. But of course we're still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept. There is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available.""

Hip replacement involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. In a break from past practice, some surgeons prefer to cut into the joint from the front. (ANTHONY UNGER/ANTHONY UNGER)

Over the past two decades, the number of Americans having total hip replacements has more than doubled, to more than 300,000 a year. Though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane, recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous, painful and lengthy.

The surgery is extensive: As its name suggests, it involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. Typically, surgeons enter the joint from the rear, which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage. But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial.

Anthony Unger, medical director at the Institute of Bone and Joint Health at Sibley Memorial Hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, says the anterior approach is “truly minimally invasive.” Unger, who has done about 4,000 hip replacements over 26 years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years, says “patients have better overall functionality, can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won’t dislocate.”

But, as with many transitions in medical techniques, some surgeons have been reluctant to change. Although agencies and hospitals don’t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used, Unger says that, based on statistics from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, only 20 percent of its members choose the anterior approach.

Joshua Jacobs, a vice president of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University in Chicago, says the AAOS doesn’t “endorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another.” Jacobs prefers the posterior approach, which he says has been reliable for him.

He says that while he’s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach, he’s “not aware of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other.” What’s key is that “surgeons need to do the approach they’re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes.”

Teetering ‘like Chaplin’

A study by Unger in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2011 found that with the anterior procedure, there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach.

Others surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy, which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago.

With the anterior approach, Bollinger says, “we can take

X-rays during the operation, to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it, when necessary.” Many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible.

Although surgeons can also take X-rays during the posterior procedure, it is much more difficult, and they wait until patients are in the recovery room, where, Bollinger says, “there’s not much that can be done.” He explains that while the body “tolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well, if a new hip gets dislocated, it’s often because it’s not in perfectly.”

The anterior approach offers other benefits.

Robert Saunders, a nurse at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., sees about 200 hip replacement patients a year. He says that “nurses love the anterior approach” because there’s less worry about dislocating the joint. “With the posterior approach, we have to spread patients’ legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place. If they want to move or roll over, they can’t,” he says.

Saunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy, which can start the same day as the surgery. “Those who’ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain, since, when they sit up, they’re right on top the incision,” he explains.

Patrick Kennelly, a physical therapist with Smartherapy in Chevy Chase, says people who have the anterior procedure “don’t feel so weak, because their hip muscles haven’t been cut. If they’ve had the posterior procedure, even if they don’t consciously feel weak, they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like [Charlie] Chaplin.”

Cautious surgeons

Given benefits such as these, why haven’t more surgeons switched methods? Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Also, he says, they work in a “very high-stress, high-liability environment. For this reason, new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care, and in some cases, not at all.”

Unger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods. Besides his study, there have only been a few others. One, a prospective, randomized study by William Barrett, an orthopedic surgeon in the Seattle area, compared the two approaches in a peer-reviewed paper he presented at the 2012 annual AAOS meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach.

Another obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch, they face time and cost constraints. They must get training in classes and cadaver labs, and the learning curve can be steep. Unger says his was relatively short — about 20 cases. Others say it took about 50 cases.

And this creates economic issues. “If you’re a busy surgeon, you have a volume to maintain,” Bollinger says, “and it’s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period.”

Christopher Chen, a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at Alta Bates Summit, adds that most doctors “still use the posterior approach because it’s the one they were taught.” And, he says, the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best.

Most surgeons don’t profit from choosing one approach over another, Chen says. “If there is a financial incentive” for promoting the newer technique, he says, “it is that more patients will want the anterior approach, so that the surgeon does more surgeries, and therefore collects more professional fees for that.”

William Hamilton, who operates at the Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic at Inova Mt. Vernon Hospital, trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year-long hip and knee replacement fellowship program. Hamilton says that “during this time, they’re taught both approaches.” But he adds that “since 2009, of the 13 fellows he trained, 12 use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices.”

Hamilton says that “a decade ago, very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach. Now, several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it. So when students leave and begin their practices, it’s no longer foreign to them.”

Hamilton, who has performed 1,100 anterior procedures and strongly supports the method, says that despite growing interest, “it will take a generation of new surgeons” before use of the anterior approach is widespread.

Patients aren’t informed

Many patients aren’t aware of the option. The case of Daniel Ellsberg — who in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a secret study about U.S. involvement in Vietnam — is instructive. His hip had been hurting for about a year, and when he decided to have surgery, his primary-care physician recommended a respected surgeon. Just days before the operation last July, a friend told him about the anterior approach.

“I’d never heard of it, and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it. I called the surgeon’s office, learned he did the posterior procedure, asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one, and my experience was amazing. The same day as the operation, I walked down the hall with a walker. I was home in three days, and a week later, [I] walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane. In a month, I bodysurfed at the beach,” says Ellsberg, who is 81 .

Margot Machol, who is two decades younger and lives in Washington, had both hips replaced — the first with the posterior procedure several years ago, the second with the anterior procedure last October. Unger performed both surgeries.

“After the first, I needed pain medicine when I came home from the hospital. Also, I had a long list of restrictions of what I could and couldn’t do so the hip wouldn’t pop out. For six weeks, I had to sleep on my back, couldn’t cross my legs and wasn’t able to drive.

“After the second, I didn’t take any pain pills once I was home, slept on my side soon after the surgery, had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks. I even wanted to ski over Christmas, because I felt fine,” Machol says.

story_reviews_00745,"LanaLanglois / Featurepics.com Tofu is one soyfood that may help at least some women survive lung cancer better, a study finds

Soy foods, long shown to help lower the risk of cancer, may also help people survive at least some forms of cancer better, researchers reported on Monday.

They found that Chinese women who ate the most soy were also less likely to die of lung cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer across the world.

The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, lends support to the idea that adding soy foods to the diet can help people in multiple ways, says Dr. Jyoti Patel, a lung cancer specialist at Northwestern University in Chicago, who was not involved in the study.

“It may be that we do need to change our diets a little bit and eat more of these soy-based diets. The benefits may go beyond cardiac health,” Patel said in a telephone interview.

For the study, Gong Yang and colleagues at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the National Cancer Institute looked at data from a large study of Chinese women called the Shanghai Women’s Health Study. They pulled out the records of 444 of the women, who had lung cancer.

The women had all filled out questionnaires that included details of what they normally ate. They did this twice – when they enrolled in the study, and two years later.

Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. “Initial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factor,” they wrote.

Women who reported eating the least soy were 1.8 times as likely to die, on average. Those who ate the most were about 11 percent less likely to die.

“This finding, along with our previous observation of an approximately 40 percent reduction in risk of incident lung cancer associated with high intake of soy food, provides further support for the role of soy food intake in lung cancer development and prognosis,” the researchers wrote.

Most of the women in the study had never been smokers, and there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that lung cancer is a different disease in smokers versus non-smokers. “In Asian countries, 80 percent of women with lung cancer are never- smokers,” Patel said.

“We don’t know if there is an inherited susceptibility to it,” she added. There might be an infectious disease that causes some cases of lung cancer —like the virus that causes cervical cancer, or the bacteria that causes stomach cancer.

“Although the risks are probably different for American women for developing lung cancer, I do think it is a call to action for more research about how we develop lung cancer,” Patel said. “There are probably 30,000 people in the U.S. who never smoked and who have lung cancer.”

Lung cancer kills 160,000 Americans a year. It’s diagnosed in 110,000 women and 118,000 men a year in the United States alone. It accounts for 27 percent of all cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.

Studies suggest that people who eat the most soy have a lower risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Women may have fewer menopausal symptoms, and perhaps a lower risk of some cancers.

The Food and Drug Administration says soy products may carry a heart-healthy label saying that soy may reduce cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.

It wouldn’t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. “The high soy level patients were eating what the FDA has said is heart-healthy, or 25 grams of soy a day,’ she said.

Studies have shown that supplements containing soy protein don’t have much health benefit. But foods such as soy milk, tofu and edamame do. “We think that consuming food in their whole forms is more important than the supplements,” Patel said.

Some researchers have wondered whether Western people who eat more soy food are benefiting from the soy itself, or because they perhaps use it as a substitute for meat and dairy foods. Patel says this study in China, where soy is a normal part of the diet and where dairy foods are less commonly eaten, suggests it’s the soy itself that adds the benefit.

Soy and many other plant foods contain hormone-like substances called phytoestrogens. These may be affecting a cell compound called estrogen receptor beta, she said. That compound interacts with another one called epidermal growth factor receptor or EGRF, which is known to play a role in many cases on lung cancer.

“Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death. There are many never-smokers with lung cancer,” she said. “People should consider eating a diet that is healthy. By all accounts one that includes soy decreases cardiac risks and could also affect lung cancer,” Patel concluded.

How can people add soy to their diets? A cup of vanilla soymilk poured over cereal provides 6 grams of soy protein, while an eight-ounce glass provides 8 grams. A soy burger delivers 10 grams of soy protein, while 3 ounces of tofu has 8.5 grams.

story_reviews_00746,"You might not want to rush into knee surgery. Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes.

Therapy didn't always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.

""Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,"" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

He was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.

A meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful.

When that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis — or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.

The new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.

After six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.

Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.

""There are patients who would like to get better in a 'fix me' approach"" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women's Hospital.

However, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study's results should change practice. Therapy ""is a reasonable first strategy, with surgery reserved for the minority who don't have improvement,"" Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Melbourne wrote in a commentary in the medical journal.

As it is now, ""millions of people are being exposed to potential risks associated with a treatment that may or may not offer specific benefit, and the costs are substantial,"" she wrote.

Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said.

One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.

""I felt better within two weeks"" on physical therapy, he said. ""My knee is virtually normal today."" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week.

Robert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain.

Then, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. ""I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go 'pop.'"" he recalls. ""I was limping. It was extremely painful.""

An imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm — he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage. He said the sessions weren't that painful and his knee felt better after each one.

""Within a month I was healed,"" Dvorkin said. ""I was completely back to normal.""","Therapy often as good as surgery for knees, study finds",4,Associated Press
story_reviews_00747,"* Deep brain-stimulation device helped stabilise mood

* Half of patients in small trial gained weight

* Anorexia among most common psychiatric disorders in girls

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Scientists have for the first time reported successful use of a brain-stimulating implant to help patients with severe anorexia whose condition had not improved with other treatments.

Doctors implanted a device similar to a pacemaker in the brains of six severe anorexics and found at least half put on weight and showed improvements in mood. Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.

This success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.

Anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.

Treatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.

Commenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.

“The fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,” they said.

“(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.”

DBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.

Implanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.

For their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.

They implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.

The patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.

Initially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.

Three months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

Andres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.

He also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were “especially striking” given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, March 4, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- People suffering from restless legs syndrome may find some relief by taking one of several drugs approved to treat the condition, a new review confirms.

The medications, which include Requip (ropinirole), levodopa, Neurontin (gabapentin) and Lyrica (pregabalin), appear to reduce symptoms of the syndrome in more than 60 percent of patients, researchers report. The first two drugs raise dopamine levels in the body, and the last two drugs reduce the amount of calcium reaching brain cells and trigger the production of other chemicals that help reduce pain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that regulates movement and mood.

""Physicians and patients now have better information on the effectiveness and harms of two types of drug treatments for patients with at least moderately severe restless legs symptoms in which to guide treatment choices,"" said review author Dr. Timothy Wilt, core investigator at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.

Restless legs syndrome causes a person to feel a powerful urge to move his or her legs. The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.

One expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ's Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.

""There is nothing new here at all,"" he said. ""It doesn't add anything to the field.""

This is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.

""These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" he added.

The report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.

For the analysis, Wilt's team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.

In addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson's disease.

Side effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.

There are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.

Neurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.

The most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.

Without insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.

Wilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. ""We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,"" he noted.

""Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,"" he explained.

The harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. ""Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,"" he noted.

Nonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.

Patients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.

""This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is important. Effective treatments for restless legs syndrome are available, and in patients with more severe symptoms may include medications,"" he said.

story_reviews_00749,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Women who took extra folic acid in the weeks before and just after becoming pregnant were less likely to have a child with autism, in a new study from Norway.

Because lack of folic acid has been tied to brain and spinal cord birth defects, groups including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) already call for women who may become pregnant to take daily supplements containing the B vitamin.

The new study “provides an additional reason to take folic acid, in addition to the preventive effect that we already know it has against neural tube defects,” said Dr. Pal Suren from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo, who led the research.

“It underlines the importance of starting early, preferably before the pregnancy,” he told Reuters Health.

One in 88 children in the U.S. has an autism spectrum disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number has risen in recent years, but it’s unclear whether that’s due to more kids with symptoms or doctors who are more likely to recognize and diagnose autism.

The new study, which appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doesn’t prove low folic acid in pregnant women causes their babies to develop autism, or that high doses can prevent it. And Suren and his colleagues didn’t see an effect of folic acid on other autism spectrum disorders, such as Asperger’s.

They followed just over 85,000 women and their children, born between 2002 and 2008.

When women were about halfway through their pregnancies, they reported on any supplements or vitamins they’d taken in the few weeks before becoming pregnant and the two months afterward - the time when folic acid is thought to have the strongest effect on development.

By the time their kids were between three and 10 years old, 270 had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, including 114 with autism itself.

Suren’s team found one in 1,000 babies born to women who reported taking folic acid early in pregnancy had autism, compared to about two in 1,000 of those whose moms didn’t take folic acid. On the other hand, there was no link between fish oil taken during pregnancy and autism risk.

That suggests it’s something about folic acid, in particular, that influences a baby’s autism risk.

“The biggest problem we have is, how do you know it’s folic acid and not just a more health-conscious mother?” said Cathrine Hoyo, who has studied folic acid supplementation at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.

“Doing that (analysis) really added another layer toward convincing us that there is something to it,” Hoyo, who wasn’t involved in the new research, told Reuters Health.

BEFORE PREGNANCY, TOO

Researchers said folic acid’s effects on genes and DNA repair could explain its role in brain development disorders in growing babies, including autism.

The USPSTF recommends all women who are planning to or could become pregnant take between 400 and 800 micrograms of the vitamin daily. The U.S. and Canada have also required flour to be fortified with folic acid since the late 1990s to cut down on birth defect risks.

Still, “The message for folic acid before pregnancy has been a little bit lost,” said Rebecca Schmidt, who has studied prenatal vitamins and autism at the University of California, Davis.

“If you are not even just planning a pregnancy, but able to get pregnant, then you should be taking some sort of folic acid supplement,” she told Reuters Health.

story_reviews_00750,"Mothers who took folic acid supplements around the time they became pregnant were less likely to have children with an autism spectrum disorder, a new study has found.

Researchers in Norway examined health records of more than 85,000 children born there between 1999 and 2009 to see whether they had some kind of autism diagnosis. They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.

Among the 85,176 children in the study, 270 (or 0.32%) received an ASD diagnosis – 114 (0.13%) had autistic disorder, 56 (0.07%) had Asperger syndrome and 100 (0.12%) were diagnosed with “pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,” or PPD-NOS.

These children were more likely to be born to women who did not take folic acid. In the raw analysis, mothers who skipped the supplement were more than 2.1 times more likely to have a child with autistic disorder compared with mothers who took the supplement.

But not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.

The raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.

The results were published in Wednesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.

The study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs.

It’s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.

On the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women’s Health Watch.

The fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy “may be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.” They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.

story_reviews_00751,"Taking folic acid before pregnancy, and through the first several weeks of pregnancy, may help reduce the risk of autism for those children, according to a new study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

Researchers in Norway looked at data from 85,000 pregnancies, and found that women who took the supplement four weeks before pregnancy, and through the eighth week of pregnancy, were 39% less likely to have children with autism.

The Norwegian study is the largest to date on the benefits of folic acid for autism prevention, and marks one of the first tangible things a woman can do to reduce her risk of giving birth to a child with the disorder.

""This is pretty exciting,"" said Alycia Halladay, senior director for environmental and clinical sciences for Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy group. ""It actually supports the idea of actionable things women can do before they become pregnant, and right as conception happens.""

Experts have known for some time that taking folic acid can prevent neural tube birth defects like spina bifida in developing fetuses. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines call for all women of child-bearing age - not just those who plan to get pregnant - to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent birth defects. The same dose appears to provide some benefit in preventing autism, according to the research.

""This is another piece of evidence that supports the beneficial uses of folic acid during pregnancy,"" said Halladay, who was not connected with the study.

The research ""strongly suggests that taking folic acid prior to pregnancy may reduce the risk of autism in children,"" said Dr. Edward R.B. McCabe, medical director for the March of Dimes. The organization also recommends women of child-bearing age take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily before conceiving and 600 to 800 micrograms per day while pregnant.

But some experts aren't quite ready to tout the benefits of folic acid too loudly, particularly for autism prevention.

""It is possible that folic acid ... might provide protection against other neurodevelopmental disorders like autism,"" said Zachary Warren, director of the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Vanderbilt University, who was also not involved in the study. ""While the current study suggests such protection... the data really do not establish anything close to a causal connection.""

FRIDAY, Feb. 8, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- For people with celiac disease, everyday foods such as bread, pizza crust and muffins are potential enemies. But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.

The only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.

The re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

Ideally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.

An enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.

In this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. ""We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,"" Siegel said.

The next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. ""It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,"" Siegel said.

How effective might the enzyme be? ""For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,"" Siegel said. ""For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.""

""For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,"" he added.

The process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. ""We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,"" he said.

Some experts identified limitations to the research.

""This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,"" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. ""Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.""

Murray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. ""It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,"" he said.

But celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. ""People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,"" Murray said.

Three long-awaited studies have shown that mechanically removing a blood clot from a stroke patient’s brain is no more useful than the older treatment of giving an IV dose of a clot-dissolving drug to the whole body.

The results of the clinical trials, presented this week at a meeting in Hawaii, shocked and surprised stroke physicians. Many had already adopted the more aggressive strategy over the past decade.

“For the stroke field, this is a really big deal,” Walter Koroshetz, deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said of the findings, which were presented over three days at the International Stroke Conference in Hono­lulu.

NINDS paid for two of the trials, one of which cost $27 million. One study took eight years to complete because it was so difficult to enroll patients willing to take the chance that they would be randomly assigned to get the older treatment.

Practitioners hoped that “endovascular treatment,” in which a catheter is threaded into a blocked artery and the clot pulled out, would do for stroke patients what it has done for heart attack patients. In them, going after clots with angioplasty balloons and stents is clearly more effective than giving clot-dissolving drugs through a vein in the arm.

“We did this study with the strong expectation that we would find a positive benefit. We were surprised,” said Joseph P. Broderick of the University of Cincinnati Neuroscience Institute, who headed one of the studies.

His view was echoed by Alfonso Ciccone, a neurologist from Milan who led a clinical trial in Italy: “We were surprised. We wanted the superiority of endovascular treatment.”

Whether the findings will cause physicians to abandon the practice is uncertain.

Insurance companies and Medicare, the health insurer for the elderly, already cover the endovascular procedure. It costs about $23,000 compared with $11,000 for acute stroke treatment using intravenous clot-dissolving drugs, known as thrombolytics.

Further, many practitioners think that newer clot-retrieving devices work better than the ones used in the three trials. Because endovascular procedures were shown to be no more dangerous than IV thrombolytics, physicians may continue to perform them and assume the outcomes can only get better.

“Will it change practice? That’s a good question,” said Koroshetz. “The payers may look at this and wonder if they should continue paying for these procedures. If it gets to that point, then clearly things will change.”

Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. About 800,000 people suffer a stroke each year, and about 130,000 die.

Nearly 90 percent of strokes occur when a clot blocks an artery in the brain, starving the region downstream of blood and oxygen. If flow isn’t restored quickly, brain tissue and the functions it controls — movement, speech, cognition — are damaged or can die.

Over the past 20 years, studies showed that if a person having a stroke gets a thrombolytic drug within three hours of when the symptoms start (4½ hours for certain patients), the process can be reversed and a lifetime of disability avoided. Later than that, little is gained; the brain cells are too damaged to survive. In fact, giving the drugs too late can make matters worse. Uncontrolled bleeding can occur as the dying tissue breaks down.

Early observations suggested that approaching the clot with a catheter and either injecting clot-dissolving drugs into it or snagging it and pulling it out produced better results. In 2004, the FDA began approving use of the catheters in the brain because they had been proved useful elsewhere in the body. The three studies reported this week (which will eventually be published in the New England Journal of Medicine) tested the hypothesis in a rigorous way.

In the largest trial, called IMS III, all patients got the IV clot-dissolving drug tPA within three hours of the start of stroke symptoms. Half were then assigned to get an imaging study that looked at the arteries of the brain to see whether a blockage remained. If it did, the doctors went after it with an endovascular procedure. The other half of the patients got standard treatment, which didn’t include the procedure. Forty-one percent of patients recovered completely in the endovascular group and 39 percent recovered completely in the control group, outcomes that were no different statistically. Death within three months was essentially the same too: 19 percent vs. 22 percent.

In the Italian study, called SYNTHESIS Expansion, 362 stroke patients were randomly assigned to get either IV tPA or endovascular treatment. At three months, 35 percent of the patients in the tPA group were alive without any disabilities, compared with 30 percent of the endovascular group. That also was not significantly different.

The third study, called MR RESCUE, run out of Georgetown University, was more complicated.

It randomly assigned 118 patients less than eight hours out from the start of their strokes to receive standard care or have the clot removed with a catheter device. They also got CAT or MRI scans to see whether they had a large or small amount of brain tissue still alive and salvageable. Removing the clot wasn’t better than standard care in either group — those with a lot or a little brain tissue to lose.

“I think everybody was a little surprised. But mainly disappointed,” said Chelsea S. Kidwell, the Georgetown neurologist who headed the study.

Why endovascular treatment wasn’t better is a mystery that the researchers are struggling to explain. The answer could be in the patients, the device or the timing of the procedure.

In IMS III, patients with large strokes benefited from clot removal more than those with small ones, but there weren’t enough patients in the study to make such a fine distinction with certainty.

“It’s a hint. But it’s not proof,” Broderick said.

In MR RESCUE, only 67 percent of arteries opened up completely after the clot was grabbed. Current devices, which use a mesh stent to hold the clot more firmly, are successful more than 80 percent of the time.

“The stroke community is hopeful that with the new generation devices we will show better outcomes,” Kidwell said.

In the Italian study, patients getting endovascular treatment were 3.75 hours into their stroke — an hour longer than those getting IV treatment, because of the logistics of assembling the procedure team. “That hour could have made a difference. We know that ‘time is brain,’ ” Ciccone said.

The three trials demonstrated how hard it is to test things once they’re in widespread use. History is replete with treatments (such as supplemental oxygen for premature infants) and devices (such as pulmonary artery catheters) used routinely before being shown to be harmful or of little value.

It took from 2004 to 2011 for the MR RESCUE team to recruit the 118 patients in the trial. It had permission to run the study in 30 hospitals but found only 22 that were willing to participate. More than 10 other hospitals were invited to join but declined because their neurologists were already convinced the catheter treatment was better — a view that turns out not to be true.",Long-awaited stroke studies show hopeful new treatment no better than older one,5,Stroke

A study shows that not all good fats are the same when it comes to protecting your health.

For decades, the message about fats has been relatively simple — reduce the amount of oils and fats you eat from animal and dairy products (less red meat and cheese) and substitute them with healthier fats from plants or fish (olive oil, omega-3 fatty acids). The difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods — animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated, which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms, while plant fats are unsaturated, meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other. Saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks.

But in the latest study on fats published in the BMJ, researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause, as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart-related conditions.

The study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. For more than three years, researchers at the time followed 458 men aged 30 to 59 years old who had a history of heart disease; about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega-6 linoleic acid, which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it. The other half were not told to change their diet in any way. When that study was published in 1978, researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega-6 group, but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths.

(MORE: Study: ‘Good’ Fats Even Better for the Heart Than We Thought)

So Dr. Christopher Ramsden, a clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health, contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study. This information involved deaths from heart-related causes, and the new analysis showed that the omega-6 group had a 17% higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease, compared with 11% among the control group.

The American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that people replace 25% to 35% of their daily saturated-fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The recommendation is based on a review of the available data.

(MORE: Study: Eating Omega-3s May Help Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk)

The latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. “I wouldn’t necessarily say that the [current advice] is necessarily completely wrong,” he says. “What happened is that in the 1960s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same. They were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood-cholesterol levels. Then, over the ensuing decades, it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats, and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects.”

There has been some evidence to suggest that omega-6 fatty acids, for example, may trigger inflammation, a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in deepwater fish like salmon, tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions. Ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail, rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body.

(MORE: Can Olive Oil Help Prevent Stroke?)

Recognizing that need, the AHA says it is considering re-evaluating all its dietary recommendations, and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits. When health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats, for example, many replaced the fats with carbohydrates, which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood, triglycerides. “One of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture,” says Lichtenstein. “Just looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component, and may lead to unanticipated consequences. We need to look at dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients or individual food components.”

Whether the association will change its advice about consuming linoleic acid isn’t clear yet, but Ramsden says the results of the latest study “could have important implications” for the way people eat if they want to stay heart-healthy.",Omega-6 Fats Linked to Increased Risk of Heart Disease,3,Diet studies

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 6, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Enduring dietary wisdom -- that polyunsaturated vegetable fats are better for your heart than saturated animal fats -- may be turned on its head by a fresh analysis of a nearly 50-year-old study.

The reasoning has been that a diet rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats lowers cholesterol, and is therefore good for heart health. But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.

The original ""Sydney Diet Heart Study,"" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.

But in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.

""There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,"" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

""And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,"" Ramsden explained.

The findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.

The 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.

The men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.

While omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.

The second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.

By newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.

In turn, Ramsden's investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.

Despite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.

Ramsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.

""So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,"" he cautioned.

But he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.

""What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,"" he said. ""Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it's a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.""

On that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.

""But I don't think this is going to change AHA recommendations,"" she said. ""Because there's very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.""

""So, I don't think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,"" Kris-Etherton said. ""Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.""

Yoga does the body good, and according to a new study, it may ease the mind as well.

“Yoga has also become such a cultural phenomenon that it has become difficult for physicians and consumers to differentiate legitimate claims from hype,” researchers from Duke University Medical Center write in their study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry. In order to explore the widely held belief that practicing yoga can relieve mental stress, the team reviewed more than 100 studies on the effect of yoga and mental health.

“Most individuals already know that yoga produces some kind of a calming effect. Individually, people feel better after doing the physical exercise,” says lead study author Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center. “Mentally, people feel calmer, sharper, maybe more content. We thought it’s time to see if we could pull all [the literature] together … to see if there’s enough evidence that the benefits individual people notice can be used to help people with mental illness.”

(MORE: Yoga Can Help Stroke Survivors Regain Their Balance)

Their findings suggest that yoga does in fact have positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.

The researchers focused on 16 studies that recorded the effects of practicing yoga on mental-health issues ranging from depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, sleep complaints and eating disorders to cognitive problems. They found positive effects of the mind-and-body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition. Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Some of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors — just as other forms of exercise do.

(MORE: We Tried This: Aerial Vinyasa (or Upside-Down) Yoga)

Embracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans’ centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military. A study published earlier this month of 70 active-duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep.

The researchers say there’s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health, and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders. “Many millions of Americans are doing yoga and many millions of Americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily. Despite all of this, the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies. We did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study,” says Doraiswamy.

(MORE: Does Yoga Really Drive People Wild with Desire?)

But while the research is promising, yoga likely won’t be a panacea for mental illness. Nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice. “What we are saying is that we still need to do further, large-scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first-line treatment,” says Doraiswamy. “We are not saying throw away your Prozac and turn to yoga. We’re saying it has the promise and potential. If a large national study were done, it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs.” In the meantime, he says it doesn’t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits.",Can Yoga Reduce Symptoms of Major Psychiatric Disorders?,2,mental health

MONDAY, Jan. 28, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-conserving surgery for early stage breast cancers may result in better survival than mastectomy, according to a new study.

For those with early stage breast cancer, ""lumpectomy is just as effective if not more effective than mastectomy,"" said researcher Dr. Shelley Hwang, chief of breast surgery at Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C.

""There are lots of women who think the more [treatment] they do, the better they will do,"" she said. ""This refutes that.""

The findings, published online Jan. 28 in the journal Cancer, are especially strong for women over 50 with hormone-sensitive cancers, the researchers found.

Earlier research had also concluded that the two procedures are similarly effective, but Hwang's is a more ""real-world"" study.

Hwang's team looked at 14 years of data from the California Cancer Registry, following more than 112,000 women with early stage breast cancer (stages 1 or 2) between 1990 and 2004. Ages ranged from 39 to 80.

More than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone.

Hwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. ""We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don't get radiation after mastectomy,"" she said.

The researchers tracked the women's progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes.

For the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said.

Over the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer.

""The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,"" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow.

Among those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy.

Not all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast.

The percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it.

The new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said.

The findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study.

The study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. ""They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,"" she said. ""They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage.""

Dr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study ""clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates.""

But, Woodward added, ""I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.""

The study was observational, Hwang stressed. It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer.

Hwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information. However, ""I don't want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing,"" Hwang said. ""At the end of the day, personal preference trumps everything else. I fully support the patient's options to choose the best treatment for themselves.""

story_reviews_00758,"(Reuters) - Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc said its experimental drug for a rare sleep disorder proved effective in a second late-stage trial, and the company now plans to apply for a U.S. approval for the drug in mid-2013.

The study, named Reset, was a 20-patient trial designed to test the maintenance effect of a 20 mg dose of the drug, tasimelteon.

Vanda on December 18 said the drug performed better than a placebo in the first of the four planned late-stage trials on the drug. The company’s shares rose as much as 37 percent on that day.

While the first two are efficacy studies, the remaining two are intended to establish the safety profile of the drug.

The second trial showed that patients treated by the drug maintained their clinical benefits while placebo-treated patients showed significant deterioration in measures of night-time sleep, daytime naps and timing of sleep.

The drug is being tested for ‘non-24-hour disorder’ that has no approved treatment. The condition, in which a person’s body clock does not automatically set to the 24-hour day, affects a majority of blind people.

“These results also highlight the importance of chronic therapy in treating Non-24,” CEO Mihael Polymeropoulos said in a statement on Wednesday.

Tasimelteon received orphan drug status — which offers several years of marketing exclusivity for drugs developed for rare conditions — from the FDA in 2010 and from the European Commission in 2011.

An orphan drug, if approved, can usually fetch a premium pricing in the market.

MONDAY, Jan. 21 (HealthDay News) -- A skin patch for the treatment of migraines, and the intense waves of nausea that often accompany these debilitating headaches, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Called Zecuity, the patch contains sumatriptan, one of the most widely prescribed medications for migraines.

According to Dr. Fawad Khan, a neurologist with Ochsner Neuroscience Institute in New Orleans, few drugs are approved for the treatment of acute, symptomatic migraine. To complicate matters, many migraine sufferers can also experience severe bouts of nausea and vomiting.

Another expert described the problem this way.

""I've had some patients where the nausea and vomiting was so bad they couldn't even swallow a pill,"" said Nancy Waltman, a nurse practitioner with the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Nursing, Lincoln Division.

A nasal spray is available, as is an injection, but many patients aren't comfortable with these options, Khan and Waltman noted.

Khan said the Zecuity patch is ""simple, efficient and can deliver the exact amount of dosage with minimal variability.""

The patch is attached to the upper arm or thigh, and when the patient pushes a button the drug is delivered through the skin. Zecuity, which is battery-operated, delivers 6.5 milligrams of sumatriptan over the course of about five hours and can relieve nausea, as well as reduce sensitivity to light and sound.

NuPathe Inc., which makes Zecuity, hopes to have the patch on the market later this year.

Research involving 800 patients ultimately led to the approval of Zecuity. One study found that 18 percent of patients using the patch were headache-free after two hours, compared with 9 percent of those using an inactive placebo. About half achieved a reduction in their headache after two hours, compared with 29 percent of those using the placebo.

And 84 percent of patients using the patch were relieved of their nausea, compared with 63 percent of those in the placebo group, according to a company news release.

The most frequent side effects were pain at the site of application along with tingling, itching, warmth and discomfort.

Patients with heart disease or who are using antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should also be careful when taking sumatriptans, said Waltman, who added that she thought the patches ""are wonderful.""

One concern, though, is cost, Waltman cautioned.

It's not clear how much the patches will cost, but the class of medications known as triptans can be expensive, as much as $300 a month (although sumatriptan now has a generic version), Waltman said.

In general, though, ""the more options that are available to migraine headache patients, the better,"" Waltman said. ""Migraine patients tend to be underdiagnosed and undertreated and inappropriately treated.""

NuPathe CEO Armando Anido told Bloomberg News, ""We anticipate the product will be available for sale in the fourth quarter of this year.""

When it comes to supernutritious foods, the blueberry has long had a health halo floating over it.

Going back to Colonial times when Native Americans and English settlers ground up blueberries and added them to porridge, in both dried and fresh forms, there have been hints of health-promoting effects.

In recent years, regular consumption of berries has been linked to better brain health and a decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Now, a new study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation suggests eating three servings per week of blueberries and strawberries helps cut the risk of heart attacks among some women.

""We showed for the first time that a regular intake of substances that are naturally present in red-, blue-colored fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of a heart attack by about 32 percent in young and middle-aged women [ages mid-40s to 60],"" compared with women who ate berries once a month or less, says study author Aedin Cassidy of the University of East Anglia. The researchers found other fruits such as apples and pears were not associated with a decreased risk.

To study the relationship between berry consumption and heart disease, Cassidy and her collaborators at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed findings from the Nurses Health Study 2 which includes more than 90,000 nurses in the U.S. Periodically over the past 18 years the nurses have reported details about their diets and lifestyles to researchers. At the same time, researchers have monitored the nurses' health to see which diseases they go on to develop, or not.

It's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. Cassidy says the association between berry consumption and heart disease was strengthened when she and her collaborators controlled for other reasons that could have explained the finding.

""Even when we adjusted for things like fat intake, fiber intake, medication use, or body size, and for example, exercise, we still got these strong reductions in risk,"" Cassidy says.

So what's in blueberries that makes them so good for us? Researchers have pinpointed a class of plant compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds give the red and blue color to everything from berries to eggplants to cherries. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects.

""They have effects on blood pressure in animal models,"" says Cassidy. And in lab experiments they're shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, as well as help modulate nitric oxide in the body, which could help arteries stay more elastic and flexible.

All of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. But he says it's important to point out that the women in this study weren't prime candidates for heart attacks anyway.

""Having a heart attack when you're a woman between ages of 45 and 60 is distinctly unusual,"" says Eckel.

Would the protective effect hold up for older women? Eckel says it's not clear.

""But nonetheless, for the first time I think we have some evidence that the intake of theses anthocyanins may have a protective effect.""

So, go ahead. Load up on berries. And if they're out of season, like now, studies show frozen berries have similar levels of beneficial compounds.",Women With A Berry-Snacking Habit May Have Healthier Hearts,4,Diet studies

The benefits for the heart of eating strawberries and blueberries can build up over a lifetime, according to the latest research.

Bright-colored berries have long been a part of any healthy diet, owing mainly to the anthocyanins that give them their vibrant color and act as antioxidants to fight off damage to cells. Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.

In the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.

During the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn’t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women’s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.

“These foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,” says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. “This supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.”

So what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.

(MORE: Can Eating Fruits and Veggies Outwit Bad Heart Genes?)

The results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman’s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. “Although we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,” says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. “The take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you’re getting benefits that last for life. When we’re making choices in our 20s, we may think that a burger and fries is great, but the message is that there are alternatives that make a difference for the rest of your life. It is a powerful message that we can prevent cardiovascular disease by what we eat.” Something worth remembering the next time you’re in the produce aisle.",Eating Berries Linked to Lower Heart-Disease Risk Among Women,3,Diet studies

MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Eating three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries each week may help reduce a woman's risk of heart attack, a large new study suggests.

The study included nearly 94,000 young and middle-aged women who took part in the Nurses' Health Study II. The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.

During the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.

This benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.

The study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.

""Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,"" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. ""These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.""

Men are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.

Although more research is needed to confirm these benefits, ""these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,"" the study concluded.

Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a ""huge study that followed women for a long period of time. Women who ate three or more servings of strawberries and blueberries per week decreased their heart attack risk by one-third. This is pretty compelling.""

Steinbaum's advice to both women and men is to include berries in their diet, and make them part of their daily fruit and vegetable fill.

One serving of blueberries or strawberries equals about one cup.

Dana Greene, a nutritionist in Boston, regularly tells her patients to consume more fruits and vegetables, including berries.

""They are so good for you,"" Greene said. Besides flavonoids, berries also are loaded with other nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium and folate.

""I tell all patients to make sure that half of their plate is filled with fruits and vegetables, especially richly colored ones like blueberries and strawberries,"" Greene said. ""Berries can also help people lose weight and maintain that loss because they feel fuller faster. There is no downside.""

The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 9, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Women with heavy menstrual bleeding may find some relief using an intrauterine device, or IUD, containing the hormone levonorgestrel, according to new research.

British researchers found that the treated IUD was more effective at reducing the effects of heavy menstrual bleeding (also called menorrhagia) on quality of life compared to other treatments. Normally used for contraception, the intrauterine system is sold under the brand name Mirena.

""If women suffer with heavy periods and do not want to get pregnant -- as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a contraceptive -- then having the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a very good first-line treatment option that does not require taking regular, daily oral medications,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Janesh Gupta, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women's Hospital in England.

For women who do want to get pregnant, Gupta said, taking the blood-clotting drug tranexamic acid during periods is an alternate method of treating heavy periods.

Results of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Heavy menstrual bleeding is a significant problem for many women. About 20 percent of gynecologist office visits in the United States and the United Kingdom are because of heavy bleeding. There are several nonhormonal and hormonal treatment options available to reduce blood loss.

The current study compared the use of traditional medical options -- tranexamic acid pills, mefenamic acid (Ponstel), combined estrogen-progestogen and progesterone alone -- to the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system.

The researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. The researchers also asked about quality of life and sexual activity, and noted whether a woman needed surgery for heavy periods.

Women in the IUD group reported much greater improvement -- 32.7 points on the symptom scale versus 21.4 points in the standard treatment group. They also reported greater improvements in quality of life.

There was no difference in the rates of surgery or sexual activity between the two groups.

More women were still using the intrauterine system after two years than were still taking standard medical treatments -- 64 percent compared to 38 percent.

Gupta said the main reason she believes the IUD group was more successful at reducing symptoms is that there is ""100 percent compliance with treatment as there is a continuous drug treatment effect."" Women taking medications may forget to take them sometimes.

Serious side effects were similar between the groups. Gupta said the main side effect from the intrauterine system is irregular periods for up to six months.

Another expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.

""This study really adds to the evidence that shows how useful this intrauterine system is for heavy menstrual bleeding,"" said Dr. Eve Espey, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque.

Getting an intrauterine system generally just requires one office visit, Espey said. Insertion of the device may be mildly uncomfortable for some women, she said.

For women who may be hesitant to use an IUD because of pelvic infections linked to an early version called the Dalkon Shield, Gupta said that as long as women are screened for sexually transmitted diseases before getting an intrauterine system, the risk of infection is low.

Espey agreed. ""Today's intrauterine systems have a great side-effect profile,"" she said. ""They also have a high continuation and a high satisfaction rate.""

* Standard treatment lithium discovered 60 years ago

* Scientists say new drug could have fewer side effects

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A drug for bipolar disorder that works like lithium - the most common and effective treatment - but without lithium’s side-effects has been identified by British researchers in tests on mice.

Scientists say the drug, ebselen, may be a swift answer to long-sought after better medications for patients with the manic depressive disorder, since it is already known to be safe.

If the drug could be “repurposed” and licensed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, it could reduce the unpleasant side effects of weight gain, thirst and potential kidney damage that patients risk when taking lithium.

“Ebselen is an experimental drug that has been tested in people for other conditions, and does not have problematic side effects like lithium does,” said Grant Churchill of the department of pharmacology at Britain’s Oxford University.

Bipolar disorder effects around 1 percent of the population worldwide and sufferers can experience moods that swing from one extreme to another, and have periods of depression and mania lasting several weeks or longer. These high and low phases are often so extreme they interfere with everyday life and work.

In a telephone interview Churchill said that in tests, his team found that mice who were made manic with small doses of amphetamines were able to be calmed again with ebselen.

“In mice, ebselen works like lithium,” Churchill said. “Now we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.”

Some 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment.

But it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression.

Churchill worked with Sridhar Vasudevan to filter through a library of existing drugs - the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection - that are considered safe but do not currently have a proven use.

They screened the library for any drugs that blocked an enzyme that is key to lithium’s success and found ebselen was a possible lithium mimic.

“This is one of the first handful of examples of drug repurposing, where a new use has been found for an existing drug,” Vasudevan said.

Ebselen is an antioxidant originally developed up to late stage, or phase III, clinical trials by the Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of stroke, but which never reached market and is now out of patent.

Vasudevan said his study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, showed ebselen had the same or similar action as lithium in the brains of mice, blocking the same enzyme.

The researchers are a now starting a small study in healthy human volunteers to look for effects on brain function. If that shows ebselen has similar effects to lithium, they plan to move to second stage trial in bipolar patients.

story_reviews_00767,"Jan. 4, 2013 -- A new study from Australia may offer a new way of identifying people at risk of glaucoma years before vision loss happens. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.

Glaucoma a ‘Vision Thief’ About 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don’t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. “We call this disease a ‘thief of vision’ because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,” Iwach says.",New Eye Test May Help Predict Risk of Glaucoma,3,WebMD

The promise of genetic medicine is beginning to be fulfilled, but it's been a long, hard slog.

Take the story of Kalydeco. It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.

But the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.

A good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.

CF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.

The announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.

At the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.

The first prediction turned out to be right. ""But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,"" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. ""So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.""

toggle caption Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

It took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. ""We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,"" says Van Goor.

One of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.

From the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.

But for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.

Emily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.

""I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,"" says Schaller. ""But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.""

Schaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.

Schaller isn't particularly bothered by that. ""Everyone talks about curing a disease — cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.""

The time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.

They're also likely to be expensive. Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year.",Drug Fulfills Promise Of Research Into Cystic Fibrosis Gene,3,NPR

MONDAY, Dec. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled despite taking several medications, a short burst of radio waves at the nerves around the kidneys may do the trick, a small new study says.

The treatment was effective for at least six months. The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.

The technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.

The procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.

The study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.

""This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,"" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. ""Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.""

For the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.

All the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.

Esler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.

The 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.

Fonarow noted: ""In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.""

The procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.

""Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,"" Esler said in a journal news release. ""We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.""

Whether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.

Another expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.

""Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,"" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.""

Even with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. ""You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,"" he said.

Singh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.

Fonarow added: ""While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.""

According to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.

Among these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.

Researchers say that drop may seem small, but on a public health level a reduction like that would equate to a 10% reduction in deaths due to heart disease .

The study shows that within hours of drinking it, beet juice lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by an average of 4-5 points among a small group of healthy men .

Dec. 14, 2012 -- Drinking a glass of beet juice may have an immediate impact on lowering blood pressure , according to a new study.

Beetroot Benefits

Previous studies have shown that beet juice, also known as beetroot juice, can lower blood pressure in a laboratory setting. But researchers say this is the first study to look at the effects of adding beet juice to a heathy person’s diet without making any other diet or lifestyle changes.

The results appear in Nutrition Journal.

In the study, 15 men and 15 women drank either 17.6 ounces of a beet juice beverage consisting of about three-fourths beet juice and one-fourth apple juice, or a placebo juice. They were then monitored for 24 hours. The same procedure was repeated two weeks later, with those who drank the placebo on the first round receiving beetroot juice on the second.

Among both men and women, the results showed a trend to lower systolic blood pressure six hours after drinking the beet juice.

But when researchers limited their analysis to men only, they found a significant reduction of about 4.7 points among those who drank the beetroot juice.

Previous studies have also suggested that beetroot’s blood-pressure-lowering effects may not be as strong in women.

In this case, Coles says it may be partially explained by the fact that the women in the study tended to be older, and many were on prescription medications, such as oral contraceptives.",Beet Juice Lowers Blood Pressure,3,Diet studies

“Our goal is to have a cure, but we can’t say that word,” said Dr. Carl June, who leads the research team at the University of Pennsylvania. He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases.

Three adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The Pennsylvania researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in Atlanta at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology.

Despite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. “I think this is a major breakthrough,” said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Dr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the University of Minnesota , called the Pennsylvania results “phenomenal” and said they were “what we’ve all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent.”

A major drug company, Novartis , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university’s campus to bring the treatment to market.

Hervé Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research “fantastic” and said it had the potential — if the early results held up — to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient’s immune system, may also eventually be used against tumors like breast and prostate cancer .

To perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient’s T-cells — a type of white blood cell — and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia.

The altered T-cells — called chimeric antigen receptor cells — are then dripped back into the patient’s veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer.

The T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant.

A sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills — a reaction that oncologists call “shake and bake,” Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in blood pressure — effects that nearly killed Emma.

Steroids sometimes ease the reaction, but they did not help Emma. Her temperature hit 105. She wound up on a ventilator, unconscious and swollen almost beyond recognition, surrounded by friends and family who had come to say goodbye.

But at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick.

Dr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 — his daughter takes it for rheumatoid arthritis . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma’s, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was “amazing.”

Within hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang “Happy Birthday.”

Since then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients.

In patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years.

Dr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: “These T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it’s eliminated from your body and you have to take it again.” But T-cells, he said, “could potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times.”

The Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient — a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like Viagra or cholesterol medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug.

But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits.

“The economic model is totally acceptable,” Mr. Hoppenot said.

But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage.

Dr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient — far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, “Our costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs.”

The research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells.

It is not clear whether a patient’s body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness.

So far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess.

Drug Shows Promise for Lupus Skin Conditions



WebMD Health News By Salynn Boyles WebMD Health News

Dec. 7, 2012 -- A drug related to thalidomide may be more potent and less toxic than thalidomide, which is often used to treat lupus skin conditions.

In a small study from Spain, lupus patients showed dramatic improvements in skin lesions while taking the drug, lenalidomide (Revlimid), and most relapsed soon after they stopped taking it.

Thalidomide’s Infamous Past

Thalidomide is best known as the drug that caused thousands of children to be born with missing limbs and other birth defects in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

In more recent years it has been brought back to the market to treat a number of serious conditions, but its use is monitored closely to ensure that it is not taken by women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant.

Dermatology professor Andrew G. Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs.

He says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments.

“The question has been, ‘What do you do with the rest?’” he says.

Franks says thalidomide can help an additional 75% of patients achieve remission. But side effects are common and some, including nerve damage in the hands and feet, can be permanent.

Lenalidomide Highly Effective in Small Study

The lenalidomide study included 15 women with lupus skin conditions; six had lupus in other areas of the body, too. They all were followed for seven to 30 months.

All had received standard treatments, and 14 had been treated with thalidomide previously.

The majority of the patients (60%) had the most common subtype of lupus-related skin disease, known as discoid lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by red, scaly patches that can scar.

One patient withdrew from the study after one week due to digestive system side effects. All the other patients showed improvement, and the rash cleared up in 86%.

The researchers note that the study dose was “generally well-tolerated.” No new nerve symptoms were reported.

Similar to treatment with thalidomide, most of the patients had a relapse of their skin problems within weeks of stopping the drug.

No Progression to Full Disease

Several earlier small studies raised concerns that treatment with lenalidomide may be linked to an increased risk of progression to full-blown lupus, not just lupus limited to the skin.

Josep Ordi-Ros, who led the Spanish study, says this was not seen in the latest study, which was published Dec. 6 in the journal Arthritis Research & Therapy.

But Cynthia Aranow, MD, of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y., says larger studies will be needed to determine if the drug is truly safe and effective for patients who do not respond to other treatments.

She adds that the drug appears to have a similar risk for birth defects as thalidomide, so it will need to be monitored just as carefully.

“There are many questions that remain,” she says.

Lenalidomide is available as Revlimid to treat people with multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. According to the manufacturer’s site, the cost of Revlimid at the doses used in this study would be about $440 a pill.",Drug Shows Promise for Lupus Skin Conditions,3,

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental antidepressant that targets the brain in a different way appears to both act fast and last long, researchers say.

The new drug -- called GLYX-13 -- is so far given in an intravenous form and was recently tested in patients who had not responded to other antidepressants. It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.

""We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,"" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. ""In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.""

One expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.

""It sounds like an exciting development,"" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. ""Because it's so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,"" Bruno said.

Currently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.

Although SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.

GLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won't respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.

Moskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.

The GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.

The results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla. Findings from the team's animal research that led to the new method appeared online Dec. 3 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.

Moskal is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which conducted the study. Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.

The study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.

GLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.

Moskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.

Antidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.

A new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.

Because the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.

For his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.

Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00778,"Dr. Eric P. Winer, chief of women’s cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said that even women who completed their five years of tamoxifen months or years ago might consider starting on the drug again.

Tamoxifen blocks the effect of the hormone estrogen, which fuels tumor growth in estrogen receptor-positive cancers that account for about 65 percent of cases in premenopausal women. Some small studies in the 1990s suggested that there was no benefit to using tamoxifen longer than five years, so that has been the standard.

About 227,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, and an estimated 30,000 of them are in premenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive cancer and prime candidates for tamoxifen. But postmenopausal women also take tamoxifen if they cannot tolerate the alternative drugs, known as aromatase inhibitors.

The new study, known as Atlas, included nearly 7,000 women with ER-positive disease who had completed five years of tamoxifen. They came from about three dozen countries. Half were chosen at random to take the drug another five years, while the others were told to stop.

In the group assigned to take tamoxifen for 10 years, 21.4 percent had a recurrence of breast cancer in the ensuing 10 years, meaning the period 5 to 14 years after their diagnoses. The recurrence rate for those who took only five years of tamoxifen was 25.1 percent.

About 12.2 percent of those in the 10-year treatment group died from breast cancer, compared with 15 percent for those in the control group.

There was virtually no difference in death and recurrence between the two groups during the five years of extra tamoxifen. The difference came in later years, suggesting that tamoxifen has a carry-over effect that lasts long after women stop taking it.

Whether these differences are big enough to cause women to take the drug for twice as long remains to be seen.

“The treatment effect is real, but it’s modest,” said Dr. Paul E. Goss, director of breast cancer research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Tamoxifen has side effects, including endometrial cancer, blood clots and hot flashes, which cause many women to stop taking the drug. In the Atlas trial, it appears that roughly 40 percent of the patients assigned to take tamoxifen for the additional five years stopped prematurely.

Some 3.1 percent of those taking the extra five years of tamoxifen got endometrial cancer versus 1.6 percent in the control group. However, only 0.6 percent of those in the longer treatment group died from endometrial cancer or pulmonary blood clots, compared with 0.4 percent in the control group.

“Over all, the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,” Trevor J. Powles of the Cancer Center London, said in a commentary published by The Lancet.

Dr. Judy E. Garber, director of the Center for Cancer Genetics and Prevention at Dana-Farber, said many women have a love-hate relationship with hormone therapies.

“They don’t feel well on them, but it’s their safety net,” said Dr. Garber, who added that the news would be welcomed by many patients who would like to stay on the drug. “I have patients who agonize about this, people who are coming to the end of their tamoxifen.”

Emily Behrend, who is a few months from finishing her five years on tamoxifen, said she would definitely consider another five years. “If it can keep the cancer away, I’m all for it,” said Ms. Behrend, 39, a single mother in Tomball, Tex. She is taking the antidepressant Effexor to help control the night sweats and hot flashes caused by tamoxifen.

Cost is not considered a huge barrier to taking tamoxifen longer because the drug can be obtained for less than $200 a year.

The results, while answering one question, raise many new ones, including whether even more than 10 years of treatment would be better still.

Perhaps the most important question is what the results mean for postmenopausal women. Even many women who are premenopausal at the time of diagnosis will pass through menopause by the time they finish their first five years of tamoxifen, or will have been pushed into menopause by chemotherapy.

Postmenopausal patients tend to take aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole or letrozole, which are more effective than tamoxifen at preventing breast cancer recurrence, though they do not work for premenopausal women.

Mr. Peto said he thought the results of the Atlas study would “apply to endocrine therapy in general,” meaning that 10 years of an aromatase inhibitor would be better than five years. Other doctors were not so sure.

The Atlas study was paid for by various organizations including the United States Army, the British government and AstraZeneca, which makes the brand-name version of tamoxifen.",Extended Use of Breast Cancer Drug Suggested,5,
story_reviews_00779,"Breast cancer patients taking the drug tamoxifen can cut their chances of having the disease come back or kill them if they stay on the pills for 10 years instead of five years as doctors recommend now, a major study finds.

The results could change treatment, especially for younger women. The findings are a surprise because earlier research suggested that taking the hormone-blocking drug for longer than five years didn't help and might even be harmful.

In the new study, researchers found that women who took tamoxifen for 10 years lowered their risk of a recurrence by 25 percent and of dying of breast cancer by 29 percent compared to those who took the pills for just five years.

In absolute terms, continuing on tamoxifen kept three additional women out of every 100 from dying of breast cancer within five to 14 years from when their disease was diagnosed. When added to the benefit from the first five years of use, a decade of tamoxifen can cut breast cancer mortality in half during the second decade after diagnosis, researchers estimate.

Some women balk at taking a preventive drug for so long, but for those at high risk of a recurrence, ""this will be a convincer that they should continue,"" said Dr. Peter Ravdin, director of the breast cancer program at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio.

He reviewed results of the study, which was being presented Wednesday at a breast cancer conference in San Antonio and published by the British medical journal Lancet.

""The result of this trial will have a major, immediate impact on premenopausal women,"" Ravdin said.

About 50,000 of the roughly 230,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States each year occur in women before menopause. Most breast cancers are fueled by estrogen, and hormone blockers are known to cut the risk of recurrence in such cases.

Tamoxifen long was the top choice, but newer drugs called aromatase inhibitors—sold as Arimidex, Femara, Aromasin and in generic form—do the job with less risk of causing uterine cancer and other problems.

But the newer drugs don't work well before menopause. Even some women past menopause choose tamoxifen over the newer drugs, which cost more and have different side effects such as joint pain, bone loss and sexual problems.

The new study aimed to see whether over a very long time, longer treatment with tamoxifen could help.

Dr. Christina Davies of the University of Oxford in England and other researchers assigned 6,846 women who already had taken tamoxifen for five years to either stay on it or take dummy pills for another five years.

Researchers saw little difference in the groups five to nine years after diagnosis. But beyond that time, 15 percent of women who had stopped taking tamoxifen after five years had died of breast cancer versus 12 percent of those who took it for 10 years. Cancer had returned in 25 percent of women on the shorter treatment versus 21 percent of those treated longer.

Tamoxifen had some troubling side effects: Longer use nearly doubled the risk of endometrial cancer. But it rarely proved fatal, and there was no increased risk among premenopausal women in the study—the very group tamoxifen helps most.

""Overall the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,"" Dr. Trevor Powles of the Cancer Centre London wrote in an editorial published with the study.

The study was sponsored by cancer research organizations in Britain and Europe, the United States Army, and AstraZeneca PLC, which makes Nolvadex, a brand of tamoxifen, which also is sold as a generic for 10 to 50 cents a day. Brand-name versions of the newer hormone blockers, aromatase inhibitors, are $300 or more per month, but generics are available for much less.

The results pose a quandary for breast cancer patients past menopause and those who become menopausal because of their treatment—the vast majority of cases. Previous studies found that starting on one of the newer hormone blockers led to fewer relapses than initial treatment with tamoxifen did.

Another study found that switching to one of the new drugs after five years of tamoxifen cut the risk of breast cancer recurrence nearly in half—more than what was seen in the new study of 10 years of tamoxifen.

""For postmenopausal women, the data still remain much stronger at this point for a switch to an aromatase inhibitor,"" said that study's leader, Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital. He has been a paid speaker for a company that makes one of those drugs.

Women in his study have not been followed long enough to see whether switching cuts deaths from breast cancer, as 10 years of tamoxifen did. Results are expected in about a year.

The cancer conference is sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research, Baylor College of Medicine and the UT Health Science Center.

Breast cancer patients who double the length of time that they take a common medication can sharply reduce their risk of death, according to a new study that's predicted to influence medical practice.

The study involved an estrogen-blocking pill called tamoxifen, a standard therapy for the roughly two-thirds of breast cancer patients whose tumors are sensitive to estrogen. Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.

In the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.

In absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.

Overall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.

That's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.

""This is a dream come true for women,"" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. ""It's very exciting.""

Tamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

In the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Jordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.

Younger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.

Tamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.

Doctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.

Because the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.

Gray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.

Doctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.

Breast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.

Some women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.

""Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,"" says Shockney, 59. ""The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.""

Shockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. ""If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?"" Shockney asks.

Some patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.

Studies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.

Staley say she tamoxifen gave her ""many, many side effects,"" including severe hot flashes. ""Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain — you name it, I had it,"" she says.

After 2½ years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug ""to regain a measure of quality of life.""

For Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.

Patients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.

""If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,"" Shockney says.

Yet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.

""If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' """,Long-term treatment cuts breast cancer deaths,3,Cancer

WEDNESDAY, Dec. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- If colon cancer screening was as easy as taking a breath, more people might do it. Now, a small pilot study suggests such a test could be developed.

The study, of 78 people with and without colon cancer, found that those with the disease tended to have a distinct pattern of chemicals in their breath. And when researchers analyzed the study participants' breath samples, they correctly identified the colon cancer patients 76 percent of the time.

The findings, reported online Dec. 5 in the British Journal of Surgery, sound good. But if you're waiting for your doctor to offer such a test, don't hold your breath.

""It's an interesting concept, but this is in the very early stages,"" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colorectal cancers for the American Cancer Society.

""There's no way to tell if this would work in the general population,"" said Brooks, who was not involved in the research.

What's more, he added, there are already several good ways to catch colon cancer -- or, even better, precancerous growths called polyps, which can then be removed before a tumor develops. Yet about 40 percent of Americans who should be getting screened are not.

""Colon cancer is a highly preventable disease,"" Brooks said. ""And I would encourage the four out of 10 people who are not taking advantage of the existing screening tools to talk with their doctor.""

The idea of using a breath test to catch cancer is not new: Researchers are looking into breath tests for detecting a number of cancers, including lung and breast tumors. It's all based on studies showing that breath samples from cancer patients tend to have a distinguishing pattern of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

When it comes to colon cancer, people already have several options for screening, which for most adults should begin at age 50 -- or possibly earlier if you are at higher-than-normal risk.

The choices include a yearly stool test that looks for hidden blood, or either of two invasive tests that scope the colon: sigmoidoscopy every five years, along with stool testing every three years; or colonoscopy every 10 years.

But many people are turned off by those tests.

So Dr. Donato Altomare and colleagues at the University Aldo Moro in Bari, Italy, decided to test the feasibility of a breath test.

Analyzing breath samples from 37 patients with colon cancer and 41 healthy middle-aged adults, the researchers found 15 VOCs that seemed to differ between the two groups.

They then used a statistical model to see if certain VOC patterns separated the colon cancer patients from the healthy participants. In the end, the researchers were able to correctly identify the cancer patients 76 percent of the time.

But, Brooks pointed out, that also means the breath test was wrong about one-quarter of the time.

There's no way of knowing how well such a screening test would work in the real world -- including how many people might wrongly get a positive result and undergo needless invasive tests to follow up, Brooks said.

Another big question, he added, is whether breath analysis could pinpoint people with colon polyps.

""One of our goals in screening is to detect polyps, not cancer,"" Brooks said. ""This study doesn't address that.""

Altomare's team acknowledges that there is a lot of work left to do. It's still unclear which breath chemicals should be measured, or what statistical method is best for weeding out cases of colon cancer.

Brooks said it would be nice to have a very simple, accurate screening test -- whether that means a breath test or blood or urine tests. Yearly stool tests are simple and cheap, but people often don't want to do them.

""We're always searching for simpler things to do,"" Brooks said. But for now, he added, ""this study raises many more questions than answers.""

Similar research is under way to develop breathalyzer-like devices to detect lung, breast, prostate, and other cancers.

Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Peter Mazzone, MD, who is conducting lung cancer studies, says a breath test for cancer may be a reality in as little as five years if all goes well.

“But we are still in the research phase, and there is still the possibility that this technology will never prove clinically useful,” he says. “There is still quite a bit of work to be done.”

Mazzone says the breath functions in the body in much the same way that the exhaust system functions in a car, and what comes out gives a sense of how things are working inside.

A person’s breath contains a variety of chemical compounds, and it has long been recognized that certain illnesses can affect how the breath smells.

People with poorly controlled diabetes, for example, may have breath that smells fruity due to an overproduction of chemicals called ketones; people with kidney or liver failure can have fishy breath.

NASHVILLE -- Sick with depression, Harriet Bruce spent her days lying in bed for months at a time.

Pills didn't work. Neither did psychotherapy.

Then she agreed to a transcranial magnetic stimulation. The new treatment pushes powerful magnetic currents into the front of the brain, the part that controls emotions.

These days, Bruce awakens before her alarm goes off and dives into projects, including monster tasks she once dreaded.

""I have a room in my house in which I had stacked boxes from when we moved 10 years ago that I wanted to get to, but I couldn't do it,"" the Centerville woman said. ""But I've been working on that.""

Transcranial magnetic stimulation, once considered an experimental treatment for depression, is gaining acceptance since it came on the market four years ago. Beginning Saturday, Medicare will cover the treatments when other therapies have failed. This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.

Doctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.

The cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.

""We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,"" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.

The NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm — a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.

""When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,"" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.

Dr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.

""Most people are not scared of it,"" she said. ""It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You've got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You've got less side effects than taking a medicine.""

Both Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a ""significant effect of treatment"" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a ""sham"" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.

Depressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.

However, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare's medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.

""Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,"" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. ""Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.""

Cochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider. West is a Medicare provider.

Said West: ""Typically, when Medicare starts to cover something the excuse of experimental and investigational is no longer valid.""",Magnets zap blues for some with depression,3,USA Today

WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new insomnia drug helped people get a bit more shut-eye in a lab study, researchers report.

The drug, known as suvorexant, is being developed by Merck Research Laboratories, which funded and conducted the study. The medication is not available yet, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing it for possible approval, the researchers said.

In the United States, about 10 percent of people say they have chronic insomnia, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are sleep aids on the market, but they do not work for everyone and they can have side effects that include sleepwalking, daytime drowsiness and confusion.

Suvorexant works differently from those drugs, zeroing in on specific brain chemicals involved in the ability to sleep, explained study author Dr. William Herring, executive director of clinical research at Merck.

The study, published online Nov. 28 and in the Dec. 4 print issue of the journal Neurology, included 254 healthy adults with primary insomnia, which means it wasn't caused by an underlying physical or mental health problem.

All of the patients spent four weeks on one of four doses of suvorexant and another four weeks on placebo pills. They had their sleep monitored in a sleep lab on their first night with each treatment, and then came back again after four weeks.

Overall, Herring's team found, people slept better with the drug, although the improvement was not dramatic.

At the outset, when patients spent eight hours in bed, they were typically asleep for 66 percent of that time. One day on suvorexant boosted that by anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent, relative to the placebo. Between 21 and 37 fewer minutes were spent awake during those sleep periods.

There was still a benefit four weeks later. One expert pointed out, however, that the benefit was small.

""The amount of additional sleep was not tremendous,"" said Dr. Carl Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.

The effect was essentially comparable to what has been seen with other sleep medications, said Bazil, who was not involved in the research.

But, he said, suvorexant is seen as a potentially important development in the world of sleep medicine, because the drug blocks specific brain chemicals called orexins, which help keep people awake. Standard sleep medications work more widely throughout the brain, Bazil explained, which is why they can have a host of side effects.

""The way [suvorexant] works makes a lot of sense,"" Bazil said. ""The hope is that it will help some people who haven't responded to [other drugs], and have fewer side effects.""

It's promising news, Bazil added, that there were no serious side effects in this study.

The most common side effects were sleepiness (reported by about 10 percent of patients on the two higher doses of suvorexant), headache (reported by about 5 percent), dizziness and abnormal dreams (5 percent).

There are still many questions, including whether the drug would benefit people with insomnia due to a health condition, which doctors call secondary insomnia.

The study also excluded adults aged 65 or older -- an age group commonly affected by insomnia. But, Herring said, seniors were part of a larger, 12-month trial, and Merck has submitted those results to the FDA.

Another sleep specialist said the findings show ""some potential benefit"" from suvorexant, but he cautioned insomnia sufferers against relying completely on any drug.

""Medication can be important,"" said Dr. William Kohler, who directs the Florida Sleep Institute in Spring Hill. ""But in the long run, the best methods for treating insomnia are behavioral techniques.""

Kohler said cognitive behavioral therapy -- where people learn to change the thoughts and habits that affect their sleep quality -- is a proven way to manage insomnia. For most people, he said, medication should be a temporary treatment; behavior change is the long-term fix.

Bazil agreed: ""I look at most people with insomnia as someone who developed bad sleep habits.""

A drug, ideally used for a short time, may help encourage sleep and get people on the right track, Bazil said. ""But those bad sleep habits -- you've got to address them too,"" he added.

""The problem,"" Kohler noted, ""is that we don't want to make behavior changes. We want to pop a pill.""

WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to suffer hip dislocation after hip replacement surgery than those with osteoarthritis, a new study says.

In addition, rheumatoid arthritis patients have a higher infection risk after total knee replacement than osteoarthritis patients, the study authors found.

Rheumatoid arthritis, which is felt throughout the whole body, is caused when a person's immune system attacks his or her own tissues. Osteoarthritis, which is usually felt only in the joints, is caused by wear and tear on the body.

For the study, the investigators analyzed the findings of 40 studies published between January 1990 and December 2011. The studies included arthritis patients aged 18 or older who had hip or knee replacements.

The findings are published in the Nov. 28 online edition of Arthritis & Rheumatism.

""Joint arthroplasty is successful in relieving the pain and disability caused by hip or knee arthritis,"" study author Dr. Bheeshma Ravi, from the University of Toronto and Women's College Research Institute, said in a journal news release. ""While complication rates are low, there are some cases with serious consequences that include infection, joint dislocation, blood clots and even death.""

The study team found no differences between the two groups of arthritis patients in rates of follow-up surgery, or 90-day blood clot or death risk.

Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1.3 million people in the United States, while osteoarthritis affects 27 million Americans aged 25 and older, according to the American College of Rheumatology.

One of the fastest-growing dietary supplements, probiotics are now prominent on drug and big-box store shelves. They are live microorganisms—or ""good"" bacteria—that when consumed in capsules or yogurt are said to confer a health benefit. So far, however, there is little scientific proof of their effectiveness—many studies of probiotics have involved less-than-rigorous research standards.

As further data become available, some researchers believe probiotics may evolve into prescription drugs, as doctors focus on specific bacteria strains to target patients' particular conditions. At the moment, however, many experts say probiotics are misunderstood.

""Consumers have shown to be willing to spend the money, just in case [probiotics] work,"" says Michael Fischbach, an assistant professor of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. ""What we all have to be careful about is to not view them as a panacea and to make sure that we don't raise our expectations too high.""

Activia is one of a number of yogurts that contain probiotics. Dannon

U.S. sales of probiotic supplements totaled nearly $770 million last year, up some 22% from the previous year, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.

The strongest clinical studies have suggested some probiotics may be beneficial for certain gastrointestinal problems, allergies and vaginal infections. Many doctors recommend probiotics when patients are taking antibiotics. Probiotics are widely considered safe except for people with an impaired immune system, though experts recommend talking to a doctor first.

For other ailments, hundreds of probiotic studies are currently under way, experts say. In a report last month in the British Journal of Nutrition, researchers at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-School of Health Related Professions said a combination of two probiotics may reduce the symptoms and recovery time for the common cold. Other studies have shown similar results, especially with children.

Researchers this month presented evidence at a meeting of the American Heart Association showing that two daily doses of a probiotic lowered bad cholesterol by nearly 12% and reduced total and saturated cholesterol esters which contribute to the hardening of arteries. The study was funded by Micropharma Ltd., a Canadian probiotic research and production company.

Some studies have federal backing. UCSF is exploring possible effects of probiotics on infants and early markers of asthma, as well as on colic. Harvard Medical School researchers are studying what good bacteria might do for the immune system to see if the response to flu vaccine in elderly people can be improved.

The body contains trillions of bacteria, both good and bad. Most live in the gut but they also colonize other areas. Good bacteria help digest food, produce vitamins and protect from infections, among other things.

can affect the body differently. Strains should be listed on a product label. Probiotics are largely unregulated but they can't make claims to cure or prevent a disease.

The community of bacteria, the body's intestinal flora, begins at birth, says Esi Lamousé-Smith, an instructor in medicine at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. By age 3 these bacteria, sometimes referred to as our gut or intestinal microbiome, are more or less set, she says. Each person's microbiome is distinct and doesn't change significantly with age unless a person becomes ill, takes an antibiotic or makes major changes in diet.

A probiotic, which adds good bacteria only for the time it is being taken, seems to influence other bacteria already present. For example, it might stimulate other bacteria to turn on or off certain genes. These genes, in turn, might be involved in various functions, such as immune regulation or nutrient metabolism.

""I am wholeheartedly a believer"" in probiotics, says Maureen Fitzgerald, a Germantown, Wis., resident who blogs about parenting issues.

As a former teacher, Ms. Fitzgerald was exposed to many germs and says she was looking for something to ""beef up"" her immune system. Once she started regularly taking probiotics she says she wasn't ""getting as many of the colds and the bugs that are around."" About five years ago, Ms. Fitzgerald's then 3-year-old son began taking a children's probiotic that cleared up digestion problems he was having. After that, Ms. Fitzgerald says she was hooked on the supplements. She raved about probiotics on her blog and has since received free samples, which she reviews.

There are many different strains of probiotics and each may affect the body differently. The dosage—or number of colony-forming units—in a probiotic is also important. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are the two most widely studied types of probiotics. Lactobacillus rhamnosus, widely known as LGG, may treat viral and antibiotic-induced diarrhea, and certain allergies, like childhood eczema. A strain of Lactobacillus reuteri has been shown to help with colic. Bifidobacterium animalis, found in some brands of yogurt, is said to improve digestion.

Experts say taking a probiotic supplement with many bacterial strains isn't necessarily better. The key is ensuring each strain in a product is active and has been clinically proven to work at a certain dosage, they say. Tests done by ConsumerLab.com have shown that the number of living organisms in probiotics doesn't always reflect the label. Of 12 products tested this year, two delivered fewer organisms than listed.

Probiotics aren't required to obtain Food and Drug Administration approval before being marketed. ""Right now they're considered a food product or dietary supplement, not a drug,"" says Gerard Mullin, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of ""The Inside Tract.""

There aren't any FDA approved health claims for probiotics, says Diane Hoffmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland Carey School of Law, who oversaw a study on the federal regulation of probiotics. But companies can make broader statements, called ""structure function"" claims. It is the difference between saying a product reduces the risk of heart disease versus supports a healthy heart. Because the difference isn't discernible to many consumers, there is little incentive in the industry to pursue costlier and more resource-intensive health claims.

""Consumers just need to know that claims are not necessarily preapproved and they may not be well substantiated,"" says Ms. Hoffmann.

In the short term, experts recommend sticking with the strains of probiotics that have a lot of science behind them, like Lactobacillus GG, and brands that have proven to be safe and truthful in labeling.

Dr. Mullin, of Johns Hopkins, says the future may lie in concocting specific probiotics for people based upon their individual needs and microbiomes.

story_reviews_00787,"Nov. 18, 2012 -- Researchers say they've been able to use nanoparticles to stop multiple sclerosis (MS) in mice that are bred to have the disease.

The particles are about 200 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. They are made from the same material that's used to create dissolving stitches.

When researchers attach specific proteins to the particles, they say they're able to teach the body not to attack its own tissues.

If the approach succeeds in human studies, it may one day lead to more targeted treatments not only for multiple sclerosis but also for other kinds of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

“This technology could be very effective,” says Timothy Coetzee, PhD, chief research officer for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

What remains to be seen is whether the researchers have picked the right proteins that might turn off the disease in humans, he says.

“Will these peptides actually induce tolerance in people? We just don’t know. It’s rational, but we won’t know until we get it into people,” says Coetzee, who was not involved in the research.

The research is published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Myelin Repair Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and the Australian government.",Nanoparticles Show Potential for Treating MS,3,WebMD
story_reviews_00788,"Researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they’ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with MS, but those with a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.

So far it’s only worked in mice, but it has worked especially well. And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.

“If this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,” said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. “Even if it doesn’t work, it’s going to be another step down the road.”

In autoimmune disease, the body’s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it’s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it’s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it’s tissue in the joint.

Currently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.

The approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They’re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday’s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.

Stephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.

The macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It’s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body’s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.

Miller’s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.

The idea would be to “introduce” the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were “meeting” the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.

So far the team has only shown the process is safe – a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients’ immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. “It cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,” he said.

Obviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.

These new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn’t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.

Shea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. “It turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,” said Miller.

“There is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,” said NIBIB’s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.

This worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they’re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles “meet” the T-cells.

If the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.

What’s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. “You can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,” he said.

One shortcoming is that scientists don’t always know what’s causing an autoimmune disease. “We know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don’t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,” Miller said.

Now the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They’re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.

Mice don’t live very long, and it’s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments. But the T-cells that are re-educated usually live for a long time in the body, and have long memories, Miller said.

It’s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease, so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms. But it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients, Miller said.

TUESDAY, Nov. 13, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For black Americans suffering from heart disease, meditation might help prevent heart attacks, strokes and early death, a small new study suggests.

These benefits appear to be the results of meditation's ability to lower blood pressure, stress and anger, all of which have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk, researchers say.

""This is a whole new physiological effect on top of conventional treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Robert Schneider, director of the Institute for Natural Medicine and Prevention in Fairfield, Iowa. ""People can prevent heart disease reoccurrence using their own mind-body connection. People have this internal self-healing ability.""

An outside expert, however, said the study is too limited in size and scope to allow conclusions as to whether meditation really reduces risk of death or disease.

The new study focused on Transcendental Meditation. Originally from India, it is not associated with any particular religion or philosophy. It is thought to produce alpha brain waves that occur in deep relaxation. According to the Maharishi Foundation, more than 5 million people worldwide practice this type of meditation.

The research focused on blacks because they are at a higher risk than whites of having heart attacks and strokes and dying from heart disease, Schneider said. He added, however, that meditation would work as well among whites and other populations.

""Other studies have been done among whites and the results are similar,"" he said.

The report was published in the Nov. 13 issue of the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. The study was sponsored by the Maharishi University of Management and funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

For the study, Schneider's team randomly assigned 201 black Americans with heart disease either to a Transcendental Meditation stress-reducing program or health education class about lifestyle modification in diet and exercise.

Almost 60 percent of the participants were taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Forty-one percent of the meditation group took aspirin, as did 31 percent of the health education group; 38 percent of the meditation group and 43 percent of the health education group smoked, the researchers noted.

Participants' average body-mass index -- a measurement of body fat based on height and weight -- was 32, which is considered obese.

Meditation consisted of sitting with eyes closed for about 20 minutes twice a day. The goal was to rest while remaining alert.

After more than five years of follow-up, the researchers found those who meditated saw significant reductions in blood pressure and anger compared to those receiving health education. In addition, 20 people in the medication group had a heart attack or stroke or died, compared with 32 in the health education group.

Both groups increased exercise and drank less. For those who meditated, there was a trend toward reduced smoking; however, this was not statistically significant.

Learning how to do Transcendental Meditation isn't inexpensive. An initial 10-hour course runs about $1,500 when taught by nonprofit groups, and there is continued lifetime follow-up, Schneider said.

And it's not something you can learn by yourself. ""You've got to have a teacher right there in front of you teaching according to experience,"" he said. ""So it's only learned live.""

Transcendental Meditation is not generally covered by health insurance, he said. ""One of the reasons we did the study is because insurance and Medicare calls for citing evidence for what's to be reimbursed,"" Schneider said. ""This study will lead toward reimbursement. That's the whole idea.""

But a cardiology expert said that although the study adds to evidence supporting meditation, it doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the practice and better health outcomes.

""Transcendental Meditation has been reported to have health benefits and has been evaluated in a number of studies,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Some studies have suggested favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors whereas others studies have been inconclusive, he said.

Even though the findings in this study were statistically significant, the new study was too small to be conclusive, Fonarow said.

""In addition, since this study was conducted at a single center and the primary [change in heart attack, stroke and death] was not statistically significant without adjustment for other factors, more studies and replication of these findings are needed,"" he said.

Most doctors say meditation can’t hurt you, but now there’s reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease.

Previous studies have linked better health outcomes among heart patients who practiced meditation compared to those who did not, but none of those trials could definitively credit the brain-focusing program with the better health results. In the latest trial to address those limitations, however, meditation does appear to have an effect on reducing heart attack, stroke and even early death from heart disease, at least among African-Americans.

MORE: Losing Focus? Studies Say Meditation May Help

“The main finding [of our research] is that, added on top of usual medical care, intervention with a mind-body technique — transcendental meditation — can have a major effect on cardiovascular events,” says Robert Schneider, lead author on the study published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes and a professor at the Maharishi University of Management, an institution in Iowa that was founded by the creator of transcendental meditation.

He and his colleagues followed 201 African American men and women, who are at higher risk of heart disease than whites, but who also had addition reason to worry about heart attacks and strokes since they were also diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.

After roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. “It’s like discovering a whole new class of medications,” Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients’ health.

But while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it’s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.

But many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.

MORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?

The great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.

While the findings aren’t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that’s an improvement over the advice that “it can’t hurt to try.”

In people with osteoarthritis, the cartilage in a joint wears away in some areas. The function of cartilage is to reduce friction in the joints and serve as a ""shock absorber."" The wearing away of cartilage leads to pain and other symptoms.

Nearly one in 100 people have evidence of knee osteoarthritis on an X-ray. And nearly 19% of women and 14% of men age 45 and older have joint pain, stiffness, and other symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, according to a large 2007 study.

story_reviews_00792,"The ancient art of applying suction cups to the body has gotten a boost from several new studies that show it helps relieve a variety of painful conditions. But scientists say larger, more rigorous studies are needed.

In fire cupping, burning cotton is placed inside a glass cup, which creates a vacuum as it cools.

Cupping, as the practice is called, was performed traditionally in China and other countries, and is now available from acupuncturists, and some chiropractors and massage therapists in the U.S. In the traditional method, called fire cupping, a ball of burning cotton is briefly placed inside a glass cup to heat the air inside, which then creates a partial vacuum as it cools. Newer-style plastic or silicone cups have valves that attach to hand pumps used to create suction.

Until recently, there was scant published evidence in favor of cupping for pain relief. Over the past three years, a handful of new studies have shown it helps relieve back, neck, carpal tunnel and knee pain.

There are a number of theories on how cupping may work to relieve pain. A widely held one is that suction on the skin ""increases blood flow to the area and creates a mild immune response,"" says Kathleen Lumiere, an assistant professor of acupuncture and oriental medicine at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Wash. It also helps release fascia, connective tissue that can pull on muscles causing pain or limited motion, clinicians say.

Typically cups are on for up to 20 minutes and leave a temporary reddish mark that looks ""like rare roast beef,"" says Brian K. Nathanson, a Norwalk, Conn., chiropractor who has been doing cupping for about five years.

Some clinicians slide the cups on the body, using them as massage tools in a technique sometimes called running cupping. ""People who love deep-tissue massage love cupping,"" says Gabrielle Francis, a Manhattan chiropractor and acupuncturist who does both static cupping and running cupping. Both can cause mild discomfort in some patients, clinicians say.

Cupping is an ancient healing art that was traditionally practiced in China, the Middle East and other countries. Corbis

The intrepid can opt for ""wet cupping,"" in which the skin is punctured with a lancet before the cups are applied. The technique, which draws out a small quantity of blood, can have a powerful effect—particularly on areas where you can feel a hard lump of knotted muscles, says Kristine Tohtz, a Chicago chiropractor and acupuncturist who does wet and dry cupping.

Cost of cupping varies widely, from $40 to $100 or more for a half-hour session. It shouldn't be done on pregnant women, people with heart conditions or people with bleeding disorders, clinicians say. Caution should be used if a person has thin skin that might tear easily.

In a study of people with neck pain caused by computer use, ""cupping therapy was effective in reducing pain,"" says Tae-Hun Kim, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine in Daejeon, South Korea. The 40-person study, published online in September in the Journal of Occupational Health, found that six cupping sessions over two weeks was more effective on average in relieving pain than a heating pad—and the benefit lasted a month after treatment ended.

But, says Romy Lauche, a scientist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Essen, Germany, ""the studies are very preliminary. We cannot say it has proven its efficacy.""

Dr. Lauche co-authored a 50-person study published last year that found a single wet-cupping treatment on average significantly reduced chronic neck pain three days after the treatment, compared with a control group that had no treatment. Location of the cups varied with each patient but typically was on the trapezius muscle, which spans the neck, shoulders and upper back. In unpublished results, she adds, scientists found the pain relief lasted for months.

In a 40-person German study published in October, cupping therapy significantly relieved knee arthritis pain compared with patients who received no treatment. But the study's lack of a control group treated with a sham technique ""raises questions of whether it is cupping that is really working or if it has a placebo effect,"" says David Felson, who directs an arthritis research program at Boston University School of Medicine.

Dr. Lauche agrees that lack of a placebo control is a flaw in the studies. A new study, currently ongoing for fibromyalgia pain, is testing cupping against a sham cup that attaches with adhesive and provides minimal suction, she says.

The goal of the new treatment is to reduce the high risk of a second heart attack in people who have had a heart attack.

In the year after a heart attack, about 12% of people have a second heart attack or stroke. And half of them happen in the first month, says researcher Andreas Gille, MD, PhD. Gille is head of clinical and translational science strategy at CSL Limited (which funded the study) in Parkville, Australia.

Standard heart attack medications, such as aspirin and anti-clotting drugs, prevent clotting but don’t eliminate an underlying factor: cholesterol that has built up on artery walls, he says.

story_reviews_00794,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s experimental drug AMG145 reduced levels of bad cholesterol by as much as 55 percent in combination with statin drugs in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, according to data from a midstage trial presented on Monday.

The new drug, given by injection every four weeks, is part of a promising new class of biotech medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.

Statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor, work by preventing the liver from making cholesterol.

The Phase II trial found that after 12 weeks, patients treated with a low dose of AMG145 had a 43 percent reduction in LDL, while those given a higher dose had a drop of 55 percent. Patients treated with a placebo saw a 1 percent increase in LDL cholesterol.

The trial, presented here at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association, included 168 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in which a defective gene inherited from one parent impairs the ability to properly metabolize LDL. The disorder is estimated to affect about one in 500 people and causes extremely high cholesterol.

The most common side effects seen in the trial were injection-site reactions, cold-like symptoms and headache.

MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug may help patients who can't tolerate statins lower their cholesterol, a new Australian study suggests.

The 12-week, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at 33 international sites and included adults who suffered muscle problems when taking statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that includes Crestor and Lipitor. They received injections of a placebo or different doses of AMG145, which is a human monoclonal antibody.

Human monoclonal antibodies are naturally occurring human antibodies that are genetically altered in a laboratory, cloned in large numbers and introduced into the patient to target disease sites.

The patients who received AMG145 had 41 percent to 63 percent reductions in ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol and did not experience significant muscle-related side effects, said study leader Dr. David Sullivan, of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia, and colleagues.

The reductions in LDL cholesterol seen in these patients were comparable to those that occur in patients taking the highest doses of the most effective statins, the researchers added.

One expert found the results intriguing.

""The most interesting aspect of this study is use of a novel approach using monoclonal antibodies -- a subtype of antibodies -- in the management of elevated LDL cholesterol,"" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center.

""In this phase 2 study, the results are certainly impressive and warrant further investigation,"" Ong said. ""Of note is the reduction in the number of myalgias (muscle pains) for patients compared to the number of myalgias experienced by people taking statins. If larger trials and longer durations of observation confirm these initial findings, many patients whose LDL cholesterol are otherwise untreated or under-treated could benefit.""

Another expert agreed.

""For those patients with elevated LDL who are intolerant to statins, this provides a viable option,"" said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. More trials need to be done of this unique treatment, she added.

The study was published online Nov. 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, to coincide with a planned presentation at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Los Angeles.

A heart disease study presented Sunday is being called a $32 million waste of time — and even a danger to public health — by some of the country's leading health experts.

The taxpayer-funded study tested whether a controversial alternative therapy, called chelation, could reduce heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems in people who had already survived a heart attack.

Chelation therapy, which can remove metals from the blood, is a risky procedure approved to treat rare, life-threatening cases of heavy metal poisoning. Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure ""off-label,"" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer's to autism.

National Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe.

In a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes.

Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study.

""Kudos for funding a trial that says, 'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let's let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,'"" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled.

In a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, ""Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice.""

Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.

Cardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA's most respected heart experts, says he's concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease.

""This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,"" Nissen says. Chelation ""should not be administered to any patients for the indication of heart disease. ... There are a lot of people, including me, who believe this was a poor use of taxpayer dollars.""

At least 30 patients have died from off-label chelation therapy since the 1970s, including an autistic 5-year-old Pennsylvania boy, according to a 2008 report in The Medscape Journal of Medicine.

Even the study's lead author says the research should not be used to recommend chelation therapy, and he acknowledges that its findings could have been due to chance.

""A definitive answer on chelation therapy will take much additional research,"" Gervasio Lamas, chief of the Columbia University division of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla., said in a statement. ""The most exciting part of this study is that there may be an unexpected signal of benefit. We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance.""

The trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago.

The study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation's risks.

In response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms — the documents that explain a study's risks and benefits to patients — which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy.

Federal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.

Stephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he's also concerned about the reliability of its findings.

The overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance — the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke — by only 0.001.

Further analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall.

Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning.

This study's findings are even more questionable, however, Kopecky says, because patients who got chelation had lower bad cholesterol levels than the placebo group at the start of the trial. That could explain most of their reduced risk for a second heart attack, says Kopecky, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology.

In addition, 30% of patients stopped getting their assigned treatments, and 17% withdrew their consent, preventing doctors from including their data or even contacting them to see if they were still alive, Kopecky says.

That large of a dropout rate — which is normally no more than about 3% — could skew the study's findings, Kopecky says.

""That's a big concern any time a study shows a benefit on something that's not highly regulated by the FDA,"" Kopecky says.

Kopecky also acknowledges that there's no known biological basis for why removing metals from the blood would help heart disease. ""That is a million-dollar question,"" he said.

More than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation, says Paul Armstrong, a professor of cardiology at the University of Alberta, chosen to discuss the study on a panel at the heart meeting. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says.

""All of these factors call into question the results,"" says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen's Health Research Group.

NIH officials say the trial was worthwhile. Gary Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, says the study was a ""breakthrough"" not for proving that chelation works, but for ""establishing that this chelation therapy regimen can be administered in a safe manner in the context of a clinical trial.""",Researchers raise concerns over chelation heart study,5,Diabetes
story_reviews_00798,"Oct. 29, 2012 -- Early, intensive autism treatment improves children's brain development, a new study shows.

The treatment, dubbed Early Start Denver Model or ESDM, offers a child 20 hours a week of one-on-one treatment with a trained therapist. It also calls for many more hours of the treatment, in the form of structured play, with a parent trained in the technique.

By age 4, children given the treatment had higher IQ scores, more adaptive behavior, better coordination, and a less severe autism diagnosis than kids given the standard autism treatments offered in their communities. But that's not all, researchers Geraldine Dawson, PhD, and colleagues report.

""We jump-started and improved the responses of children's brains to social information,"" says Dawson, professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina and chief science officer at Autism Speaks.

Normal child development depends on interactions with parents and other people. Without such interactions, language and social skills do not develop.

As measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG), small children's brains show a specific pattern of activity when they look at a picture of a human face. This doesn't happen when they look at pictures of inanimate objects.

Just the reverse happens in children with autism. Their brains light up when they look at pictures of objects, but not when they look at faces. This changed dramatically in the children treated with ESDM.

story_reviews_00799,"A compound in raspberries is being touted as the next new fat burner. But people looking to lose a few pounds may not want to go running to the produce aisle just yet. Scientists say there are no major human studies to support the idea that a berry holds the secret to weight loss.

Some new weight-loss supplements, such as one from Swanson Health Products, center, use the Razberi-K brand of raspberry ketones, while others mix the ketones with substances, such as Reserveage Organics's Green Coffee Bean Extract, second from left.

Raspberry ketones, the organic compounds that give raspberries their aroma, raised hopes as a weight-loss aid after a 2005 study by Japanese researchers found the ketones boosted fat-burning processes in rat cells in a laboratory as long as those cells were also exposed to a hormone known to help break up fat. The study, funded by a Japanese company developing a diet product no longer on the market, found that mice fed a high-fat diet plus raspberry ketones gained less weight than mice fed the high fat diet alone.

Since you'd have to eat a lot of raspberries to consume even a small amount of ketones, the compounds are being sold in a number of new weight-loss supplements. Some of the products use ketones extracted from real raspberries. Often they are synthetically manufactured in a laboratory, as is Razberi-K, a branded form of raspberry ketones sold by FHG Corp., in Spring Hill, Tenn., and used in about 30 companies' products.

""Razberi-K is perfect for those seeking stimulant-free support for a healthy weight-management program,"" says the website of Swanson Health Products Inc. in Fargo, N.D., which uses FHG's ingredient in its raspberry-ketone dietary supplement. The capsules, which went on sale last year, cost $3.79 for a month's supply of 100-milligram capsules taken twice daily, the company says.

The growing popularity of raspberry ketones comes despite no major human published studies. ""There is inadequate human data to support the idea that [raspberry ketones] actually cause weight loss,"" say Louis J. Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight-Control Program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York. Substances that cause weight loss in mice rarely end up working in humans, he adds.

Natural Standard Research Collaboration is a scientist-owned group that evaluates natural therapies. In a recently-updated review, it gave raspberry ketones for weight loss a grade of ""C,"" which means the scientific evidence is unclear. ""It has not been well studied or well proven in the data we've uncovered to this point,"" says Catherine Ulbricht, co-founder of the Cambridge, Mass., group.

A study published by a Korean researcher in 2010 found adding raspberry ketones to fat cells in a laboratory stimulated production of adiponectin—touted by some companies as a fat burner. It is true that adiponectin is a beneficial protein, says University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center scientist Philipp E. Scherer, but its main known benefits are reducing the risk of diabetes and helping to redistribute fat away from unhealthy areas, such as the liver and belly.

So far adiponectin doesn't seem helpful in weight loss, he adds, and in fact studies of mice genetically altered to make more adiponectin showed the animals actually gained weight. That doesn't mean humans will gain weight if they make more adiponectin. ""The idea that it would actually cause weight loss is probably incorrect,"" says Dr. Scherer.

The Japanese study states that the chemical structure of raspberry ketones is similar to synephrine, a stimulant. For this reason people with cardiac issues or high blood pressure should avoid them, says Dr. Aronne.

Tim Ziegenfuss, who conducted a 10-person monthlong human safety study of Razberi-K, says there were no side effects and none of the subjects reported feeling jittery. Dr. Ziegenfuss declined to provide a copy of the study's results for this column. FHG, which funded the study and does business as Integrity Nutraceuticals, also declined to provide a copy. The company says adiponectin is only ""one part of the complex puzzle"" and shouldn't be used to determine if the product is effective. FHG said it has had no customer complaints of stimulant-like side effects.

The Japanese study used synthetic ketones, according to study lead author Chie Morimoto, an associate professor at Matsuyama Shinonome Junior College in Japan. But several companies use natural ketones as a selling point. Simply Raspberry Ketones, a product from JJSmith Group Inc.'s aProvenProduct.com unit, contains the ""purest natural"" ketones and sells for a suggested retail price of $68 for a month's supply of 500 milligram capsules, according to the company's website.

Several companies mix raspberry ketones with other natural weight-loss remedies that have been studied more. ""We're encouraged"" by the raspberry ketone research, says Rob Maru, president of innovation and brand development at Reserveage Organics LLC, in Gainesville, Fla., but ""as a stand-alone it doesn't comply with our standards"" for sufficient human research. The company's Advanced Solutions Green Coffee Bean Extract with raspberry ketones, costs $34.99 for a month's supply.

Women sweltering under a plague of hot flashes might consider an old strategy to reduce their misery, says new research: harnessing the power of suggestion. Clinical hypnosis that prompted women to chill in the face of hot flashes was highly effective, says a new study, driving down both the number and the severity of episodes that women suffered and improving sleep quality and the extent to which the episodes interfered with daily life.

The post-menopausal women in this trial suffered at least eight hot flashes a day -- as many as 50 a week.

Although hormone replacement therapy has been found highly effective in reducing the physical symptoms that accompany midlife hormonal changes, its safety for all women is widely debated. The landmark Women's Health Initiative study suggested that treatments that combine estrogen and progesterone might raise a woman's likelihood of dementia, stroke and breast cancer. Other medications used to treat hot flashes -- the blood-pressure medication clonidine, the antidepressant paroxetine and the anti-seizure medication gapapentin -- can have unacceptable side effects as well.

Hypnosis, by contrast, comes with no known risks. It is among the many non-drug treatments to which women turn for hot flash relief. In trials, the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM) has found that yoga, acupuncture, qi gong and some meditation-based therapies can be effective in reducing menopausal symptoms. But black cohosh, an herbal supplement, has proved largely ineffective.

The latest research, published online in the journal Menopause, compared the effects of five 45-minute sessions of therapeutic hypnosis with those of a placebo treatment in which a therapist listened attentively to a subject's complaints for five sessions. For the 93 post-menopausal women who got the hypnosis treatment, the sessions included hypnotic induction, instructions for self-hypnosis and specific suggestions for mental imagery that would conjure the comforting sensations of coolness, relaxation and safe places.

On several measures, including a gauge of skin-conductance that detected a rise in body temperature, the subjects who got the hypnotherapy sessions experienced a marked improvement in their experience of menopausal symptoms.

The frequency of hot flashes in the hypnotherapy group dropped by 48% at six weeks and 56% at 12 weeks, compared to drops of 7% and 13% at six and 12 weeks, respectively, among those in the trial's control condition. A measure of the severity and frequency of hot flashes showed an average 71% improvement in the hypnosis group at six weeks versus 8% in the control group -- and an 80% improvement at the 12-week mark among the women who got hypnosis versus 15% at 12 weeks.

Hypnotherapy also reduced hot flashes measured by electrodes that showed changes in skin conductance that would be seen with hot flashes. At six weeks, women in the hypnotherapy group had 41% fewer hot flashes than at the outset and 57% fewer hot flashes at 12 weeks, while those in the control group experienced a slight rise in hot flashes at six week and a 10% drop at 12 weeks.","You are getting cooler: Hypnosis works for hot flashes, study finds",3,Los Angeles Times

The alternative therapy reduced hot flashes by as much as 74% in the study conducted by researchers at Baylor University’s Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Only hormone therapy, which many women can’t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R. Elkins, PhD. “If you compare this treatment with off-label use of antidepressants or other non-hormonal therapies, it works as well or better,” he says.

The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others.

story_reviews_00802,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel-based Neuronix, which has developed a non-invasive medical device to help to treat Alzheimer’s disease, expects the system to be approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in late 2014.

The device, which combines electromagnetic stimulation with computer-based cognitive training, is already approved for use in Europe, Israel and several Asian countries such as Singapore.

“You stimulate the brain on a biological level as well as on a cognitive level,” Neuronix CEO Eyal Baror told Reuters, saying this double approach created longer-lasting benefits.

The device, which consists of a chair containing an electronic system and software in the back and a coil placed at the head, has been tested on mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients who suffer from dementia but are not totally dependent.

The system is in trials at Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Patients are treated for one hour a day, five days a week over six weeks.

“We see improvement lasting for 9-12 months and the good thing is that patients can return and undergo treatment again,” Baror said. “If out of 10 years the patients have left to live we can keep them at home in a relatively mild state of the disease for three, four, five years, it’s a lot.”

According to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the hospital’s Berenson-Allen Centre for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, brain stimulation - or transcranial magnetic stimulation - involves a very low current applied to a specific part of the brain and is approved by the FDA for treatment of a variety of ailments and diagnostic applications.

“The application in Alzheimer’s disease and in combination with cognitive training is novel,” Pascual-Leono said in a phone interview from Boston.

About 20 percent of patients experience a mild headache but there are no long-term negative effects, he said.

Pascual-Leone, who is principal investigator in the Harvard trial, said that of 12 patients in the study, six received the real treatment and all showed cognitive improvement. Their improvement was significantly more than the average seen in patients taking just medication, he said.

The study’s results will be submitted for publication in the coming weeks and a follow-up study on 30 patients is planned.

Neuronix received European approval several months ago and has installations in the UK and Germany. In Israel, a few dozen patients are being treated with the device.

The U.S. trials are expected to run till the end of 2013. Neuronix is also running a trial in Israel for pre-Alzheimer’s patients.

The company expects to sell half a dozen systems in the second half of 2012 and three dozen in 2013. In Israel, the treatment costs $6,000.

“Our target for becoming profitable is in parallel to entering the U.S. market around 2015,” Baror said.

America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found.

The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems.

In the new study, multivitamins cut the chance of developing cancer by 8%. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say.

Multivitamins also may have different results in women, younger men or people less healthy than those in this study.

""It's a very mild effect and personally I'm not sure it's significant enough to recommend to anyone"" although it is promising, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, vice president of cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and formerly of the National Cancer Institute.

""At least this doesn't suggest a harm"" as some previous studies on single vitamins have, he said.

Hawk reviewed the study for the American Association for Cancer Research, which is meeting in Anaheim, Calif., where the study was to be presented on Wednesday. It also was published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

About one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. They are marketed as a kind of insurance policy against bad eating. Yet no government agency recommends their routine use ""regardless of the quality of a person's diet,"" says a fact sheet from the federal Office of Dietary Supplements.

Some fads, such as the antioxidant craze over vitamins A and E and beta-carotene, backfired when studies found more health risk with those supplements, not less. Many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the ""100% of daily value"" amounts that multivitamins typically contain.

Science on vitamins has been skimpy. Most studies have been observational — they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions.

Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and VA Boston, led a stronger test. Nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of Centrum Silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received.

After about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.

Multivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer, which accounted for half of all cases. They lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12%. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.

Side effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study. Pfizer Inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging.

The main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency, ""but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men,"" Gaziano said.

Cancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public. These participants were healthier — only 4% smoked, for example.

For people who do want to take multivitamins, doctors suggest:

— Be aware that they are dietary supplements, which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines.

— Ask your doctor before taking any. Vitamin K can interfere with common heart medicines and blood thinners, and vitamins C and E can lower the effectiveness of some types of chemotherapy. For people having surgery, some vitamins affect bleeding and response to anesthesia.

— Current and former smokers should avoid multivitamins with lots of beta-carotene or vitamin A; two studies have tied them to increased risk of lung cancer.",Study: Multivitamins may lower cancer risk in men,5,Associated Press
story_reviews_00804,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Swallowing a daily multivitamin can reduce the risk of cancer by at least eight percent in middle-aged and older men and appears to have no dangerous side-effects, according to the first large-scale, randomized study on the subject.

The protective effect of the daily pill was described as “modest” by the trial investigators who emphasized that the primary use of vitamins was to prevent nutritional deficiencies. The findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and presented on Wednesday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Anaheim, California.

“This is indeed a landmark study,” said Cory Abate-Shen, a professor of urological oncology at Columbia University Medical Center who was not involved in the trial. “It suggests that a balanced multivitamin approach is probably more beneficial than increasing to high levels any one vitamin.”

About half of U.S. adults take at least one daily dietary supplement - the most popular being a multivitamin, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The U.S. Physicians Health Study II included nearly 50,000 male doctors aged 50 and older and spanned more than 10 years. Participants were randomly assigned to a multivitamin - Pfizer Inc’s Centrum Silver - or a placebo. The research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.

Several previous studies, many relying on self-reported use of specific vitamins or supplements, have generated mixed results in terms of cancer outcomes.

“There have been some other trials that have tested combinations, often at high doses, of certain vitamins and minerals,” said Dr. Howard Sesso, one of the study’s authors and an associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Our trial took a very commonly used multivitamin that has basically low levels of all the different essential vitamins and minerals.”

The findings suggest that the biggest health benefit may come from a broad combination of dietary supplements, he said.

EFFECT IS GREATER FOR NON-PROSTATE CANCERS

Last year, the questionnaire-based Iowa Women’s Health Study found that older women who take multivitamins have slightly increased death rates compared to those who don’t.

A study examining whether vitamin E and selenium could reduce the risk of prostate cancer was stopped prematurely in 2008 after men taking 400 international units (IU) of the vitamin showed an increased risk of developing the cancer. Over-the-counter multivitamins typically contain 15 to 25 IU of vitamin E.

The newly-released Physicians Health Study showed an 8 percent reduction in total cancer occurrence for participants taking a multivitamin, but no benefit was seen for rates of prostate cancer, the most common cancer seen among the participants in the study.

Excluding prostate cancer, researchers found about a 12 percent reduction in overall cancer occurrence and said the protective effect seemed to be greater in people who had previously battled cancer.

They also saw a 12 percent reduction in the risk of death from cancer, although those findings also were not statistically significant.

Researchers said they planned to continue to follow the study group to monitor the effect of vitamin intake over time, and said additional studies would be needed to see if there were similar benefits for women or younger men.

“It doesn’t seem like there is any particular risk associated with taking a vitamin and there might be a small benefit,” said Dr. David Weinberg, chief of the department of medicine at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. He was not involved in the study.",Daily multivitamin shown to help ward off cancer in men,4,Cancer

MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A prescription medication originally developed to treat epilepsy may help obese adults shed weight when combined with routine nutritional counseling, researchers say.

Patients who took 400 milligrams of the anti-seizure drug zonisamide daily for a year lost nearly 7.5 pounds more on average than those assigned to dietaryand lifestyle changes alone, the new study found. But they also suffered more side effects than patients not taking the medication.

""The question was to see if more weight loss could be achieved if we provided decent quality lifestyle intervention, mostly dietary counseling, along with this medication,"" said study lead author Dr. Kishore Gadde, director of the Obesity Clinical Trials Program at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.

""And the answer was yes,"" Gadde said.

The research, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, appears online Oct. 15 in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.

For obese men and women who can't control their weight through diet and lifestyle changes, nonsurgical options are limited, the study authors noted. Just a few prescription medications are approved in the United States for long-term treatment of obesity, including orlistat (brand name Xenical) and lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq).

Gadde and colleagues set out to follow up on a 16-week investigation they conducted in 2003 that had indicated that zonisamide (Zonegran) at a dosage of 400 milligrams a day might offer an alternative.

Between 2006 and 2011 the study team randomly assigned more than 200 obese men and women to one of three groups. One group took 200 milligrams of zonisamide daily, another got 400 mg of zonisamide daily and one received a dummy pill. The participants' average age was 43, and their average body-mass index (BMI) was nearly 38. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese. None had diabetes.

All study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. During this time, they all also received monthly individualized nutritional counseling, which Gadde described as ""not intensive,"" to help them reduce their overall caloric intake.

Those on the higher-dose zonisamide protocol fared the best in terms of overall weight loss, while the lower-dose regimen was not much more effective than the placebo.

Although nearly 55 percent of those on the higher-dose medication shed 5 percent or more of their pre-study weight, that figure was 34 percent among the lower-dose group and 31 percent among the non-medication participants.

But patients in both drug groups faced a higher risk for side effects, including diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, concentration and memory difficulties, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms.

The authors said such side effects were typically ""mild."" They concluded that the higher-dose zonisamide showed promise as a weight-loss aid, but advised clinicians to carefully weigh the pros and cons on a patient-by-patient basis.

""There's no medicine that is a panacea for obesity,"" cautioned Gadde. ""The important thing to keep in mind is that although we diagnose obesity on the basis of a mathematical formula -- a BMI of 30 and up -- the basis for obesity may differ from one individual to another.""

Psychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. ""But for about a third [of patients], biological issues are at play, such as not easily experiencing satiety signals from the gut to the brain, which senses what your energy intake has been,"" he said. ""And for those people, medication can help.""

Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, agreed.

Caution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.

""But for many people, this kind of drug might absolutely be of great help, by doing something that helps the regulation of these appetite hormones and the regulatory pathway,"" she said.

The most common treatment for urinary incontinence is a daily dose of an anticholinergic medicine that alters the action of certain nerves. Botox injections are also used, often in cases where the medicine does not work.

Now a placebo-controlled study has found that the treatments are equally useful in reducing the frequency of episodes of incontinence, but vary in side effects and long-term effectiveness.

Researchers randomly assigned 241 women with urinary incontinence to daily medicine and a placebo injection, or a Botox injection and a daily placebo pill.

The scientists, writing online on Oct. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that both treatments significantly reduced incontinence episodes. Dry mouth was much more common in those who took the medicine; urinary infections and incomplete emptying of the bladder were more common in those given Botox. Significantly, those who took Botox were more likely to have their symptoms completely disappear.

The medicine has to be taken daily, while Botox is given in a single injection that is effective for about 6 to 12 months.

“These are both effective treatments,” said the lead author, Dr. Anthony G. Visco, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke. “This gives patients the information to make an informed decision. Both are reasonable options.”",Options in Treating Incontinence,2,New York Times

MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A large amount of beta amyloid, or ""plaques,"" in the brain may trigger more significant memory loss in healthy older people than the genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease, known as the APOE ɛ4 allele, according to new research from Australia.

""Our finding that brain-plaque-related memory decline can occur while people still have normal memory and thinking shows that these plaque-related brain changes can be detected and measured while older people are still healthy,"" said study author Yen Ying Lim, of the University of Melbourne. ""This provides an enormous opportunity for understanding the development of early Alzheimer's disease and even a sound basis for the assessment of plaque-targeting therapies.""

The researchers had nearly 150 older adults with no thinking or memory problems undergo a PET brain scan. The participants, who were an average age of 76, also were tested for the APOE gene.

The group's brain function was monitored for 18 months using computer-based tests, card games and having the participants memorize word lists.

The study results are published in the Oct. 16 issue of the journal Neurology.

Over the course of the study, the people who began with more brain plaques had up to 20 percent greater decline on the computer-based assessments of memory than the people who had fewer brain plaques.

The researchers also found the participants who carried the APOE gene had greater memory loss than those who did not have this genetic risk factor. They noted, however, that carrying the gene did not affect memory decline associated with the plaques.

""Our results show that plaques may be a more important factor in determining which people are at greater risk for cognitive impairment or other memory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,"" Lim said in a journal news release. ""Unfortunately, testing for the APOE genotype is easier and much less costly than conducting amyloid imaging.""

Although the researchers discovered an association between plaques and increased memory loss, they did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.

story_reviews_00808,"The most common sexually transmitted disease is often silent and invisible: human papillomavirus (also called HPV). But in some people HPV leads to genital warts and cancers – notably, cervical cancer.

The vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix were designed as a prevention for young women who have not yet been exposed to HPV. Men up to age 26 are also eligible for Gardasil to protect against HPV. But there are a lot of people out there who still have HPV, and nothing protects against all 130 strains of the virus. At least half of all sexually active males and females have had HPV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A Pennsylvania start-up company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals has developed an experimental vaccine for people who already have HPV and precancerous lesions that are associated with it. A new study demonstrating the vaccine's safety and potential effectiveness was published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.



The experimental vaccine does not use the live HPV virus; it is formulated in synthetic DNA and pure water. It uses the immune system of the treated women to fight off cancer, said Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals and study co-author.

Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer, with about 493,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths annually, the study said. HPV causes about 5% of cancers globally.

Some women, because of their particular genetic makeup, can clear precancerous lesions on their own and would not need this vaccine. This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said.

No one knows why some women have this capability and others do not, but for those who lack it the Inovio vaccine is ""giving our immune system a little boost,"" Kim said.

Eighteen women with high-grade precancerous cervical lesions participated in the phase 1 study.

Study authors say the vaccine is formulated to work against all cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, including cervical, anogenital (anal and genital), and head and neck cancers. The researchers did not observe any side effects.

In the next phase of this research 150 women worldwide are participating, but they are not included in these published results, Kim said.

The phase 1 results are very early in the experimentation of this vaccine. The study was not done as a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than chance. Also, 18 people is a small number for examining the effects of a medication.

Given those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. Harper contributed to the studies on both HPV vaccines that are currently available, Cervarix and Gardasil, and is not involved with this research.

“Several therapeutic vaccines have shown great promise in phase 1 and then not panned out in phase 2,” she noted in an e-mail.

The vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them.

Inovio is using this technology to develop vaccines for prostate cancer and HIV also, Kim said.

“We certainly have a technology that can change the medical field by being able to program and generate strong immune responses that are specific and effective,” he said.

Kim said the next phase results should be out at the end of 2013; then comes a larger phase 3 trial with about 500 patients, to be concluded around 2016 or 2017.

story_reviews_00810,"A study released this week by medical technology firm Covidien could lead to wider use of its tools that cut through blockages in leg arteries.

The results showed that atherectomy, the practice of trimming away the plaque that causes peripheral artery disease (PAD), is just as effective at restoring blood flow as traditional angioplasty and stents. The company says this is a major step forward in treating PAD because, unlike stents, atherectomy ""leaves no metal behind.""

A stent is a tiny metal wire mesh tube that props open an artery and is left there permanently. But in leg arteries, the active flexing can cause a stent to break. Being able to clear the blockage just as well without stents reduces possible complications and gives greater flexibility to doctors later, said Brian Verrier, vice president and general manager of peripheral vascular for Covidien.

""This particular product plays very strongly into where we see the market going,"" he said. ""The potential is huge.""

Atherectomy is only used in about 15 to 20 percent of PAD cases, but Dr. Lawrence Garcia, a principal investigator in the study, said he expects that to change with these results.

""I think it has the potential to increase business for Covidien,"" Garcia, chief of interventional cardiology and vascular interventions at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, said Thursday. He said he has no financial stake in the company.

The study is the largest to look at the effectiveness of atherectomy, Covidien said, and enrolled 800 patients at 47 centers in the U.S. and Europe. Doctors found that Covidien's SilverHawk and TurboHawk devices, which are snaked down through a small incision near the groin and basically shave away and remove the plaque, performed as well after 12 months as angioplasty and stenting.

The devices had been developed at EV3 Inc., a Plymouth med-tech company that Covidien acquired in 2010.

Thomas Gunderson, a senior analyst for Piper Jaffray & Co., said the Covidien study could lead to greater use of atherectomy and a bigger market.

""It's a good opportunity,"" Gunderson said. ""This will reawaken both the users and the nonusers to say, wait a second, now we have data.""

Also of note, Garcia said, is that the procedure proved as effective at improving blood flow for patients with diabetes as those without diabetes. It's a key finding, because patients with diabetes usually suffer from more advanced PAD and the blood vessels re-clog faster than for those who do not.

Covidien, based in Ireland, has its U.S. headquarters in Massachusetts. It also has a significant presence in the Twin Cities. In 2010, it acquired EV3, a maker of technology that treats lower extremity vascular and neurovascular diseases.

According to the American Heart Association, about 10 million people in the U.S. are affected by PAD, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, amputation and death. It occurs when arteries in the legs become narrowed or blocked by plaque. Blockages can result in severe pain, limited mobility and nonhealing leg ulcers.

A new study shows that men who had the highest levels of lycopene—an antioxidant found in tomatoes—had fewer strokes than men who had the lowest level of lycopene in their blood. Overall, the risk of strokes was reduced by 55%.

The study, based in Finland, will be published in the Oct. 9 issue of the medical journal Neurology. Lycopene is found in the highest concentrations in cooked tomato products like paste, puree and sauce, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's national nutrient database.

A cup of ready-to-serve marinara sauce has more than 31,000 micrograms of lycopene while the average raw tomato has about 3,165 micrograms, according to USDA. A slice of fast food pizza has 2,074 micrograms of lycopene. A tablespoon of catsup has 2,146 micrograms of lycopene.

Lycopene is also found in watermelon, grapefruit, papaya and mango.

There are no government recommendations specific to lycopene consumption, but U.S. dietary guidelines have traditionally recommended Americans consume at least five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day. In 2010, the U.S. updated its dietary guidelines, stating Americans should ""increase"" fruit and vegetable intake, noting that at least 2½ cups of fruits and vegetables per day was associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes. There have also been some studies that suggest lycopene can cut the risk of prostate and other types of cancer.

Dr. Rafael Ortiz, director of the Center for Stroke and Neuro-Endovascular Surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, who wasn't involved in the lycopene study, said it shows ""diet is very important"" for cutting stroke risk along with exercising and not smoking. He said lycopene reduces inflammation and prevents blood clots from forming.

The Finnish study involved 1,031 men who were part of a larger study looking at risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease.

The men were between ages 42 and 61 and living in and around the city of Kuopio in Eastern Finland when they first enrolled in the study in the early 1990s. Samples of blood were taken at the study's start and seven years later for most men. The men were followed an average of 12 years.

Jouni Karppi, the study's lead author who is affiliated with the University of Eastern Finland's Department of Medicine, said that the main goal of the study was to look at whether other substances such as retinol, or vitamin A, and alpha-tocopherol, a type of vitamin E, impacted stroke rates.

They found no association with the levels of vitamin A or E, but instead found men who had the highest level of lycopene in their bodies were 55% less likely to have a stroke than men with the lowest amount of lyocopene. They were 59% less likely to have a type of stroke called an ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke that is caused by a blood clot.

Overall, there were 67 strokes among the 1,031 men in the study. Of those, 50 were ischemic. There were 25 strokes among 258 men who were considered to have the lowest levels of lycopene while there were 11 strokes among men with the highest lycopene levels. The men were divided into four groups by lycopene levels.

The study was funded by Lapland Central Hospital in Finland.

story_reviews_00812,"Eating tomatoes in your daily salad or regularly enjoying a healthy red sauce on your spaghetti could help reduce your risk of stroke, according to research published this week in the journal Neurology.

Tomatoes contain a powerful antioxidant that is good for brain health, the researchers say, and cooked tomatoes seem to offer more protection than raw.

""This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,"" says study author Jouni Karppi, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. ""A diet containing tomatoes... a few times a week would be good for our health. However, daily intake of tomatoes may give better protection.""



Karppi says it's the chemical lycopene that gives tomatoes and other fruits/vegetables their rich red color, that is helping to protect the brain. Tomatoes are particularly high in the powerful antioxidant that acts like a sponge, soaking up rogue molecules called free radicals that if left unchecked can damage cells.

The study

Researchers tested the level of lycopene in the blood of more than 1,000 Finnish men aged 46 to 65, starting in 1991. Scientists then followed the men on average for more than a decade to record the number who had strokes.

The scientists found that those with the highest levels of lycopene were 55% less likely to have a stroke than those with the lowest amounts in their blood.

Caveats

Though the study looks promising, experts say that we can't necessarily give all of the credit to lycopene.

""It's a compelling study and it fits with other data that we have about risk of stroke and vegetable and fruit consumption,"" explains Dr. Daniel Labovitz, director of the Stern Stroke Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. ""But it's not proof that if you eat tomatoes you're going to have less risk of stroke.""

Labovitz also points out that the group of men who had fewer strokes were younger, had lower blood pressure and smoked less than the group more prone to stroke. Though the researchers tried to take these lifestyle factors into account when calculating their findings, it may be that these things influenced the outcomes.

In other words, perhaps better health habits - not necessarily just the lycopene - lead to fewer strokes.

More on lycopene

Lycopene has attracted a lot of attention in recent years because it's such a powerful antioxidant. If we don't eat enough lycopene-packed foods, experts suspect too many free radicals get left in the body, damaging blood vessels by helping to form fatty deposits. When these deposits build up, a blockage forms. If that vessel is in the brain, the blockage can cause a stroke.

But the foods we eat are complex and filled with many nutrients, making it tough to prove what is really providing benefits.

""Eating tomatoes is a good thing, but we don't know if there is really anything unique about tomatoes apart from other fruits and vegetables that reduce stroke risk,"" explains Dr. Walter Willett, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts.

Tomatoes could contribute to reducing stroke in other ways, Willett says, because they are a good source of potassium, which is known to reduce blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is major risk factor for stroke.

Take home message

So are lycopene packed tomatoes really the magic fruit? It seems the jury is still out, but researchers suggest we eat healthy as they continue to search for answers.

""This is one more reason to consume fruits and vegetables - at least 5 a day - and it's good to include tomatoes in that mix,"" Willett said.",Tomatoes may help reduce stroke risk,4,CNN
story_reviews_00813,"Oct. 8, 2012 -- Men who eat lots of tomatoes and tomato-based products may have a lower risk for stroke, a new study suggests.

Tomatoes are rich in the antioxidant lycopene.

Men who had the highest levels of lycopene in their blood were 55% less likely to have a stroke, compared with men who had the lowest levels of the antioxidant in their blood.

The lowered risk was even greater for strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, called ischemic strokes. These are the most common type of stroke. Men who had the highest lycopene levels were 59% less likely to have this kind of stroke than men with the lowest levels. The findings appear in the Oct. 9, 2012, issue of Neurology.

The new study included slightly more than 1,000 men from Finland aged 46 to 65. Researchers measured the level of lycopene in their blood when the study began and followed the men for about 12 years. During that time, 67 men had a stroke.

“This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,” says researcher Jouni Karppi, PhD, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. “The results support the recommendation that people get more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, which would likely lead to a major reduction in the number of strokes worldwide, according to previous research.”

The benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer’s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine.

Called solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The drug is designed to prevent those clumps from forming.

Oct. 8, 2012 (Boston) -- An experimental Alzheimer ’s treatment slowed memory loss by about one-third in people with mild Alzheimer's , offering hope that the drug can alter the course of the progressive disease.

'Encouraging' Results

Maria Carrillo, PhD, a neuroscientist and vice president for medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer’s Association, calls the results ""encouraging"" and says she hopes development will continue.

""While [beta-amyloid] is the leading hypothesis of what causes the disease, that has remained unproven. This study may not have hit on everything, and it is not the home run we wanted, but it is the first time we’ve seen cognitive benefit with an amyloid treatment,"" she says.

The latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

When the findings of the two studies were looked at individually, patients given solanezumab for 18 months didn’t do better on either a test used to measure patients' symptoms or a measure of how well patients are functioning than patients given a placebo.

Combining the two studies to give them more statistical power showed that patients on solanezumab didn’t lose their memories as quickly as those on placebo.

The results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease. In the analysis, those given solanezumab had a 34% reduction in memory loss and other mental symptoms compared with those on placebo. There was even a hint that the drug helped to slow the decline in functioning.

Asked if the 34% improvement in cognitive decline is meaningful to a patient, Carrillo said, ""I have a family member with AD. I would be happy with a sustained cognitive benefit for my mother-in-law.""

Duchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.

While steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.

The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.

One possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.

While the company excluded those boys from its analysis as outliers, the Food and Drug Administration might not do so. That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.

“If you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,” Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.

Patient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.

Ten-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. “He’s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,” she said.

But Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max’s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.

Mr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. “That would be the quickest path to insolvency,” he said.

If eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.

Eteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin. By skipping over this exon, muscle cells can produce an imperfect form of dystrophin that nonetheless is at least partly functional.",Drug Shows Promise in Treating a Type of Muscular Dystrophy in Boys,4,Alzheimer's
story_reviews_00818,"-- A new study may reassure some women considering short-term use of hormones to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Starting low-dose treatment early in menopause made women feel better and did not seem to raise heart risks during the four-year study.

However, the research didn't address the risk of breast cancer, perhaps the biggest fear women have about hormones since a landmark study a decade ago. The new one was too small and too short for that.

Still, it is the first fresh research in many years on the sometimes confusing effects of hormones on women's health. The advice remains the same: Use hormones only for severe symptoms – not to prevent bone loss or aging-related problems – at the lowest dose for the shortest time possible.

""The benefits outweigh the risks when hormone therapy is used for symptom management with relatively short-term treatment,"" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, preventive medicine chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was a study leader and will discuss results Wednesday at a conference of the North American Menopause Society in Orlando, Fla.

For decades, doctors believed hormone pills helped prevent heart problems and were good for bones and minds. That changed in 2002, when a big federal study was stopped because women taking estrogen-progestin pills had higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Critics pounced on the study's limitations. Participants were well past menopause – 63 on average – and most were not seeking symptom relief. Many were overweight and smokers, and at higher risk of heart disease to start with. Only one type of pill in one dose was tested.

Women who could take estrogen alone – those who had had hysterectomies – did not have the risks that women on the combination hormone pills did. In fact, they had lower rates of breast cancer.

These factors led many experts to think some hormones might help certain women, and that the type and dose might matter. The new study tested that.

It enrolled about 700 healthy women ages 42 to 58 within three years of menopause. They were given either low-dose estrogen pills (Premarin, made by Wyeth, now part of Pfizer Inc.), a low-dose estrogen skin patch (Climara, made by Bayer), or a placebo. Women on estrogen also received Prometrium, a progesterone that more closely mimics what the body makes.

All women received a patch and two types of pills, but some of those were fake treatments and neither they nor their doctors knew who had the real medicine versus placebos until the study ended. That is standard study design to test who is really helped by a medication.

The main goal was seeing whether hormones made a difference in hardening of the arteries, a precursor to heart disease, as seen on imaging tests. Other health measures also were tracked. After four years, doctors found:

_No effect on blood pressure or artery hardening.

_Both types of estrogen reduced hot flashes and improved bone density, mood and sexual health.

_Estrogen pills raised good cholesterol and lowered the bad form, but also caused triglycerides (another type of fat in the bloodstream) to rise.

_Estrogen patches did not affect cholesterol but improved blood-sugar levels and insulin sensitivity, possibly making them a better choice for overweight women at risk of diabetes.

Patches and pills have different effects, said Dr. S. Mitchell Harman, an endocrinologist and director of the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a Phoenix-based group with no industry ties that paid for the study. Oral estrogen goes straight to the liver, resulting in higher concentrations than when it's absorbed through the skin. That raises blood-clotting factors that might be especially harmful to smokers. But higher estrogen levels also cause the liver to make more HDL, or good cholesterol. So estrogen can have good and bad effects depending on the form, he said.

Skin patches account for just 2 percent of hormone use, some studies estimate. Besides Climara, at least one other is on the market – Vivelle-Dot, sold by Novartis and Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. A generic version is expected in about a year.

Dr. Sanjay Asthana, a geriatrician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, led a separate analysis that found estrogen pills and patches improved depression and anxiety but had no effect on cognition or memory. The National Institute on Aging paid for that study.

Women need to realize the new study is much less definitive than the big federal one that found more lung and breast cancer deaths among women on estrogen-progestin pills, said one researcher involved in the earlier work, Dr. Rowan Chlebowski of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. It would be unwise to try to prevent certain health problems by using a treatment ""that increased the two leading causes of cancer deaths in women,"" he said.

Manson agreed that hormones should be used only for severe symptoms. Two study participants found they helped.

""My mood leveled out. I found that I was just generally calmer"" on the estrogen patch, said Kathy Smerko, 60, a nurse practitioner from Phoenix.

Dianne Fraser, 56, an accountant from suburban Boston, said the patch eliminated the drenching sweats that woke her in the night. She was able to quit treatment after five years and seldom has problems now.

""It was enough to get me through that crazy period"" right after menopause began, she said.

story_reviews_00819,"A widely anticipated study suggests that hormone therapy started soon after menopause can ease depression, anxiety, hot flashes and other adverse symptoms that many women face, without increasing risks for cardiovascular disease.

There was no increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, but the study's researchers said the sample size was too small and the study time too short to draw firm conclusions.

The preliminary findings, presented Wednesday at a conference of the North American Menopause Society in Orlando, Fla., were in starkcontrast to those of the Women's Health Initiative. That much larger, government-funded study of hormone therapy was halted in 2002 because the risks of heart disease and stroke seemed to outweigh the benefits.

Those findings had sparked concern among women who turn to hormone therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The women in the WHI were older—on average 63 years old—and largely a decade or more past menopause, and critics suggested women closer to menopause might get more benefit with less harm. Nevertheless, use of estrogen and progesterone in the U.S. dropped by more than half between 2001 and 2009, according to IMS Health, a health-care technology and information company.

The new study ""will be reassuring to many people who were anxious about using estrogen for short-term therapy, particularly health-care providers who were nervous about their patients taking this,"" said Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine, one of the study's eight sites.

The trial, known as Keeps, for Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, was funded by the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Phoenix that conducts research on age-related diseases.

The four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 727 women aged 42 to 58 who were within three years of the onset of menopause. They received either a low-dose estrogen pill (one made with horse estrogen) or a skin patch (one with estradiol, made from plants but closer to what women's bodies make) or a placebo.

Women on estrogen also took a natural progesterone; the WHI used a synthetic form.

Neither type of estrogen had any significant impact on blood pressure, coronary calcium levels or atherosclerosis, as measured by ultrasounds of the carotid artery—key markers of cardiovascular health. Researchers speculated that was because the women were generally healthy and yet at an age where such problems are rare.

Women taking estrogen in pill form had an increase in HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, and a decrease in LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, but an increase in triglycerides. Women on the patch had an improvement in insulin sensitivity, making them less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.

Women on both forms of estrogen reported fewer hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings, as well as an improvement in bone density.

A second branch of the study, funded by the National Institute of Aging, found that estrogen in pill form, but not the patch, improved symptoms of depression, anxiety and tension, without causing memory or cognitive ability, which the WHI had found in older women.

Researchers said those findings underscored the need for women and their doctors to make individual decisions about whether to go on hormone therapy and if so, which kind.

""A woman who has low HDL cholesterol and borderline high LDL and has some mood symptoms, might find some advantages on the oral estrogen, whereas a woman who has [high risk for Type 2 diabetes], some excess weight, might benefit from the [skin patch] form,"" said JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the lead Keeps researchers. The researchers , who haven't yet submitted the findings for publication, plan more analysis on the impact of hormone therapy on breast density They also say they hope to continue monitoring the participants for any future effects on heart disease, cancer or cognitive function-whether they continue to take hormones or not.

Margery Gass, executive director of the menopause society, and who wasn't involved in Keeps, said it confirmed her group's view on hormone therapy: ""There seems to be very small risks for healthy women at menopause."" But, ""there is no strong evidence that women should be taking it long-term.""

story_reviews_00820,"A new, detailed mammography exam catches more cancers while causing fewer false alarms, according to the company that sells it. The downside, some physicians say, is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms.

Tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February from Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass. In just a few months, radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam.

Others, though, urge caution. ""We really have to wait for the scientific evidence,"" says Barbara Monsees, who heads the American College of Radiology's breast-imaging commission, adding that the technology looks ""promising.""

Many digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a 3-D image. Standard mammograms miss 5% to 15% of tumors, in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue. We discuss with Robert Cascella, CEO of Hologic, which manufactures a 3-D mammography machine. Photo: Hologic.

A study of some 25,000 women, now under way by an international team of researchers and partially funded by Hologic, is examining whether 3-D mammography finds more cancers. Preliminary results, presented at a scientific meeting in November, showed a 47% increase in cancer detection, but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Dr. Monsees.

The American Cancer Society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at 40 years old. A 3-D mammography machine is similar those used for standard 2-D mammography, but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast, the X-ray arm of a 3-D machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create 50 or 60 razor-thin slices for each view. The 3-D scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths.

Radiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue. ""I think we're going to find more cancers at an earlier stage"" says Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., adding that one recent tumor, difficult to see on a standard exam, ""jumped right out at us"" on a 3-D scan.

The benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts, in which tumors can be hard to see, but the 3-D exam produces better results in all women, she says.

The new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women ""more options,"" such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose, says Laurie Margolies, director of Breast Imaging at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Dr. Margolies has briefly consulted for Hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company.

In addition to finding more tumors, early experience shows the 3-D exam may reduce anxiety-producing ""recalls,"" in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work-up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning; recalls are mostly false alarms. In a 7,529-woman study at Yale University, the recall rate of women screened with 3-D and 2-D mammography combined was 6.6%, compared with 11.1% for 2-D alone.

The full exam typically includes a standard 2-D view as well as a 3-D one and has a patient under compression for a total of about 48 seconds, compared with 20 for a standard exam, Hologic says. Insurance often doesn't cover the 3-D portion so doctors say you often need to pay about $50 out of pocket. (The 2-D exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans, Hologic says.)

The combination exam delivers 8.8 milligray of radiation per exam, around double what is given during a standard exam on Hologic 2-D machines, the company says. The double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in 1 in 1,000 women who get 3-D mammography annually from age 40 until 80 instead of the standard exam, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The more-detailed exam will save lives overall over the 2-D scan if at least 3% more cancers are detected, which appears likely from preliminary data, says Peter Soltani, senior vice president of breast health at Hologic. He adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer.

Hologic has applied to the FDA for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a 2-D image from detail taken in the 3-D sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you'd only have to take one set of images instead of two. General Electric Co. is also applying to the FDA for permission to market a 3-D mammography machine; the company declined to say when it expects a decision.

story_reviews_00821,"MONDAY, Oct. 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new anti-clotting drug called apixaban was better than warfarin at preventing stroke in patients with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation, a new study found.

Data from more than 18,000 patients also found that apixaban was safer overall than warfarin, and tended to cause less bleeding in the skull in patients who faced the highest risk of bleeding.

The findings suggest that the current risk scoring systems for tailoring anti-clotting (anticoagulant) treatment to individual patients may be less relevant when using apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for stroke, according to the Duke University Medical Center researchers.

""The benefits of apixaban are preserved, regardless of the risk score used and regardless of the patient risk category,"" study author and cardiologist Dr. Renato Lopes said in a Duke news release. ""With new oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, we might not need risk scores to guide treatment decisions for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. This may simplify how physicians make decisions and also improve patient care.""

Study co-investigator Dr. Jack Ansell agreed.

""This analysis provides further support for the benefit of apixaban, but given the very low risk of bleeding with apixaban, it also suggests that the current stroke and bleeding risk scores may not be sensitive enough to tease out those patients with the very lowest risk of stroke who might benefit from apixaban therapy,"" said Ansell, who is chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and a consultant to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the companies that are marketing the drug as Eliquis. The drug has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The study was published online Oct. 1 in The Lancet.

Apixaban showed a 21 percent relative reduction in the incidence of strokes or systemic embolisms (clots) when compared to warfarin, a 31 percent relative reduction in major bleeding and an 11 percent relative reduction in overall mortality, the researchers found.

Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2.6 million people in the United States. In people with atrial fibrillation, disorganized electrical activity causes ineffective contraction of the upper chambers of the heart. This increases the risk for blood clots that can cause stroke.

Current practice guidelines permit the use of either anti-clotting therapy with aspirin or warfarin. Aspirin is less effective than warfarin, but carries a lower risk of bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor for stroke.

story_reviews_00822,"SATURDAY, Sept. 29, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers say they've discovered a two-drug combination that delays treatment resistance in patients with advanced melanoma.

By targeting different points in the same growth-factor pathway, the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma, the study authors said.

Melanoma is the most serious, and often deadly, form of skin cancer. In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.

Previous research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.

""We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,"" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.

The phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.

""We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,"" he said.

One expert agreed that the results were encouraging.

""This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,"" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

The study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.

Patients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.

Treatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.

Among patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.

The study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.

story_reviews_00823,"For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the decision about how to treat it -- or even whether to treat it -- can be agonizing. Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can’t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.

So what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?

New research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man’s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.

“More often than not, it’s not clear-cut which way to go,” explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. “If you see a surgeon, he’s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he’ll say oncology.”

Determining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.

The researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.

The scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the “spelling” of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.

It turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.

“It is cumulative,” Rosenstein explained. “If a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.”

The research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren’t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. “This is still not nearly good enough, yet” he said.

But he’s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.

If they can, then doctors really will be “able to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,” he said. “And if we can do that, then there’ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.”

Even better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.

That hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.

""This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,"" Derweesh said.

While Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the ""holy grail"" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.

This kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein’s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it’s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, Sept. 11, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new device meant to help surgeons determine in the operating room if they have removed all cancerous breast cancer tissue may help reduce repeat surgeries after lumpectomy without compromising cosmetic effects, according to a new study.

The device, called MarginProbe, emits an electric field and senses a return signal from the tissue examined. Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.

""This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,"" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.

The study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.

""The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,"" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.

""Everything still goes through pathology,"" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.

Boolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.

In June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.

For the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.

Where the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.

Typically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.

""We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,"" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.

Among women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.

Looking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.

Dr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women's Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising. However, she thinks more research is needed.

""I would like to see it [used] in a larger population,"" she said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said.

The expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said. This is much less than the cost of re-operation, he noted.

The device is also being studied for use with prostate cancer, the company said.

Data and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

story_reviews_00825,"CHICAGO -- Acupuncture gets a thumbs-up for helping relieve pain from chronic headaches, backaches and arthritis in a review of more than two dozen studies -- the latest analysis of an often-studied therapy that has as many fans as critics.

Some believe its only powers are a psychological, placebo effect. But some doctors believe even if that's the explanation for acupuncture's effectiveness, there's no reason not to offer it if it makes people feel better.

The new analysis examined 29 studies involving almost 18,000 adults. The researchers concluded that the needle remedy worked better than usual pain treatment and slightly better than fake acupuncture. That kind of analysis is not the strongest type of research, but the authors took extra steps including examining raw data from the original studies.

The results ""provide the most robust evidence to date that acupuncture is a reasonable referral option,"" wrote the authors, who include researchers with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and several universities in England and Germany.

Their study isn't proof, but it adds to evidence that acupuncture may benefit a range of conditions.

The new analysis was published online Monday in Archives of Internal Medicine. The federal government's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine paid for most of the study, along with a small grant from the Samueli Institute, a non-profit group that supports research on alternative healing.

Acupuncture's use has become more mainstream. The military has used it to help treat pain from war wounds, and California recently passed legislation that would include acupuncture among treatments recommended for coverage under provisions of the nation's new health care law. That law requires insurance plans to cover certain categories of benefits starting in 2014. Deciding specifics is being left up to the states.

Some private insurance plans already cover acupuncture; Medicare does not.

In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture involves inserting long, very thin needles just beneath the skin's surface at specific points on the body to control pain or stress. Several weekly sessions are usually involved, typically costing about $60 to $100 per session. Fake acupuncture studied in research sometimes also uses needles, but on different areas of the body.

Scientists aren't sure what biological mechanism could explain how acupuncture might relieve pain, but the authors of the new study say the results suggest there's more involved than just a placebo effect.

Acupuncture skeptic Dr. Stephen Barrett said the study results are dubious. The retired psychiatrist runs Quackwatch, a Web site on medical scams, and says studies of acupuncture often involve strict research conditions that don't mirror how the procedure is used in the real world.

The new analysis combined results from studies of patients with common types of chronic pain -- recurring headaches, arthritis or back, neck and shoulder. The studies had randomly assigned patients to acupuncture and either fake acupuncture or standard pain treatment including medication or physical therapy.

The authors explained their statistical findings by using a pain scale of 0 to 100: The patients' average baseline pain measured 60; it dropped to 30 on average in those who got acupuncture, 35 in those who got fake acupuncture, and 43 in the usual treatment group.

While the difference in results for real versus fake acupuncture was small, it suggests acupuncture could have more than a psychological effect, said lead author Andrew Vickers, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The center offers acupuncture and other alternative therapies for cancer patients with hard-to-treat pain.

The analysis was more rigorous than most research based on pooling previous studies' results, because the authors obtained original data from each study. That makes the conclusion more robust, said Dr. Andrew Avins, author of an Archives commentary and a physician and researcher with the University of California at San Francisco and Kaiser-Permanente.

Acupuncture is relatively safe and uncertainty over how it works shouldn't stop doctors from offering it as an option for patients struggling with pain, Avins said.

""Perhaps a more productive strategy at this point would be to provide whatever benefits we can for our patients, while we continue to explore more carefully all mechanisms of healing,"" he wrote.","Study: Placebo or not, acupuncture helps with pain",5,Associated Press
story_reviews_00826,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder pain, according to a new review of the evidence - but some of its benefit is likely due to the “placebo effect,” researchers concluded.

In an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn’t.

But patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure.

“A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

“This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,” he told Reuters Health.

Acupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.

Some think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them.

That either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said.

To try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis.

The researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a “modest” improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients.

They estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.

A typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance.

USUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP

“I have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,” said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.

It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain.

Park, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would.

“I am a biased clinician,” Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”

Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.

For two decades, Patricia DiGiusto struggled with severe asthma. Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.

On one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.

“I’ll never forget that feeling,” said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. “The feeling that I’m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.”

Two years ago, Ms. DiGiusto’s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.

During the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient’s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit — cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.

Ms. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. “I’m a language therapist,” she said, “but I can’t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.”

Across the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.

Avoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone — which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects — become a necessity.

Nationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.

Doctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.

“For those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it’s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we’ve seen it work, and the data says it works,” said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. “But the big insurers have all denied it.”

Although bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.

It takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.

But several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.

“This isn’t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,” said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. “It’s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.” For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who — unlike a vast majority of asthma patients — cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.

“There are millions and millions of asthmatics,” he said. “There will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.”

Still, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.

Until then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. “The issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,” she said.

But three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.

One such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.

“Every two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,” he said, “and I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.”

Blue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.

“Now I can breathe,” he said, “and I’m saving my insurance company a fortune.”

Dr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.

“When plans look at the cost savings, I think they’re going to cover it,” said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “You have to show that there’s a return on investment.”","Relief for Severe Asthma, at a High Price",3,New York Times
story_reviews_00828,"CINCINNATI – Dawne Gardner-Davis almost skipped the free health screening for her son. The weather was rotten, an earlier appointment ran long — and 15-year-old Jordan was the picture of health.

Today, the Cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didn't. Doctors diagnosed Jordan with aortic root dilation, a potentially life-threatening heart defect. They advised the teen — who played six sports, his favorite being baseball — to quit competitive athletics for good.

For decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love.

Now, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. In the most complete test of its kind, the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart.

If proved effective, it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10,000 people at risk when doing top-level physical activities, researchers say.

Since the study began about a year ago, 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Twenty-two can continue in athletics, though they'll require lifelong monitoring.

Four young athletes, two girls and two boys, have been advised to quit sports altogether. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they're done.

So far, their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected.

Jordan was one of the more serious cases.

That day at his appointment, he, his mother and little sister Jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in Jordan's heart. Because of its size, it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity. The effects could kill him.

Jordan took his doctor's advice and quit the sports he loved.

""The saddest day for me had to be the day of (baseball) try-outs,"" Jordan says. ""I woke up, and I couldn't go to try-outs. After that I just started to cope.""

Precise diagnoses sought

Cases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects, says Dr. Jeffrey Towbin, co-director and head of clinical care at the Heart Institute. Victims often show no earlier symptoms, looking the picture of health.

Towbin asked two pediatric cardiologists — Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier —to take on the study that he'd wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago.

""One of our goals is to advance the field … in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important,"" Towbin says. ""These cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year.""

As high school sports begin this year, the caution takes on increased urgency.

Locally, swimmer Jose Cerda Navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in October 2010. He died within the hour at the hospital, on this 18th birthday.

Cameron Batson, 18, died a few weeks before that, while playing a game of pick-up soccer. He had graduated that spring from high school in Covington.

In the United States, a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league. Approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags.

Some years ago, Italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram, a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.

Fewer Italian athletes died after the testing began, but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes.

""There's got to be a better way,"" Anderson said. ""That's what we set out to answer.""

Anderson and Grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram — a two-dimensional image of the heart — can offer a more precise diagnosis.

National estimates are that roughly 1% of people are born with potentially life-threatening heart defects. But the Children's Hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well, perhaps because of better technology, Grenier says.

""I do think they're real numbers,"" she says of the study's findings so far. ""Are they normal variations? What (abnormality) is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny? That's not entirely known.""

Grenier and her colleagues at the Heart Institute hope to continue this study — turn it into an ongoing program — so they may one day be able to answer those questions. In the meantime, screenings continue.

Making tests affordable, accessible

A key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won't cover them. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says.

Simon's Fund, a non-profit organization, donated $5,000 to honor Cerda Navarro for screenings. Children's Hospital paid the rest, around $42,000, according to Children's spokesman Jim Feuer.

If an ongoing program of testing happens, the hospital would try to tap into third-party funding, donations and grants, Towbin says. ""The hope would be that with data, we could get the entire system interested in participating … get funding to run a clinical trial, locally and maybe nationally.""

After Jordan's diagnosis, his family packed the room to support him for every subsequent appointment.

He now takes daily blood pressure medication and is allowed to jog and do other light physical activities.

""He grew up around athletics, so I'm sure it was a culture shock for him,"" says his grandfather, Lacey Calloway. ""Whatever he does, he knows we've got his back, even if it's tiddlywinks.""

Sports teaches discipline, Gardner-Davis says, but her son is finding that in other interests. Jordan plays the drums in a high school concert band, is getting into photography and cars — now that he's 16. And he got a summer job at Great American Ballpark.

Gardner-Davis calls the decision to take him for that screening the ""best decision of my life"" and suggests other parents take advantage of the free service.

""We're so thankful,"" she says. ""Otherwise, we'd have no idea, and Jordan could be standing here one day and gone the next.""",Heart study helps save lives of young athletes,2,heart disease

The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday announced its first major shift on circumcision in more than a decade, concluding that the health benefits of the procedure clearly outweigh any risks.

""There is clear evidence that supports the health benefits of circumcision,"" said Susan Blank, who led the 14-member task force that formulated the new policy being published in the journal Pediatrics.

The statement, and accompanying technical report, marks the first revision of the organization's position since 1999, when the academy backed away from circumcision. At that time, the group, which represents about 60,000 pediatricians nationwide, concluded that there was no clear evidence for or against circumcising newborns. The group affirmed that position in 2005.

Since then, the popularity of circumcision in the United States has declined. Only about 56 percent of newborn males are circumcised.

The academy's task force spent seven years combing through the latest research, analyzing more than a thousand studies. Their conclusion?

For starters, Blank says, circumcision helps baby boys pretty much immediately.

""The health benefits of male circumcision include a drop in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life by up to 90 percent,"" she says.

But there's a much bigger reason to do it, Blank said. Circumcised males are far less likely to get infected with a long list of sexually transmitted diseases.

""It drops the risk of heterosexual HIV acquisition by about 60 percent. It drops the risk of human papillomavirus [HPV], herpes virus and other infectious genital ulcers,"" she says.

It also reduces the chances that men will spread HPV to their wives and girlfriends, protecting them from getting cervical cancer.

""We've reviewed the data and, you know, we have gone through them with a fine-tooth comb, and the data are pretty convincing,"" she says.

Critics, however, were not convinced. They liken the procedure to female genital mutilation.

""We have no right as parents or as physicians or adults to strap them down and chop off a normal part of their body. To do that is a human rights violation and an ethical travesty,"" says Georgeanne Chapin of the anti-circumcision group Intact America.

Chapin and other critics argue that the scientific evidence is questionable. For one thing, the studies about HIV have only been done in Africa, where AIDS is much more common among heterosexuals.

""They're cherry-picking their evidence,"" she says. ""They act as though there's this huge body of literature. It's all the same couple of studies that have been regurgitated and reprogrammed. Over the past 150 years, all kinds of medical benefits have been proposed as resulting from cutting off the foreskin, and they have all been disproven.""

Critics also question the safety of the procedure, saying too many boys are damaged for life by botched circumcisions.

But many experts say the academy is making the right call. They dismiss any comparison to female genital mutilation as grossly misleading and say male circumcision is about as safe as any procedure could be.

Some think the academy's position is long overdue, and that the group should have gone even further and more forcefully recommended circumcision.

""I think that all healthy newborn babies should be circumcised,"" says Edgar Schoen, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco. ""I feel about newborn circumcision the way I do about immunization: It's a potent preventive health procedure that gives you a health advantage.""

For its part, the pediatricians group hopes the new recommendations will encourage more parents to circumcise their sons — and more insurance plans to pay for it. As Shots reported last week, a lot of state Medicaid programs have stopped covering circumcision.

""Those families who choose circumcision should have access to circumcision. Cost should not be a barrier,"" Blank says.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been promising for years now to issue the government's first guidelines about circumcision. But the CDC keeps delaying it and still has not said when that will happen.",Pediatricians Decide Boys Are Better Off Circumcised Than Not,4,NPR
story_reviews_00831,"Aug. 15, 2012 -- If you aspire to fatherhood, it might not hurt to go a little nuts. Walnuts, that is.

Eating 2.5 ounces of walnuts a day -- a little more than half a cup -- for 12 weeks improved sperm quality in healthy young men, researchers report. Their study is part of a growing body of evidence that men’s dietary and lifestyle choices might affect their fertility.

The new study, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, enrolled 117 men aged 21 to 35 who ate a typical Western diet.

Half the men were randomly assigned to eat 2.5 ounces of walnuts a day, along with their usual diet. The other men were told to continue their regular diet but not to eat any tree nuts.

Walnuts are the only nuts with appreciable levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which some studies of male infertility have linked to better sperm quality, says researcher Wendie Robbins, PhD, of the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. Animal and human studies have shown that omega-3 fats and other polyunsaturated fatty acids “play critical roles in sperm maturation and membrane function,” Robbins’ team writes.

Previous research has shown that men with poor sperm counts saw improvement after taking fish oil supplements high in omega-3 fats, Robbins says. And a study of men attending a fertility clinic, published in May by the journal Human Reproduction, found that high intake of omega-3 fats was linked to more normal sperm size and shape, while high intake of saturated fats was related to lower sperm concentration.

In the new study, most of the walnut eaters snacked on the shelled whole nuts straight out of the package, Robbins says. Others mixed them with applesauce and cinnamon in a blender or chopped them up and added them to meatloaf, hamburger, and spaghetti sauce.

Before and after the experiment, the men’s semen quality was analyzed by a researcher who did not know which ones had eaten walnuts.

story_reviews_00832,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study bolsters the case that daily aspirin may help protect against cancer, although the effect seems weaker than previously thought.

An aerial view shows an administration building of the German Bayer AG chemical company in Leverkusen wrapped as giant ""Aspirin"" box.

And the final chapter on the popular but controversial drug has yet to be written, experts say, because like earlier research the new work has considerable limitations.

“News about the cancer potential of aspirin use has been really encouraging lately,” said Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society, who worked on the study. “Things are moving forward, but it is still a work in progress.”

Medical guidelines in the U.S. already urge people to take low doses of aspirin to prevent heart disease if the predicted benefits outweigh the risk of side effects, or if they have already suffered a heart attack.

Whether those recommendations should be broadened to include cancer prevention is still up in the air, however.

Earlier this year, an analysis of previous clinical trials showed that people on aspirin were less likely to die of cancer than those not on the medication, with a 37-percent drop in cancer deaths observed from five years onwards.

The new report, published Friday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is based on real-life observations instead of experiments. It includes a decade’s worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers.

People who said they took daily aspirin - whether ‘baby’ or adult strength - had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found.

For men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42.

The effect was strongest for gastrointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer and stomach cancer. But it didn’t seem to matter whether people had been on aspirin for more or less than five years.

Because the study wasn’t a clinical trial, it’s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play.

Still, Thun said the results would favor broadening the aspirin guidelines to include cancer prevention based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. But he added that it will take scientists a few years to mull over all of the existing evidence.

LONG-STANDING CONTROVERSY

Other researchers are more skeptical. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George’s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds.

“This is not a drug without side effects, so what you have to look at is net benefit,” he told Reuters Health.

Earlier this year, Ray’s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good.

One of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. People who develop stomach bleeding from aspirin are likely to get their bowels checked out by a doctor. As a result, doctors may find and remove tumors or precancerous polyps, which could prolong the patient’s life - the idea behind colon cancer screening.

So far, most aspirin trials have been designed to test the drug’s effect on heart disease. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.

“I don’t think we have enough hard evidence suggesting everybody should be taking” aspirin, Ray said.

When it comes to cancer, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees. It discourages the use of aspirin to stave off colorectal cancer in people at average risk for the disease.

story_reviews_00833,"Aug. 12, 2012 -- Daily aspirin use, long recommended for people at high risk of heart attack, may also reduce the risk of dying from cancer, according to new research.

The benefit, however, may not be as great as believed, says researcher Eric Jacobs, PhD, of the American Cancer Society.

A previous study by others found daily aspirin reduced cancer death risk by 37%. ""In our analysis, daily aspirin use was associated with about a 16% lower risk of dying from cancer overall,"" Jacobs says.

He describes that reduction as modest.

Even so, he says, ""our results provide additional support for the potential benefit of daily aspirin for [reducing] cancer mortality.""

He found an association, not cause and effect.

Many other strategies will also reduce the risk of cancer, he says. Among them: engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking cigarettes.

• Read part two: ALS strikes at random, killing young and old

• Graphic: What is ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)?

Sometimes she glares at the painting of Jesus in her dining room.

""I just let it loose,"" said Mary Kleiss at her Royal Oak home. ""I look at that picture and I say, 'You get down here and put on your boxing gloves and let's get this over with.' I am so damned angry.""

Her son, Regis, was diagnosed two and a half years ago with Lou Gehrig's disease -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. It is, he writes, ""as if God is torturing me.""

The disease kills with stunning efficiency -- deadening its victims' peripheral nerves, withering muscles and, in a final assault, shutting down their ability to breathe. An estimated 30,000 people have it at any given time; 5,000 are diagnosed yearly. Most die within years. There is no cure.

The disease has reduced Regis Kleiss, 28, a formerly thick-bodied shot and discus thrower and captain of the track team at Dondero High School, to a bony echo of himself. Paralyzed except for some minor movement of his head, he will spend his final days on a feeding tube.

ALS leaves its victims' minds intact.

""It's a miserable, damned disease,"" his mother said.

Now, a clinical trial overseen by the University of Michigan may provide hope. It is cutting-edge and audacious work -- the only ALS trial so far in which neural stem cells are injected directly into a patient's spinal cord. So far, 15 patients have undergone the procedure -- two of them twice -- as the FDA monitors its safety.

One patient showed a remarkable improvement for a while, though U-M's Dr. Eva Feldman, who heads the research, cautions not to read too much into that. The other 14 showed no improvement.

The trail is tentative and early. But when the rest of a person's life has been compressed to an expectancy of two to five years, it is hope nonetheless.

The trial has been based in Atlanta since 2010, but U-M has requested approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand it and move it to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

The trial involves injecting 500,000-1 million stem cells into the spine. The ancestry of the cells dates to the spinal cord of an aborted fetus in 2000. The cells are different from the embryonic stem cells that were the subject of a controversial ballot proposal in Michigan in 2008, when voters approved lifting the ban on embryonic stem cell research.

Feldman and others theorize that these new cells act as nursemaids to damaged nerve cells, sending out repair signals, and somehow halting the progression of the disease.

The procedure worked in rats. It has been shown to be safe in pigs.

If the FDA approves moving the trial to Ann Arbor, Michigan patients will have access to an experimental treatment that not only might offer insight into a disease that kills an estimated 15 Americans a day, but also push back the battle lines against other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's or Huntington's.

""There is a lot of potential here,"" said Sue Burstein-Kahn, executive director of ALS of Michigan, a Southfield-based nonprofit.

Last month, Feldman flew down with a team of U-M staff for the 17th surgery in the trial, in anticipation that the trial might soon move to Ann Arbor. The trial has been at Emory University in Atlanta since it began, in part, because Feldman wanted a former U-M neurosurgery resident, Dr. Nicholas Boulis, who is now at Emory, to perform the delicate procedure. Boulis collaborated with Feldman on her research for seven years during his residency.

Feldman is clear and she repeats this often: This part of the trial tests safety only. By design, it doesn't

assess the efficacy of the treatment yet.

So the clinical trial patients so far -- all from the Atlanta area -- know the experimental stem cell therapy probably will not cure them. Still, they're empowered, knowing their participation might one day cure others, said Ed Tessaro, a retired Macy's executive, from his home overlooking a sparkling Georgian lake.

The following morning, Tessaro, 66, lay on an operating room table at Emory's hospital, as doctors sliced through his skin and muscle, removed part of the bone in his spine and laid bare a pulsating, bright-white spinal cord for a second infusion of stem cells.

""It may kill us,"" Tessaro said of the disease, ""but it's not going to defeat us before we die.""

Serving a greater purpose

It was 2008 when a single misstep and near-stumble during a half-marathon in Bangkok, Thailand, first worried Tessaro. It happened more than once. His muscles weakened, even as he stepped up his time at the gym.

Months later, a fresh, young doctor delivered the news to him and his wife, Judy.

They remember it well, even now.

""She said, 'It's the worst thing I could tell you,' "" Judy Tessaro recalled.

"" 'You have ALS, and you have two to four years to live,' "" Ed Tessaro added.

The doctor cried that day. So did Judy and Ed.

""The dynamics are pretty grim -- fatal, no cure. Nobody has ever been cured. ... It takes a while to get your head wrapped around that kind of reality,"" Ed Tessaro said.

But Tessaro took stock. Life had been good, he decided.

Tessaro has been married for 43 years. He has a daughter and son and is a grandfather to two little girls. When he speaks of them, he can't help but grin. And the pictures in the downstairs rec room at the Tessaros' home are of a thrill-filled life: ice-climbing in New Zealand, marveling at the lush green of Vietnamese rice paddies, being stunned by the chase-and-dart flurry of a cheetah taking down a Thomson's gazelle in the Serengeti.

Hiking. Biking. Skydiving.

He thought life couldn't be more vivid. He was wrong.

Now, every conversation, every gentle touch from his wife, the babbling of his grandbabies -- his senses are now in hyperdrive.

""In retrospect, I was living in analog. What I'm now living my life in is high-definition. ... I'm living my life fully, because I know I have less of it,"" Tessaro said.

When he heard about the clinical trial, Tessaro jumped at it, calling it ""the larger-purpose stuff.""

""It's not like I can hope for a miraculous reversal of this disease -- it's not coming,"" he said. ""I don't think I have anything to lose ... and I can be part of something bigger. It's great therapy when you commit yourself to something bigger.""

He became Patient No.12 on April 13. Doctors slipped stem cells into the lower -- or lumbar -- section of his spine. The area that controls lower body movement, it was considered least risky because Tessaro was already losing the strength in his legs anyway. Clinical trial protocol limits risk.

Tessaro survived. In fact, he left the hospital days earlier than expected and felt better sooner than he expected.

So doctors decided -- and the FDA approved -- a second, riskier, surgery for Tessaro. This time, doctors would move to the upper -- or cervical -- portion of Tessaro's spine, the area in which the nerves are responsible for breathing.

Feldman calls this area ""precious real estate,"" the stretch of spine where researchers say they believe the treatment may be most effective.

""Higher risk, but maybe higher reward,"" Tessaro said, shrugging. He was in the pre-operating room of Emory University Hospital, surrounded by family and overnight bags and medical tubes and equipment.

It was July 20.

In a stretch of hallway and an elevator ride away, a nondescript FedEx box was being delivered to Dr. Jonathan Glass, director of the ALS clinic at Emory. His hands were working quickly.

Preparing for surgery

Glass pulled from the temperature-controlled container several vials of the stem cells known as NSI-566RSC. They had been thawed to about 39 degrees and then shipped overnight to Emory by Neuralstem, a Rockville, Md.-based biomedical company that is funding the trial, according to CEO and President Richard Garr.

The company has shelled out about $2.5 million for the first phase of the trial and provided the stem cells, one of the company's premier products. They were drawn and cultured from the spine of an aborted fetus in 2000, then cultured again. They remain frozen until the day before they are ready for use.

They have arrived at Emory at 8 a.m. each surgery day of this trial -- ""never been late,"" said Jane Bordeau, a research nurse and coordinator for the trial at Emory.

Glass separated out some of the liquid to test in separate vials, slipping some drops of blue liquid into the vials and tapping them lightly with a middle finger. He slid them onto a slide and rolled his chair to a microscope.

Dead cells will glow blue, he explained, having absorbed a dye that seeps inside their degrading membranes. Live cells remain clear and bright. At least 70% must be alive to be considered viable and to begin surgery, according to Neuralstem.

Glass began counting.

In an upstairs operating room, a red second hand circled a wall clock.

In the pre-op room, Tessaro had been discussing the 25 videos he planned to make for his toddler-age grandchildren. He knows ALS will steal his voice. So he will travel to the Smoky Mountains, set up a tripod and record for them stories, like how he met their grandmother.

He talked about the two books in his overnight bags, too: Hemingway's ""Farewell to Arms,"" and -- he added, laughing -- ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" because his daughter dared him.

Nearby, his wife was quiet. She fidgeted with an overnight bag.

In his lab, Glass punched some buttons on his cell phone calculator.

""It's cool,"" he announced. By his calculations, 83.6% of the cells had arrived alive.

It was time. The surgery would go as planned.

Surprising the doctors

Ted Harada is on Page 8 of the March Journal of Stem Cells, which published the first study announcing the preliminary results of the first 12 patients.

Harada is the anomaly. Patient No. 11. Like Tessaro did last month, Harada this month will undergo a second surgery. And like with Tessaro, it took some time to diagnose the mysterious weakening of Harada's body.

The former FedEx managing director, now 40, noticed he was getting winded in 2009 while playing Marco Polo in the family pool with his three children: ""I'd go under water and come back up, and I was sucking for air.""

After a string of doctors -- a family doctor, an orthopedist, a neurologist -- the final diagnosis came in August 2010: ALS. The diagnosis was devastating, but the timing couldn't have been better, the neurologist told him.

Clinical trial #NCT01348451 was under way.

By the time Harada, a self-described type A personality, went in for his surgery in March 2011, he was using a cane, unable to walk to the end of the driveway for the mail without losing his breath or to climb the 15 stairs to tuck his children in at night.

He saw the trial as a way to smirk at the disease, to become part of the solution that might one day beat it back for other patients, even if it didn't do a thing for him: ""I did the research, and I said to the doctors, 'Yeah, I'll be your guinea pig.' ""

To his way of thinking, someone had to be the first man on the moon. Someone has to step up for medical research.

Plus, he added, ""I know how the book ends if I do nothing.""

But what happened after his surgery wrote a chapter no one had expected.

The 14 other patients involved in the trial to date have shown no improvement; four have died -- three from complications of ALS, and the other from a heart-related issue, according to Neuralstem.

In contrast, Harada put aside his cane soon after the surgery. And he was again tucking his children into their beds.

Feldman is insistent: Don't read too much into Harada's turnaround. The number of patients is tiny, and Ted is an oddity among them.

Still, Harada's improvement, even if temporary, can't be ignored.

The researchers have used several tests to measure patients' outcomes, such as breathing capacity, the strength of their handgrip, and even the electrical impulses that flow through their muscles. There on these graphs is Harada, his dotted lines suddenly shooting upward after surgery.

In designing the clinical trial, ""we were only aiming at stopping the disease,"" said Dr. Karl Johe, chairman and chief scientific officer of Neuralstem. ""But this is a patient that has clearly improved.""

Recently, Harada has begun to get winded again climbing the steps to his children's bedrooms. He and wife, Michelle, 39, a sixth-grade teacher, have explained to their children that he probably won't get better this time.

In her worst moments, Michelle has foreseen graduations and Christmases and grandchildren without him.

In their kitchen, the Haradas' children had just finished slathering peanut butter on bread and disappeared upstairs. A deeply religious couple, the Haradas said they'll take what they can get.

""We've been blessed,"" he said.

Michelle Harada agreed, struggling against a surge of tears: ""The surgery gave us two years back.""

Paving the way for others

Ed Tessaro was facedown, mostly draped in surgery blue in the crowded Emory operating room . It was 12:23 p.m. on July 20.

A stainless steel, crane-like contraption had been screwed into the cervical section of his spine. A steady beep-beep-beep of the monitors punctuated the hiss of a respirator. A digital camera recorded every movement for the FDA.

Standing just a few feet from Boulis, Glass was ready, with the spinal cord exposed.

It was 2:34 p.m. when Boulis asked for the cells.

For the next half hour, the vials were readied for the patented apparatus, on which an injection device slid along a guide to Tessaro's spinal cord. It would inject 100,000 cells for each of five stops precisely 4 millimeters apart.

The target was the ventral horn of the spinal cord, a tiny area associated with motor neurons.

""Just looking at the spine can hurt it,"" Glass had said earlier.

At 3:06 p.m., the injection device slid into place. A needle extended, injecting deep into the spinal cord and, for two minutes, the stem cells were forced into the ventral horn.

At 3:29 p.m., the fifth and final injection began, and two minutes later, the relief was palpable. From her viewing spot just a few yards from Tessaro's neck, Feldman shifted on her feet and exhaled. The procedure, from start to finish, took a little more than six hours.

Technicians began to check recordings and run over the notes for the FDA. Boulis and the others began the process of removing the device and closing in the gaping hole in Tessaro's back.

""Can we get some music in here?"" Boulis said.

Whiz Khalifa's rap filled the OR.

Feldman transferred the digital recording of the process to a memory stick she could review back at the office. A copy would go to the FDA, too.

There will be many more months of data, continued animal tests and most likely, hundreds of pages of reports.

Even if this early stage is proved safe and the clinical trial continues, doctors must figure out whether these are the stem cells that work best in this therapy, and, if so, in what amounts and injected into which areas. There's the issue of the patients' bodies rejecting these foreign bodies, too.

""This is not a small molecule pill, and your patients go ... home and take the pill and you see them in your clinic in a few months,"" said Steve Perrin, CEO of ALS Therapy Development Institute, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit focused on finding a treatment or cure for ALS. ""These are the challenges this trial and this technology have in front of (them). They're paving the road, because no one has been down this way before.""

On Friday, Tessaro was recuperating at home.

Waiting for any good news

In the Kleiss' Royal Oak home these days, Riley the bassett hound has learned that her owner's lap is no longer hers.

The Kleisses continue to wait for any news they can on ALS -- possible cures, treatment, a clinical trial that could involve Regis -- ""anything,"" Mary Kleiss said.

Her son's voice is gone, so his words are more carefully chosen these days. It's tedious work: A reflective dot on Regis Kleiss' forehead strikes the digital keys on a laptop screen in front of him as he twitches and turns his head to manipulate the words. ""Y Me"" he wrote, in April:

""It sucks to watch my body fai

l.

""While my mind n emotions r completely intact

""Knowing full well the end result

""And the road I'll be forced to walk

""Becoming a prisoner in my own body

""Watching my world fly by

""Remembering how life used to be

""Missing so much of life.""

Magnetic stimulation helps some people with treatment-resistant depression

By Julie Appleby,

Christine Curtis of Sterling says she is a “happy mom” again, crediting her recovery from debilitating depression to an expensive treatment that sends magnetic pulses into the brain.

“I can’t put a price on it,” said Curtis, 36, who said she feels better than she has in a decade after completing 30 days of the procedure, called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS.

An increasing number of psychiatrists and hospitals — as well as entrepreneurs opening rTMS centers around the country — are betting that there are millions of people like Curtis, discouraged by depression treatments that have proved unsuccessful and willing to pony up thousands of dollars for the possibility of relief. The treatment, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is covered by Medicare in five states, but few private insurers pay for it routinely.

While rTMS has ardent supporters, its effectiveness is still debated, and there is little evidence showing how long the results last. The technique has been shown to work better than a placebo, but the proportion of patients who show complete relief ranges widely, from as few as 10 percent to as many as 57 percent, according to various studies.

The debate has huge implications, not just for many of the 14 million Americans who suffer from major depression every year but also for businesses eyeing a potentially lucrative market and insurers weighing whether to cover it.

About half of those 14 million Americans seek relief through psychotherapy and prescription drug treatment, according to an evaluation by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. But studies show that antidepressants provide complete cessation of symptoms only about a third of the time. Magnetic stimulation is aimed at patients with such “treatment-resistant depression.”

Supporters say rTMS is worth the cost — between $6,000 and $12,000 for the four-to-six-week treatment — because it enables people such as Curtis to resume productive lives.

Skeptics question the price tag in light of uncertain benefits.

“The majority of studies that evaluated rTMS failed to find evidence of an enduring treatment effect after the initial response . . . and some . . . failed to find any significant treatment effect,” concluded Health Plan of Nevada, a UnitedHealthcare insurer, which rejected coverage in March.

With the nation’s health-care spending expected to top $2.7 trillion this year, the battle over paying for rTMS demonstrates why it is so difficult to rein in health-care costs. New technology is generally allowed into the market after studies show it is reasonably safe and more effective than placebos. But that’s not the same as showing it works better than current approaches.

Experts differ over whether it’s smart to cover new techniques if they haven’t proved superior to established methods. And they can also disagree over the medical research itself: Was a study done well? Were there enough patients enrolled? Did it ask the right questions? Insurers often call for more research, while doctors and patients — many desperate for help — warn against delay. And costs are rarely discussed publicly.

‘What did I have to lose?’

In December, when Curtis first had a magnetic coil placed on her scalp while a $70,000 machine sent pulses into part of her brain, she had already spent a decade trying seven different prescription medications in her battle with depression.

Getting no relief but gaining weight and feeling sluggish and “out of it” because of the drugs’ side effects, she eagerly agreed to the month-long series of five-day-a-week treatments. Most patients have between four and six weeks of near daily sessions.

Curtis’s psychiatrist, Niku Singh, who is also the medical director at TMS NeuroHealth, suggested that she try the procedure. “I was all for it,” said Curtis, whose insurance did not cover the treatment. “It’s a matter of nothing else had worked, so what did I have to lose?”

As the very first patient treated at the Tysons Corner facility, which opened in December, Curtis paid only $3,000 because the center needed a test patient to meet the requirements of the device manufacturer. The fee is generally about $10,000, but officials say they work with patients who can't afford that. Founders of the center compare rTMS’s potential to that of the now-ubiquitous laser eye clinics; they aim to open a chain of centers nationally that will take walk-ins and accept referrals from physicians. Walk-in patients without a doctor referral would be screened by the center’s medical director to determine if they are in fact appropriate candidates for rTMS treatment.

“We looked at the Lasik model and said, ‘Can we do this with depression? Can we do this with TMS?’” said Bill Leonard, president of the company.

During a treatment, a patient sits in a chair like one in a dentist’s office while an electromagnetic coil is placed against her head. The machine sends four seconds of magnetic pulses into the brain in 26-second intervals, making a woodpecker-like tapping noise. The whole procedure takes about 40 minutes and is monitored by a technician. Patients say it does not hurt. Studies have shown that side effects are few and generally minor, such as headaches and scalp irritations.

Singh said rTMS works by having the pulses stimulate a region of the brain that helps control mood; researchers say the pulses help depression by activating the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. (Singh, who owns two psychiatry practices in the region, says he does not have an investment interest in TMS NeuroHealth.)

The use of rTMS for altering mood or affecting the brain has been studied since at least the early 1990s. After reviewing data from a study of 301 patients, the FDA cleared the device in 2008 for the treatment of major depression in adults who had failed to improve after at least one round of drug therapy.

That study was funded by the device’s manufacturer, Neuronetics, a company based in Malvern, Pa. It found that up to 17 percent of patients treated with the device for six weeks became symptom-free, about twice as many as those treated with a sham rTMS machine.

Subsequent studies have shown a range of results, with about a third of patients reporting complete relief. One 2010 study of 199 “moderately treatment resistent” patients funded by the National Institute of Mental Health found that rTMS was four times as likely to get patients symptom-free as was a sham procedure. Patients in that study were treated five times a week for three to five weeks. One key measure — known as the “number needed to treat” — found that one patient became symptom-free for every 12 who were treated. Five percent of the patients in the sham group became symptom-free.

Supporters such as those at TMS NeuroHealth say they are seeing better results than that among their patients, who can continue taking antidepressants along with their treatment. Curtis, for example, still takes a daily antidepressant four months after completing her treatment, but she has been able to sharply reduce the dosage.

Curtis said she noticed no change in her depression at the very start of her rTMS treatment, but she began feeling better after about two weeks of treatment. “I’m not up and down anymore,” she said.

For patients who don’t respond to prescription drugs and talk therapy, the other major option is electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, in which an electrical current is sent through the brain to deliberately cause a seizure. The procedure, which is more widely used than rTMS, requires two to three treatments a week for three to four weeks and is effective for many patients. But it requires anesthesia and sometimes causes memory loss or confusion. rTMS does not require anesthesia, and its side effects are generally mild. A few small studies have looked at its effects on cognitive function and found either no effect or slight improvement, according to the AHRQ analysis. The costs of ECT — typically about $3,300 for four weeks of thrice-weekly treatments, according to AHRQ data — are covered by most private insurers as well as by Medicare and Medicaid. The cost is higher, however, if a patient must be admitted to the hospital.

Comparable to drug therapy

Linda Carpenter, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, who has conducted medical studies using rTMS for depressed patients, says the treatment is effective for some patients, possibly even better than simply trying another medication. But she says questions remain about how long the effects last and how often a patient should return for additional sessions.

“What’s the range of booster treatments people need?” she asks. “Is it once a week, or every couple of years? There’s a huge range in my clinical experience.” Carpenter, a physician, says research has not found any safety issues for patients returning for additional treatments, but cost is a factor.

Uncertainty about its long-term effectiveness is why most insurers do not routinely cover rTMS. Medicare also has mainly rejected coverage, though in January, the administrator of the program’s New England region became the first to approve it, citing the AHRQ report and an assessment from an independent regional advisory board.

That 19-member panel voted 10 to 5 last year that studies of the treatment showed it to be as good as or better than usual care for depression. Six of the 10 said it represented a “reasonable” value for its cost; four saw it as a low value. (The same panel voted 9 to 6 that rTMS’s health benefit was equal to that of ECT.) A similar coverage decision proposal is being considered by the Medicare office serving the Washington region.

Even with limited insurance coverage, about 8,000 patients have had the treatment, and the number of treatment centers has doubled to a total of about 400 nationwise since 2010, according to reports by the device’s maker. Centers include some big names, such as Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

Still, some are not convinced. “The initial treatment with rTMS is $12,000: That’s a lot of generic Prozac or Effexor,” which are cost-effective antidepressants with long track records, said Joel Rubinstein, associate medical director of Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare, an insurer that does not cover rTMS. “Managed care has an obligation to a population. You’re shepherding a fixed amount of resources across a large population and trying to do it according to some sort of evidence-based system.”

story_reviews_00836,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A small U.S. study suggests daily hormone injections may boost mental agility in older people with and without mild cognitive problems.

People who got growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), as opposed to inactive injections, improved on tests of attention and concentration skills - what psychologists call executive function.

And participants who got the hormone shots also felt the effects in their daily life, said Laura Baker, a memory researcher at the University of Washington & VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle.

“On self-report, many of the folks in the active group reported they felt better,” Baker, who led the study, told Reuters Health. “They wanted to know where they could get (the hormone) after the study was over.”

But that’s jumping the gun, she warned, because the treatment is still experimental and GHRH is not approved to treat mental decline. What’s more, the hormone, which was provided free by the manufacturer in the study, today costs $700 for a single shot, Baker said.

An expert who wasn’t involved in the research echoed the cautions.

“I think it’s potentially good news, but I don’t think it’s to the point where people should go out and start using it,” said Dr. Ronald C. Petersen, who heads the Mayo Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota.

The new study, published Monday in the Archives of Neurology, included 152 people aged 55 to 87. Sixty-six had “mild cognitive impairment,” which falls somewhere between normal forgetfulness and dementia.

Baker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.

But recent work by one of Baker’s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer’s disease - although that’s far from conclusive yet.

GHRH, a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain, is linked to the insulin system, but also has a host of other effects. It dwindles naturally with aging, which has been linked to declines in memory and executive function.

“All you have to do is supplement that hormone and it then will result in a whole cascade of effects that then restore an aging system to a younger system,” said Baker.

In her study, people injected a synthetic version of GHRH or a placebo daily for five months. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment.

It’s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. One test, for instance, asked participants to name the color of a font - say, green - used to write the name of a different color - say, “red”. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day.

The researchers found no serious side effects in the study, although people who got the hormone more often complained of symptoms like skin reactions and joint pain.

Still, both Baker and Petersen said more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections. It’s possible health problems could show up down the road, and the mental boost may be short-lived.

“Is it going to work in the long run and is it going to be safe? That is still unknown,” said Petersen.

Baker added that it’s too early to say whether the hormone could play a role in thwarting the development of Alzheimer’s, which may affect as many as five million Americans.

Still, she said, “There are things we can all do to postpone (mental) decline.” Keeping medical conditions such as diabetes under control and getting regular exercise are two examples.

“We recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,” Baker said. “Our work and others’ has shown that exercise really does make a difference.”

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Aug. 6, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Treatment with growth hormone-releasing hormone improves memory and focus in healthy adults and in those who already show some signs of mental decline, new research finds.

""Growth hormone-releasing hormone doesn't target one specific area in the body and brain,"" said study lead author Laura Baker, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle. ""It stimulates a whole cascade of hormones in the body and brain; it stimulates normal function of a system that was working at a younger age so that cells can do what they were programmed to do at birth.""

Results of the study are published in the Aug. 6 issue of the Archives of Neurology.

As levels of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) decrease with age, so too do other hormones stimulated by GHRH, such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1. All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

In a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don't yet have Alzheimer's disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they're at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Foundation.

In all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.

The study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.

Study funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Tests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.

Baker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in ""planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another"" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren't as strong as for the executive function tasks.

Treatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. ""IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,"" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer's disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.

Benefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.

Insulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn't clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.

Dr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.

""This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,"" Zonszein said. ""The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation. And, we don't know what would happen if we gave it chronically.""

For instance, ""would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?"" he said.

""There may be both good and bad effects,"" Zonszein added.

The researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone's therapeutic potential.

story_reviews_00838,"July 30, 2012 -- If it weren't for routine PSA prostate cancer screening, an extra 17,000 Americans each year would learn that they had the worst form of the disease, a new study suggests.

That kind of prostate cancer -- metastatic prostate cancer, in which the cancer spreads to the bone or other parts of the body -- is rapidly fatal, usually within two years or less.

The new study seems to make a powerful argument in favor of PSA testing. It finds that in the three years before widespread PSA testing (1983-1985), men getting their first diagnosis of prostate cancer were three times more likely to learn they had very late-stage cancer than men diagnosed in the most recent three years for which data is available (2006-2008).

""By not using PSA tests in the vast majority of men, you have to accept you are going to increase very serious metastatic disease threefold,"" says study leader Edward Messing, MD, chief of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.

In 2008, about 8,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. By projecting data from the pre-PSA era forward, Messing calculates that without routine PSA tests, 25,000 men would have been diagnosed in 2008 -- an extra 17,000 cases of deadly disease.

But it's not that simple, says Barnett Kramer, MD, MPH, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. Studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.

For example, Kramer says, what if a man got a PSA test when his prostate cancer was in the very earliest stages of metastatic disease? Microscopic cancers already have seeded his body. But he would not yet have symptoms or detectable metastatic disease, so he'd be diagnosed with earlier-stage disease. He's subtracted forever from the men whose first diagnosis was late-stage disease, even though screening could not save his life.

Messing says this misses the point of his study, which appears in the online July 30 issue of the journal Cancer.",Study: PSA Testing Cuts Worst Prostate Cancers,4,Cancer
story_reviews_00839,"By Steven Reinberg

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, July 30 (HealthDay News) -- In the wake of a widely publicized report advising against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer, a new study finds not screening would triple the number of U.S. men developing advanced cancer.

Testing, on the other hand, might keep some 17,000 men each year from receiving a diagnosis of late-stage prostate cancer -- cancer that has spread and is far less curable -- the study finds.

""PSA testing, for all its pluses and minuses and all that . . . permits you to catch the disease earlier,"" said lead researcher Dr. Edward Messing, chair of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, N.Y.

""These people are all going to die, they are going to die incredibly expensively and die miserably,"" he said, referring to the many men whose diagnoses would be delayed by not testing. ""I don't know that all these people could be saved with PSA testing,"" but many could, he added.

The report was published online July 30 in the journal Cancer.

Messing said the annual number of prostate cancer deaths dropped from about 42,000 in the 1990s to 28,000 now. ""The only thing that can explain that is PSA early detection and treatment,"" he said.

Many cases of prostate cancer are not life-threatening, which is why testing is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in May recommended against routine PSA screening, saying too many non-lethal cancers were being treated aggressively, exposing men who didn't need treatment to serious side effects such as impotence and urinary incontinence.

But Messing disagreed with that advice. Condemning PSA testing ""wasn't a brilliant conclusion,"" he said.

For the new study, Messing's team compared information from the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for the years 1983 to 1985 -- immediately before widespread PSA testing started --- to data from 2006 through 2008.

In the 2008 data, 8,000 cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed after the malignancy had spread to other parts of the body.

Using these cases as a base, the researchers constructed a model that used data of advanced cancer diagnosed in the 1980s and predicted how many cases of advanced cancer would have been diagnosed in 2008 if PSA testing was not done.

Their model showed instead of 8,000 actual cases in 2008, about 25,000 cases would have been diagnosed.

But the USPSTF maintains the benefits of testing are overrated. ""The task force recommends against prostate cancer screening using the PSA test, as the potential benefit does not outweigh the harms,"" said Dr. Michael LeFevre, co-vice chair of the task force and professor in the department of family and community medicine at the University of Missouri School of Medicine.

As a result of treatments for PSA-detected prostate cancer, one out of 1,000 men screened in the United States develops a blood clot in his legs or lungs, two will have a heart attack or stroke, and up to 40 are left impotent or with urinary incontinence, LeFevre said.

""At best, only one of these 1,000 men who were screened avoids dying from prostate cancer for at least 10 years,"" LeFevre said. ""In addition, about one in every 3,000 men screened dies as a result of surgery to treat cancer detected by the PSA test.""

Still, the task force recognizes that ""some men may continue requesting the PSA test and some physicians may continue offering it,"" LeFevre said.

Before getting this blood test -- which measures a protein in cells of the prostate gland -- men should learn about the pros and cons, he said. ""The decision to start or continue screening should reflect an understanding of the possible benefits and known harms, and should respect each individual's preferences.""

Messing advises men with a family history of prostate cancer or urinary symptoms to have a PSA test. Men with no family history or symptoms should discuss PSA testing with their doctor, he added.

Messing pointed out that screening-detected cancer doesn't mean surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatment must follow. Most cases can be watched for some time, he said.

Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said over the past few years a number of studies have been published on the benefits and harms of PSA testing.

""None of these studies can be considered decisive other than in proving that there are some harms associated with treatment,"" he said. The American Cancer Society still supports screening for certain men in consultation with a physician.

Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. In 2012, more than 240,000 new cases are expected to be diagnosed, and 28,000 men will die from the disease, researchers say.

story_reviews_00840,"According to a U.S. government advisory panel, almost no one should get screened for prostate cancer. But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. To screen or not to screen: here's why experts still can't agree

Mike Albans / NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images PSA blood testing at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y.

If you’re wondering why experts still can’t agree on prostate-cancer screening, you’re not alone.

Just two months ago, a major U.S. government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer, claiming the simple blood test for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, does more harm than good. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal.

“Almost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer,” urologist and study author Edward Messing told reporters, as he explained the importance of his study.

The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely.

(MORE: Men Should Forgo PSA Testing, U.S. Panel Advises)

No one denies that PSA tests can help to catch prostate cancer early. But two issues are still unresolved. One is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths; the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits.

On the first issue, there is still some uncertainty. In the U.S., a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening. But an even larger randomized clinical trial in Europe has found a benefit. In its latest results published this spring, the European study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate-cancer death after 11 years.

Still, the real crux of the debate on PSA testing is the second issue: the possible negative effects of screening. No diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and if a PSA test comes back positive for prostate cancer, the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. That test can have side effects. Then, if the patient does have cancer, the available treatments for it — surgery, radiation, as well as other options — also have side effects, chief among them impotence, incontinence, and urinary incontinence. The same European trial that found lower cancer mortality with PSA testing also found that, to save just one life through screening, an extra 37 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated. Many health experts think that’s too much risky treatment to justify the results.

So when the government advisory panel — the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — recommends against routine PSA testing, it’s making a judgment call. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. But that decision does remain a judgment call. It depends on how much you value certain quality-of-life measures versus how much you value having any life at all.

(MORE: Surgery for Early Prostate Cancer Doesn’t Save Lives)

As for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren’t for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer — and its numbers deserve a little explanation. To calculate the total number of metastatic cases we’d get without screening, the study takes today’s population of the United States and applies the rates (broken down by age and race) of advanced-stage prostate cancer that were observed before PSA testing was introduced — that is, the rates way back in 1983-85.

In other words, it tells us what the current U.S. population would look like if today we faced the same risks that Americans faced in the ’80s; it finds we’d have roughly 25,000 U.S. men diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer each year compared to just 8,000 today. But is going back in time 30 years really the same thing that we’d get if we abolished PSA testing today? Who knows? The rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years. However, prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that’s not strongly linked to smoking (and falling cigarette consumption over the past 40 years is a major reason for falling cancer rates). It is, however, linked to obesity, which has been on the rise since the 1980s.

One further fact to keep in mind is that PSA testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced-stage cancers — but it does so by increasing the number of cancers that are caught early. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process. That’s what experts can’t agree about.

Many doctors do have very strong opinions, though. As a patient, if you’re deciding whether to get a PSA test, or whether not to get a PSA test, remember you do have a right to your own opinion too. There’s no easy answer.

story_reviews_00841,"A tiny but promising study suggests that a medicine used for immune disorders may offer long-term benefits to Alzheimer's patients—a result likely to spur demand for the treatment even though it is in limited supply and isn't approved for the memory-debilitating disease.

The treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIG, is made from the blood plasma of healthy young adults. Since 2004 it had shown early promise for Alzheimer's, which afflicts some five million Americans.

In the new study, four patients with a mild to moderate form of the disease who had been taking an IVIG drug for three years saw their cognitive ability and behavior stabilize, meaning their symptoms didn't get worse, said Norman Relkin, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who presented the findings at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The finding is striking because people diagnosed with Alzheimer's typically see dramatic memory declines within 18 months, if not much sooner.

The patients in the study used a version of IVIG from Baxter International BAX 0.76% Inc. called Gammagard. The results suggest Gammagard ""is a viable long-term therapy in this group"" of Alzheimer's patients, said Dr. Relkin.

These new data represent the longest follow-up to date on patients from Baxter's midstage clinical trial. Earlier results were encouraging enough to prompt the company in 2007 to move Gammagard into late-stage testing for Alzheimer's. Results from this phase III testing are expected in early 2013.

William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzheimer's Association, a group that funds research into the disease, called the findings ""tantalizing"" but said more work is needed. Dr. Thies wasn't involved in the study.

It is important to be cautious about the results due to the small sample size and because patients and investigators knew the patients were getting the medicine, which could have influenced the findings, said Rudy Tanzi, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School.

""We have to wait for a proper phase III [trial] before we reach a conclusion,"" said Dr. Tanzi, who wasn't involved in the study. ""It's almost like a crapshoot; it's just too small to predict.""

Nevertheless, doctors who work with Alzheimer's patients said they expect patients and families to clamor for the drug. Many said they have been asked about Gammagard for years, and this latest positive result is likely to bring an increase.

In February, when results in mice were published suggesting that a skin-cancer drug, bexarotene, was beneficial for Alzheimer's, many patients or their families started calling their doctors to ask whether they should use it off-label.

A spokesman for Baxter said the company ""does not support the use of its therapies for unapproved indications. Further, it remains difficult to monitor the use of our IG products for Alzheimer's disease.""

Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for specific uses, but doctors can prescribe them for other purposes. With any off-label use, there are concerns about safety and efficacy. With Gammagard, there is an additional concern about supply.

IVIG is costly and difficult to make. Baxter, one of several companies that make it, says it takes 130 plasma donations to make enough to treat one patient with primary immunodeficiency for a year.

""The findings are highly promising but nevertheless a double-edged sword due to the limited supply,"" said P. Murali Doraiswamy, an Alzheimer's researcher at Duke University who wasn't involved in the study but previously served as an adviser to Baxter. ""The growing off-label demand for Alzheimer's could threaten supply for immunodeficient patients.""

It isn't clear how the treatment helps Alzheimer's patients, but it appears to take advantage of antibodies from the plasma donors that combat a protein called amyloid, which clumps in the brains of people with the ailment.

The drug is approved for a number of conditions, particularly diseases of the immune system, and many patients who use it have life-threatening conditions. Multiple companies make IVIG, but only Gammagard is in advanced clinical testing for use in Alzheimer's.

Gayatri Devi, director of New York Memory Services, which treats patients with neurological conditions, has used Gammagard to treat Alzheimer's for about seven years. She says she started trying it after a patient's husband approached her in 2005 after hearing about an early clinical-trial result on TV.Dr. Devi has since treated several other patients with Gammagard, which involves lengthy office infusions every two to three weeks. She says she measures patients' functioning before starting treatment and six months later to see whether they should continue. She began with patients whose functioning seemed to be deteriorating significantly and more recently has started treating mild patients to see if she can slow the disease progression.About 70% of her patients have responded, to varying degrees, though none as significantly as her first patient, said Dr. Devi.

But only about 5% of her patients can afford it, she said. It can cost more than $50,000 a year, and its use as an Alzheimer's treatment isn't covered by insurance.""The jury is still out [about Gammagard], but there's a lot of evidence that suggests that something like this seems to help a significant proportion of patients with Alzheimer's who currently don't have any other available treatments,"" said Dr. Devi.

The first patient, who had been diagnosed with the disease about eight years before she started Gammagard, had trouble walking and talking. Under Gammagard, the patient experienced impressive improvements in her language and movement, Dr. Devi said.

Several of her patients have exhibited side effects. One developed a serious allergic reaction, two had kidney insufficiencies that reversed when they stopped and a few have had mild skin rashes that went away as they stayed on the treatment.

story_reviews_00842,"Take two slices of cherry pie and call me in the morning.

OK. That’s not quite the advice doctors are wont to give. But it might make at least a sliver of sense.

Cherry pie contains the same sort of anti-inflammatory compounds as aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — at least the cherries do. They’re tart, or sour, cherries, which, as far as is known, contain more of these anti-inflammatory compounds than any other food, says Dr. Kerry Kuehl, assistant director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.

Kuehl is a coauthor of a new study suggesting that tart cherries could someday provide an alternative treatment for patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis who can’t tolerate the standard drug therapy.

Participants in the study — presented at the American College of Sports Medicine Conference in San Francisco in May —- were 20 women, 40 to 70 years old, who had all been diagnosed with inflammatory osteoarthritis and had experienced joint swelling at least once in the last year. Twice a day, half of the women drank 10.5 fluid ounces of tart cherry juice. The other half drank that much fake cherry juice with the same calorie content, flavor and consistency.

After three weeks, the women who got the real stuff had significantly less inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein in their blood, than those who had been drinking the counterfeit.

The anti-inflammatory powers of tart cherries can make them a smart choice for healthy people too. In a number of studies, athletes who drank tart cherry juice before running a race or doing intensive strength exercises felt less pain afterward and bounced back faster than those who didn’t.

But tart cherries aren’t just loaded with wham-bam anti-inflammatories. They’re chockablock with antioxidants. And a 2011 study in the European Journal of Nutrition suggests that drinking tart cherry juice during the day may pay off in better snoozing at night, thanks to high levels of the sleep-regulating antioxidant melatonin.

These studies have been done with people, but other promising research has only been done with lab animals so far. In one 2009 study in the Journal of Medicinal Food, tart cherries helped fat rats. Not our favorite role models perhaps, but the obese beasties’ risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease were reduced significantly, and parallel studies are now in the works with members of our own species, says lead author E. Mitchell Seymour: “There are some interesting and potentially exciting results on the horizon. Stay tuned.”

So, what’s not to like about tart cherries? Not much ... except for maybe the “tart” part. Let’s just say, the cherry topping off your hot fudge sundae is not a tart cherry. The alluring cherries in the produce aisle are not tart cherries. And those cherries that a happy life is supposedly just a bowl of? They’re not tart cherries either.

“Tart cherries are extremely bitter raw,” Kuehl admits. “Unpalatable.”

But hey! There is a solution: Don’t eat tart cherries raw. Eat them dried or frozen (in smoothies) or drink them in juice. Even unsweetened, something about juicing makes them taste better, Kuehl says. “Some people really like it.”

And, of course, you can always bake a pie.

story_reviews_00843,"After her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age 63, Patricia Walters talked to her doctor, Leslie Cho, about how to better monitor her own heart health.

Pregnant at the time with her own daughter, Ms. Walters, now 46, says she was ""a nervous wreck"" worrying that she, too, might face serious cardiac risk.

As part of an overall health evaluation after the pregnancy, Dr. Cho, director of the Women's Cardiovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic, recommended a simple blood test called hs-CRP—for high sensitivity C-reactive protein, which is a marker for inflammation in the body.

Easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening, and covered by most insurance, the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart-attack and stroke risk.

Greater Accuracy

The hs-CRP test is a newer, more sensitive version of a standard CRP check, and experts say it can more accurately detect lower concentrations of the protein, making it more useful in predicting a healthy person's risk for cardiovascular disease. It measures CRP in milligrams per liter of blood: less than 1.0 mg/l is considered low risk; 1.0 to 3.0 mg/l is average risk; and greater than 3.0 mg/l is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology both have endorsed the use of hs-CRP for ""intermediate risk"" individuals. And one major study suggests that even people with minimal risk factors in their late 50s and early 60s should have the test.

While inflammation is the body's natural response to a variety of physical states, including fever, injury and infection, research shows it also plays a role in a range of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation of the arteries has been linked to heart attack, sudden death and stroke, Dr. Cho notes.

Those who smoke, have high blood pressure, and are overweight and sedentary tend to have high levels of CRP—and those who are thin and fit have lower levels. But genetic factors can also contribute to elevated CRP in people without traditional risk factors.

Research shows that elevated levels of CRP are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels. A 1997 study of healthy physicians, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated CRP levels. And the Harvard Women's Health Study, which looked at 12 different markers of inflammation in healthy postmenopausal women, found that after three years CRP was the strongest predictor of risk.

Not-So-Low Risk

While some experts don't think the hs-CRP test adds much to current cardiovascular risk-prediction strategies, others say a large study known as the Jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart trouble—and determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs. The 2008 study showed that in patients with low levels of LDL—the bad cholesterol—but high hs-CRP levels, the statin Crestor reduced the risk of heart-related death, heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by 44% compared with those given placebos.

Paul Ridker, a Harvard University researcher who led the Jupiter study, says, ""We know that those with elevated hs-CRP are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low, and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group."" While the study showed inflammation contributes as much to cardiovascular risk as does high blood pressure or high cholesterol, Dr. Ridker says ""the core research question now is whether or not reducing inflammation per se will reduce that risk.""

His team has now launched two major clinical trials—one funded by the federal government and one by industry—to address that question. (Dr. Ridker is co-inventor on patents held by Brigham and Women's Hospital related to the use of inflammatory biomarkers including hs-CRP in evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.)

Something to Talk About

Dr. Cho at the Cleveland Clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment.

""If you are 53 and chubby with high blood pressure and borderline high cholesterol but your CRP is normal, I'm not sure I would throw the whole kitchen sink at you,"" says Dr. Cho. ""But if your CRP was elevated, I would want to talk to you about the Jupiter results"" and discuss starting a statin. She also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss, nutrition and exercise.

Ms. Walters didn't have high levels when she was first tested, but they began to rise in later screenings. She now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly. She also joined Weight Watchers to drop a few pounds and runs with friends for exercise.

A former teacher who is now a stay-at-home mom, Ms. Walters says, ""I have a little girl, and I plan to be here for everything.""

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, July 9, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A daily drink combining several nutrients appears to help people with early Alzheimer's disease improve their memory, a new study suggests.

As Alzheimer's progresses, patients lose their memory as synapses (connections between brain cells) deteriorate, according to background information included in the study. The new drink, called Souvenaid, may actually stimulate the growth of new synapses, said the drink's inventor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Richard Wurtman.

But more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. And, even then, consumers should exercise caution, said William Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association.

Nutricia, a division of Dannon, sponsored the study. MIT has a patent on Souvenaid, and Nutricia has the exclusive license on the patent.

""Existing data now suggests that it may be possible to receive something that will sustain cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease with a limited concern about side effects,"" Wurtman said.

Previous experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said.

For the new study, nearly 260 early Alzheimer's patients in Europe drank either Souvenaid or a placebo for six months.

During the first three months of the study, patients in both groups showed improved memory. After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer's patients.

Whether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. ""I don't think it has any effect on the fundamental diseases process, but we'll see,"" he said.

The report was published in the July 10 online edition of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

The drink combines three ingredients: choline, uridine and omega-3 fatty acids.

Choline is a B vitamin found in meats, nuts and eggs, and omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, eggs, flaxseed and meat from grass-fed animals. Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.

These nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.

Nearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.

To show the drink's effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.

Since EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.

An earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.

There are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.

""Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,"" Green said. ""No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed. It is probable that any introduction would take place first in Europe.""

An ongoing study will evaluate the product over two years. If it appears to have a positive effect, then it may be something that could benefit patients even before definitive symptoms of Alzheimer's appear, Wurtman said.

Thies, of the Alzheimer's Association, is very cautious about the benefits of Souvenaid.

""Medical foods do not have a requirement for FDA premarket approval, but they do have a requirement for having a scientific foundation and some evidence of efficacy,"" he said. ""But they don't have the kind of data we would find for a medication.""

That makes it difficult to make a clear-cut statement about the value of the product, he said.

""There isn't a clear diet that prevents you from getting Alzheimer's disease or improves your memory,"" Thies said.

In addition, medical foods for Alzheimer's most likely won't be covered by insurance, he said.

""You are making a judgment without the protections you have when dealing with a medication,"" Thies said. ""You're going to be making a decision using your own funds and we would advise anybody to make sure they understand what the product offers and make sure they understand what it's going to cost.""

story_reviews_00845,"Mrs. McDaniel’s story offers a sobering look at the challenges for this kind of quest for a treatment, even for someone like her, who had both the means and the connections to get the intricate geography of her cancer charted. Her husband, Roger McDaniel, was a former chief executive of two companies involved in semiconductor manufacturing, and the family could afford the approximately $49,000 that the search would cost. They had expected to pay much more, but to their astonishment, Mrs. McDaniel’s insurance company covered almost all the drug costs. And the scientists who did the data analysis did not charge.

From the start, the family knew the odds were against Mrs. McDaniel, but she thought she had little to lose.

“You cannot feel bad if this doesn’t work or I die,” she told her son Timothy, a molecular biologist. “I would have died anyway.”

Scarlet Skin and Infections

Beth McDaniel’s cancer began with itching all over her body. Then her skin turned scarlet and started becoming infected.

In 2005, after she had spent more than a year going from specialist to specialist, a dermatologist figured it out. Mrs. McDaniel, then 62, had Sezary syndrome, a rare T cell lymphoma, in which white blood cells become cancerous and migrate to the skin. All her doctors could tell her was that the disease was incurable, that there was no standard treatment, and that on average patients at her stage die within a few years.

“Of course I was shocked,” Mrs. McDaniel said in an interview last September.

She wept that day as her husband drove her home. And she asked God to help her cope.

Before cancer, she had had a vibrant life, hiking in the mountains, traveling the world, entertaining her wide network of friends. Her disease destroyed all of that. She could not even enjoy her luxuriant garden because sun on her inflamed skin was agony.

Although there is no standard treatment, for five years chemotherapy held her disease at bay. But in the summer of 2010, she got worse, much worse, with hundreds of tumors popping up under her skin. Some grew as large as kiwi fruits and split open.

Her son, Dr. McDaniel, decided he would orchestrate the use of the most advanced techniques of gene sequencing and analysis to take on her cancer. Because of his job — he works for Illumina , a company that does DNA sequencing — Dr. McDaniel had read scientific reports and gone to medical conferences where he heard talks on whole genome sequencing. He noticed that the patients all seemed to have rare cancers.

“Every time I heard one of those stories, I thought, ‘That’s my mom,’ ” he said.

For now, there are not many drugs that can target specific gene mutations in cancer cells.

But the hope is that when more is known and more drugs are developed, doctors will treat cancer by blocking several major genes at once. With several escape routes barred, the cancer will not be able to break free of the drugs stopping its growth.

Full-Time Help From a Son

In theory, it seemed straightforward for Dr. McDaniel to help his mother. The technology for getting and analyzing DNA sequences has advanced greatly, and the cost has plummeted. In fact, Dr. McDaniel said, the price of sequencing has dropped so fast that if the work were done today, it would cost just $26,200 instead of the $46,280 it cost last year.

The first obstacle was just getting a sample of Mrs. McDaniel’s cancer cells. One doctor told her the odds of success were so slim that she would be better off spending her money on a vacation. Another seemed interested but did not follow through. A third did two biopsies but was unable to get usable DNA.

Finally, Dr. McDaniel and his wife, Gia, decided he would make helping his mother a full-time job. He took a leave of absence from Illumina, and he, Gia and their three young children moved from San Diego to Lexington, Ky.

“I have not been a particularly humble person,” Beth McDaniel said. “That humbled me.”

Dr. McDaniel’s parents had two homes in the Lexington area. One, on a horse farm, was vacant, and he appropriated a bedroom on the second floor for his office. He treated his work like a regular job, driving to the office each day from another house where he and his family were living. He dressed in his normal work clothes, slacks and a collared shirt. Meanwhile, his mother’s cancer was erupting.

“She was covered in tumors, almost like cobblestones,” said Dr. Fernando R. de Castro, her dermatologist. “They felt like marbles and pebbles all over her skin.” Large ones on her arms and legs had burst open. “We started talking about hospice .”

Mrs. McDaniel said she was not a vain person, but with red lumps all over her face, she was embarrassed to go out. She slept on a cooling pad and carried one with her to relieve the constant itching.

Every evening around 5:30 when the itching became most unbearable, she would lay her head in her husband’s lap as they watched TV in their great room and he would gently tickle her back for hours on end — trying to ease her discomfort.

The disease continued a relentless course until finally, accepting what seemed the inevitable, Mrs. McDaniel gave away her clothes, planned her funeral and wrote notes to a few people she thought she had offended in her life, asking them to forgive her.

“She believed, we all believed, she would die before we got the sequencing done,” Dr. McDaniel said.

Then, in January 2011, Dr. de Castro got a tissue sample from a tumor and, for comparison with normal cells, her saliva. He had removed a plug of tissue the size of a pencil eraser from one of the hundreds of tumors on Mrs. McDaniel’s skin, frozen it in liquid nitrogen and shipped it overnight to the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , Ariz. By April, scientists at Illumina and TGen, a nonprofit research institute, had completed the genetic sequencing of the samples.

Next came the hard part — the analysis. With time short, Dr. McDaniel worked on it himself and recruited two small biotechnology companies and TGen to help.

Three Billion Symbols in a Cell

John Carpten, an oncologist at TGen, and David Craig are accustomed to working with gene sequence data, but it is hard even for them to get used to the scale of such a project.

The hard drive containing Mrs. McDaniel’s genetic data arrived in the mail — it had too much data to send electronically. It took a full day just to pull this terabyte of information off the drive. Dr. Carpten explained that there were three billion symbols, made from four letters — A, T, G and C — in just one cell’s DNA. If those letters were printed on paper, they would fill a medium-sized elementary school’s library.

But there are unavoidable errors in sequencing, so to be sure the data is correct, researchers repeat the sequencing 30 times — 30 libraries’ worth. They do this for the normal cells, too — another 30 libraries’ worth. This kind of data, though, does not come in neat genetic words and sentences. Instead, Dr. Craig said, “It looks like it’s been through a shredder.”

“It is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle that has a billion pieces,” Dr. Carpten said.

Finally, they compared the sequences of normal cells and cancer cells. They found about 18,000 differences, most with no known significance for the disease.

At last, the work was done, and on May 18, Dr. McDaniel flew to TGen. The researchers noticed an intriguing aberration in Mrs. McDaniel’s cancer genes. But they were uncertain what it meant.

It looked as if two genes had fused to each other in Mrs. McDaniel’s cancer cells. The result was that the cell growth signals in the cancer cells were reversed, like crossed wires. The research team theorized that every time those cancer cells, T cells of her immune system, got a signal to stop growing, they reacted as though they had gotten a signal to grow. And every time they got a signal to grow, they responded by stopping their growth.

If they were right, the way to stop her cancer’s growth could be to signal it to grow. And that was what a new melanoma drug — ipilimumab, its trade name Yervoy — was designed to do. It spurred the growth of normal T cells.

But if the researchers were wrong, the drug could kill her.

They spent two hours at a whiteboard on Wednesday, May 18, trying to understand what the fusion really meant. Then Dr. McDaniel took the data home and asked a colleague at Illumina to try to fish out a handful of crucial genetic sequences that were buried among 50 million others. On Sunday night, May 22, Dr. McDaniel had them and began trying to decipher them. By 10 p.m., he had it figured out. The TGen scientists’ findings were real.

“The brake pedal had been wired to the accelerator,” Dr. McDaniel said.

He worked all night, found a paper by scientists who had deliberately fused those very genes and discovered that, yes, the genetically altered T cells had their growth signals reversed.

At 5:45 a.m. Dr. McDaniel sent an e-mail to his collaborators.

“I was so tired at that point that, believe it or not, I had forgotten about the drug,” he said.

He fell asleep and woke at 11 a.m., rushing back to his computer. The melanoma drug he had forgotten in his exhaustion should hit that target. And that could stop his mother’s cancer from growing. “My jaw was just hanging open,” Dr. McDaniel said. “The implications were so tantalizing that I didn’t dare believe them.”

A Remarkable Turnaround

Mrs. McDaniel had her first infusion on July 28, and the result seemed remarkable. Her oncologist, Dr. Gohmann, was overwhelmed. Her son, who had been terrified that he and the doctors might have made a terrible mistake, was overjoyed.

Mrs. McDaniel, who had not left her house for several months except to see her doctors, began going to movies and restaurants every day.

On Sept. 2, she and her husband went to the Heirloom Restaurant, in the middle of horse country, to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.

She had given away so many of her clothes when she thought she was dying that she puzzled over what to wear. She had a favorite blouse that was loosefitting and comfortable, but Mr. McDaniel recalled, “It was long gone.” She could not drink wine with the medicines she was taking, so she and her husband sipped iced tea in the quiet dining room.

“We reminisced, but also talked about the future as we hoped it would be,” Mr. McDaniel said.

But the reprieve lasted only weeks. By the end of September, the cancer was back.

Dr. McDaniel did not want to give up. Mrs. McDaniel’s tumor was sequenced again, looking for a new mutation, but there was nothing striking. As Dr. McDaniel sifted through the data, he called his parents every day. They began calling him the governor, hoping he would bring his mother another stay of execution.

The doctors considered a less appealing target, a mutated gene that T cells use to stop growing. Unpublished studies in mice suggested that a kidney cancer drug might stop the growth of T cells with this mutation.

By then, Mrs. McDaniel’s body was ravaged by the cancer and her treatments. She had entered hospice care, with a hospital bed in her home and a nurse and an assistant to help.

“We had this shaky evidence, based on the genome and on unpublished data,” Dr. McDaniel said.

But the drug’s side effects were mild, and her family and doctors decided she should try it.

“If we do nothing, she will be dead in one to six weeks,” Dr. McDaniel explained.

Mrs. McDaniel took the drug on Nov. 26. But she was so ill that she was unable to get out of bed, unable to drink from a straw. Her son Tim took his children to her bedroom one at a time so they could say goodbye.

“She wasn’t talking, but her eyes were open, and she acknowledged each one with a weak chuckle,” Dr. McDaniel said.

Three days later, she briefly rallied. Her husband held her hand.

“She said, ‘I love you,’ ” Mr. McDaniel said. “She then repeated it twice more. I kissed her forehead and told her that I loved her. Those were our last words to each other.”

The next morning, Nov. 30, Mr. McDaniel woke early and went to his wife’s room. Her breathing had become erratic. Worried, he stepped out and asked the hospice nurse to call the doctor. “In the seconds that I was absent, she died,” Mr. McDaniel said.

The team that tried to save her was heartbroken too, and was left with a long list of what-ifs. “If you really look at it, what did we buy her?” Dr. de Castro asked. Mrs. McDaniel was dying last January. Yet would she have survived as long even without the sequencing or the drugs? Did the team make a difference?

“I hope we did,” Dr. de Castro said, “but it’s hard to know.”.

story_reviews_00846,"Bathing-suit season is here and with it, anxiety over cellulite. A new laser device that burrows under the skin is getting praise from some doctors who say it gives more dramatic and longer-lasting results than previous treatments, but others caution that more research is needed.

Cellulite is a dimpled, uneven appearance of skin caused by fat underneath. It affects some 85% of women and about 5% of men. Until recently, the main treatments to battle cellulite have been external treatments such as creams and radio-frequency and massage devices. The creams are largely ineffective and the devices have a modest effect that typically lasts about six months, doctors say.

Aches & Claims looks at a new laser that burrows under the skin to treat cellulite. Cellulaze cuts fibers under the skin believed to be part of a major cause of the ugly dimpling phenonenom that affects 85% of women. Leslie Yazel has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Cynosure.

A therapy called Cellulaze, which uses a laser machine sold by Cynosure Inc. in Westford, Mass., hit the U.S. market in February. Some doctors say the results are impressive. ""The results are nothing short of remarkable,"" says Los Angeles plastic surgeon Grant Stevens, a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles. Dr. Stevens, who isn't affiliated with Cynosure, said he and another doctor in his practice together have treated about 40 patients with Cellulaze.

The Cellulaze laser machine Cynosure

Based on the published scientific data, Cellulaze is ""promising,"" says Mathew M. Avram, director of the Dermatology Laser & Cosmetic Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. But ""we need more clinical experience before we can make any definitive statements as to the efficacy of the device.""

Cellulaze is different from earlier treatments in that it tackles the root causes of cellulite, including thinning skin and connective fibers called septae that are believed to create tension by pulling down the skin, contributing to an uneven appearance, says Gordon H. Sasaki, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at Loma Linda University Medical University Center in Loma Linda, Calif. Dr. Sasaki is a paid consultant to Cynosure.

How Cellulaze Works: • Tiny incisions are made so a cannula, or tube, can be inserted into the skin. • Local anesthetic is inserted through the cannula. • Laser light through the cannula cuts septae—which scientists say help cause cellulite dimples. The underside of the skin is heated and some small amounts of fat are melted. • Bruises and tiny scars result, but fade with time. • Compression garments recommended to prevent fluid buildup.

Cellulaze is done by plastic surgeons in their offices under local anesthetic. It typically costs $5,000 to $7,000 for a bilateral area, such as the thighs, and another $2,500 or more for each additional area. One or more tiny incisions are made so a narrow tube called a cannula can be inserted into the skin. Laser light, delivered through the cannula, cuts the septae and melts small amounts of fat, Dr. Sasaki says. It heats the underside of the skin, which stimulates collagen production and makes skin thicker and more elastic, he adds.

Cellulaze leaves tiny scars—about two millimeters long—which fade with time, surgeons say. Typically, compression garments are recommended for at least two or three weeks to prevent fluid buildup. And there will be bruises, so patients typically need to wait three to six weeks before venturing out in a bathing suit, surgeons say.

The procedure can cause a buildup of fluid in the area that has been treated, which can last for months and needs to be drained regularly by a doctor.

In a written statement, Cynosure says ""a few"" patients in early trials had the buildups, called seromas, adding that they need to be drained to prevent infections and other complications. The company says it has since lowered the recommended laser dosage and it isn't aware of any seromas since the device hit the U.S. market.

According to a company-funded study of 10 women published last year in Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Cellulaze resulted in skin that was 25% thicker after a year. Cellulite reduction was ""good"" to ""excellent"" as graded by physicians.

Dr. Sasaki, in data obtained as part of a company-financed trial that has yet to be published, says 80% of 25 patients he treated are still enjoying ""substantial improvement"" two years after the surgery.

Lawrence Bass, director of the minimally invasive plastic-surgery program at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York, says the procedure appears to reduce the depth of cellulite dimples. A person with less-pronounced dimples is ""most likely to get a home run"" out of the procedure, says Dr. Bass, who has attended scientific presentations of the data but hasn't performed the procedure. But if you have really deep ones, he adds, ""it might not be enough to make the lifestyle change you want to make, such as wearing shorts in the summertime.""

The cannula Cynosure

If a deep dimple is still visible, fat can be injected with a syringe later to even it out, Dr. Sasaki says.

Another new laser treatment both for cellulite and body contouring is i-Lipo, i-Lipo, from Chromogenex Technologies Ltd., South Wales, England. The laser, which hit the U.S. market in December, is noninvasive and involves pads placed externally on the skin. I-Lipo provokes a chemical reaction that breaks down fat into its components, says company clinical manager Donna Freeman. After the treatment, a cardiovascular workout of 30 to 40 minutes is recommended to burn off the components.

The ""Ultra"" model of the device comes with a vacuum-massage device aimed at smoothing cellulite, but the effects on cellulite haven't yet been tested in a clinical trial, the company says. A 34-patient study, unpublished, found eight 20-minute sessions with the device reduced midsection size by 1.8 inches, measured by a tape measure, compared with only a third of an inch for a sham therapy, which looked the same to patients.

Dr. Bass says he is ""skeptical"" because measuring-tape data has a large margin of error. Chromogenex says the measurements used scientifically accepted standards.

story_reviews_00848,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Botox injections may provide some relief from arm tremors caused by multiple sclerosis, according to a small study published Monday. Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it’s best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox.

Botox gained fame for smoothing aging skin — by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin — but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms.

The new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability.

Right now, there’s no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it’s risky and may not even have lasting benefits.

“Exploring new treatments is important, and it’s heartening to see there’s some promise here,” LaRocca said of the current findings. But there’s still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview.

“This study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,” LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said.

The study’s lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. “There are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,” Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email.

One is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months.

In real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks.

Muscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself.

The study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo.

On average, the patients’ tremor “scores” had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment — which essentially means moving from “moderate” to “mild,” LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12.

In contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections.

Larger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections — since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle.

“So practitioners will have to be up to speed,” LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment.

According to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site.

Botox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company. The study itself was funded by the Box Hill MS Research Fund and the Royal Melbourne Hospital.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, July 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Men may one day have a birth-control option other than the condom or vasectomy -- if early research on a new contraceptive gel pans out.

Preliminary findings suggest that when applied to the skin, the gel dramatically lowers sperm counts, thus also lowering -- though not eliminating -- the risk for pregnancy.

This is the first time that a combination of testosterone and a synthetic progestin called Nestorone has been tested as a gel that could be applied topically. Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.

The combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.

Although men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.

""I think [men] would use it more than is realized,"" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. ""Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.""

Unfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.

The results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.

According to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.

The study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a ""placebo"" gel with no progestin.

Up to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.

Normal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.

Up to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.

The testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.

One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.

The answer, said Wang, is ""We just don't know.""

That's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.

A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.

Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.

In addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.

Because the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00850,"THURSDAY, June 28, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new drug for type 2 diabetes causes significantly less weight gain and may carry lower risks for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), heart attack and stroke than standard medications, a new study indicates.

Researchers in Germany noted that the new drug, linagliptin (Tradjenta), is intended for use in patients that do not fare well with metformin, the most common first-line drug used to treat the disease.

Patients with type 2 diabetes may stop responding to metformin over time. Others who do not respond to metformin alone are given a second drug to help them maintain normal blood sugar levels. The researchers noted that which drug they should be prescribed is unclear.

The researchers pointed out that most patients are prescribed a class of drugs called sulphonylureas to supplement metformin. However, these drugs can sometimes lead to hypoglycemia and weight gain, which increases the patients' risk for heart attack and stroke.

To compare the effects of linagliptin to glimepiride (the most commonly used sulphonylurea), the researchers conducted a double-blind study over the course of two years. The study, which was funded by linagliptin's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, involved 1,500 people from 16 countries with type 2 diabetes. None of the patients had responded to metformin alone.

Although the effectiveness of the drugs were similar, the study showed the side effects of linagliptin were much less severe than those of glimepiride. The researchers found that 7 percent of patients on linagliptin experienced hypoglycemia, compared to 38 percent of patients treated with glimepiride.

The patients on linagliptin also had fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those being treated with glimepiride.

The researchers argued that since linagliptin allows the body to increase the amount of insulin it produces in a glucose-dependent way, the risk for hypoglycemia may be significantly lower.

And since hypoglycemia ""can have substantial negative clinical consequences"" in terms of risk for death, illness, mental function and poor quality of life, preventing it is crucial, study co-author Baptist Gallwitz, of Tubingen University Hospital, said in a news release.

The study authors pointed out linagliptin was licensed in 2011 and this is the first long-term study examining its safety and effectiveness. They added more research is needed to confirm their findings.

One expert said patients and doctors may still have to balance the superiority of linagliptin against its higher cost in comparison to older drugs.

The new study provides more evidence that drugs like linagliptin ""are just as good as the old standby sulfonylurea therapies, with the added benefits of inducing fewer hypoglycemic events, causing less weight gain, along with a likely decrease in cardiovascular events,"" said Dr. Stuart Weiss, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center and clinical assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, New York City.

But millions of Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes, so ""cost issues favoring sulfonylureas may be the only reason for preferring continued sulfonylurea use,"" he added. The results of a larger, ongoing study currently underway may help resolve the issue of whether the newer drug is worth the extra money, Weiss said.

The study was published online June 27 in The Lancet.

story_reviews_00851,"A diet based on healthy carbohydrates—rather than a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet—offers the best chance of keeping weight off without bringing unwanted side effects, a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests.

Study participants following a low-glycemic-index diet, which is similar to a Mediterranean diet and focuses on fish, fruit, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, also saw improved cholesterol levels and other important markers that lower the risks of developing heart disease and diabetes. Such a diet might include minimally processed oatmeal, almonds, brown rice, beans and healthy fats like olive oil, among other foods.

The study was led by researchers at the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital and funded by the National Institutes of Health and the New Balance Foundation, which is affiliated with the athletic-shoe maker. It was designed to assess how each of three common diets affects the ability to keep weight off. Participants had all of their food prepared for them, and their food intake was monitored. They ate many meals at the hospital, picking up others to eat at home.

Study participants following a low-glycemic index diet, which is similar to Mediterranean diet and focuses on fruit, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, also saw improved cholesterol levels. Reuters

David Ludwig, one of the study's authors and the director of the center, explained that most people struggle to keep weight off. Previous studies have shown that weight loss reduces the body's daily energy expenditure—or how many calories the body burns through activity and just by resting—making it easy to regain weight. Dr. Ludwig's study was designed to look at the impact of the three diets on measures of energy expenditure, in addition to assessing hormones, fat levels in the blood and other health markers.

The study's 21 participants, 18 to 40 years old, initially lost 10% to 15% of their body weight during a three-month diet that contained about 45% of total calories from carbohydrates, 30% from fat and 25% from protein.

A month later, participants were placed on one of three diets for a month: a low-fat diet limiting fats to 20% of total calories; a low-carbohydrate diet modeled on the Atkins diet, limiting carbohydrate intake to 10% of total calories; and a low-glycemic-index diet, which contained 40% of total calories from carbohydrates, 40% from fats and 20% from protein. Participants were then switched to the other two diets during two additional four-week periods.

""The low-fat diet had the worst effect"" on energy expenditure, Dr. Ludwig said. Participants on that diet also had increases in triglycerides, a type of fat, and lower levels of so-called good cholesterol. ""We should avoid severely restricting any major nutrient and focus on the quality of the nutrient,"" he said.

Dr. Ludwig said those on the low-carb diet had the biggest boost in total energy expenditure, burning about 300 calories more per day than those on the low-fat diet—about the same as an hour of moderate exercise. But that bump came at a cost: increases in cortisol, a stress hormone, and a measure of inflammation called CRP, which can raise the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.

Those on the low-glycemic-index diet burned about 150 calories a day more than those on the low-fat diet without any negative impacts on cholesterol levels or various hormones, making it the ideal diet, Dr. Ludwig said. The glycemic index measures the impact of carbohydrates on blood-sugar levels.

A second study in the same medical journal showed that people in an 18-month weight-loss program that started with monthly meetings lost nearly as much weight as those in a much costlier program of the same duration with group sessions that initially met weekly. That study, led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, found that the monthly program cut about $600 off the cost of a $1,360 traditional weight-loss program with the weekly classes.Members of the group taking monthly classes were mailed the same material as those who attended classes weekly, and those who failed to meet weight-loss goals could get individual counseling by phone or in person.

story_reviews_00852,"A new study is raising questions about the age-old belief that a calorie is a calorie.

The research finds that dieters who were trying to maintain their weight loss burned significantly more calories eating a low-carb diet than they did eating a low-fat diet.

But some experts say these findings are very preliminary.

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, was designed to see if changing the type of diet people consumed helped with weight maintenance because dieters often regain lost weight.

So scientists had 21 obese participants, ages 18 to 40, lose 10% to 15% of their initial body weight (about 30 pounds). After their weight had stabilized, each participant followed one of three different diets for four weeks. Participants were fed food that was prepared for them by diet experts. The dieters were admitted to the hospital four times for medical and metabolic testing.

Here’s a look at the three types of diets used in the new study: A low-fat diet, which is about 20% of calories from fat, 60% from carbohydrates, 20% from protein. It emphasizes whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables and cuts way back on oils, nuts, fatty meats and other high-fat foods. A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates, 30% from protein, 60% from fat. This diet emphasizes beef, fish, chicken, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while slashing the consumption of breads, pasta, potatoes, rice, cakes, cookies and starchy vegetables. A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, is made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). It gets about 40% of daily calories from carbohydrates, 40% from fat and 20% from protein. Source: Journal of the American Medical Association

The diets had the same number of calories, but the fat, protein and carbohydrate content varied. Those diets:

•A low-fat diet which was about 20% of calories from fat and emphasized whole-grain products and fruits and vegetables.

•A low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet, with only 10% of calories from carbohydrates. It emphasized fish, chicken, beef, eggs, cheese, some vegetables and fruits while eliminating foods such as breads, pasta, potatoes and starchy vegetables.

•A low-glycemic index diet, similar to a Mediterranean diet, made up of vegetables, fruit, beans, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and mostly healthy grains (old-fashioned oats, brown rice). These foods digest more slowly, helping to keep blood sugar and hormones stable after the meal.

Findings, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association: Participants burned about 300 calories more a day on a low-carb diet than they did on a low-fat diet. ""That's the amount you'd burn off in an hour of moderate intensity physical activity without lifting a finger,"" says senior author David Ludwig, director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital.

""Participants burned 150 calories more on the low-glycemic index diet than the low-fat diet. That's about an hour of light physical activity,"" he says.

The reason for the low-carb advantage is unclear, he says.

""We think the low-carb and low-glycemic index diets, by not causing the surge and crash in blood sugar, don't trigger the starvation response. When the body thinks it's starving, it turns down metabolism to conserve energy,"" he says.

The authors note a downside to the low-carb diet: It appears to raise some risk factors for heart disease.

Ludwig says that restricting carbohydrates over the long term may be hard for many people. If you're trying to lose weight, ""you can get a jump start with a low-carb diet, but over the long term, a low-glycemic index diet may be better than severely restricting carbohydrates.""

""The low-glycemic index diet seems to be the happy medium,"" says Cara Ebbeling, associate director of the Obesity Prevention Center. ""It didn't slow metabolism as much as the low-fat diet, and it didn't seem to have some of the negative effects on cardiovascular disease risk.""

On a low-glycemic index diet, you would avoid highly processed carbs such as white bread, white rice, many snack foods, prepared breakfast cereals, sugary desserts and sugary beverages, she says.

Experts had different responses to the findings.

George Bray, an obesity researcher at Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge who has also studied this topic and who wrote the accompanying editorial in JAMA, says that other studies ""show that you can do well on any diet as long as you stick to it. Adherence is the major key for weight loss and maintenance. There is no magic in any diet.""

Eric Westman, a Duke University researcher who has conducted several studies on the low-carb diet and is co-author of The New Atkins for a New You, says this study documents that the ""lower the carbohydrates, the better the metabolic effects. People burn more calories if they eat fewer carbohydrates.""

Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University, says longer studies conducted among people in their own environments, not with such controlled meals, have shown ""little difference in weight loss and maintenance between one kind of diet and another.""

TUESDAY, June 26, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that shows the electrical activity of the brain, might be used to spot autism in children, a new study suggests.

The study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University Medical School, looked at the synchronization of brain activity across different brain regions, as measured by EEG.

""These scientists used sensors to record electrical brain activity across many different regions on the scalp,"" explained Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer at the advocacy group Autism Speaks. ""They then looked at the extent to which brain activity from one region was synchronized with brain activity from another region,"" a phenomenon known as ""EEG coherence,"" said Dawson, who was not involved in the research.

""Synchronization between different brain regions indicates that those regions are functioning in a coordinated, rather than independent, fashion -- in other words, they are functionally connected and communicating with each other,"" she said.

In the new study, Dr. Frank Duffy and Dr. Heidelise Als compared EEG measurements of nearly 1,000 children with and without autism. They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.

EEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.

The children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.

The research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.

The use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.

""What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,"" Dawson noted. ""Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.""

She said the findings are important because, ""they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.""

Language, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.

""This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,"" she added. ""The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.""

Another expert agreed.

""Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,"" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.

The number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.

story_reviews_00854,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A seaweed-based fiber supplement, taken daily before meals, helped people lose weight in a new study.

But that was only the case among people who stuck with the diet study over a few months. More than one-fifth of people dropped out when they couldn’t tolerate the supplement’s taste, texture and side effects.

Researchers have explored the potential of seaweed as an appetite suppressant, but so far products haven’t panned out.

“There have been problems in the past to develop something (that tastes) acceptable,” said Dr. Arne Astrup, one of the study’s authors from the University of Copenhagen and a member of the advisory board to S-Biotek, a Danish company that provided funding for the study.

Previous seaweed-based supplements were slimy and caused bloating, and they also had a fishy taste. The new supplement used in this study is less unpleasant — but there’s still room for improvement, said Astrup.

The supplement is based on the seaweed extract alginate, a thickening agent and a common ingredient in foods like soups and jellies. It’s also increasingly used by the weight-loss industry, marketed as an appetite suppressant.

Packaged in powder form and mixed with liquid, alginate expands in the stomach to form a thick gel, mimicking the effect of a large meal.

“This gel is really like a pudding that will last in the stomach for hours, gradually degrading and disappearing,” Astrup said.

For the study, the researchers randomly divided 96 generally healthy but obese people, aged 20 to 55, into two groups.

One group was given packets of the gel supplement, containing 15 grams of fiber, and the other got a seaweed-free placebo drink. Neither the researchers nor the participants knew who was receiving the seaweed supplement.

In terms of calories, flavor and appearance, the placebo and treatment drink were identical.

For three months, study participants drank the supplements, dissolved in two cups of water, 30 minutes before each meal. They were also told to cut back on calories. By the end of the trial, sixteen people had dropped out of the study, including 10 out of 48 from the seaweed group, according to findings published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Among people who stuck with the trial, those on the fiber supplement lost 15 pounds, on average, compared to 11 pounds in the placebo group. But when all 96 original participants were included in the analysis, the researchers found no significant difference in weight loss between the two treatment groups.

TREAT FINDINGS ‘WITH CAUTION’

Previous studies have shown eating a high-fiber diet can help reduce the hunger pangs that may lead to over-eating and derail a healthy diet plan.

Still, the new results should be treated with caution, according to Dr. Maria Vazquez Roque, who has worked on alginate-based gels at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, but was not involved in the study. Just looking at the effect of the supplement on people who finished the treatment can bias the findings, she said.

For Mette Kristensen, one of the study’s authors, the message seems clear: “If you actually comply with the treatment, you do have the improvement in weight loss.”

However, effects on blood pressure were less promising. Systolic blood pressure — the top number on a blood pressure reading — fell by almost six points on average in the placebo group over the 12-week study, but by just over one point in the treatment group. At times during the trials, systolic blood pressure increased in the alginate group by one to two points.

According to the researchers, the higher sodium content of the alginate drink — a little over one gram per dose, or about half a teaspoon of salt — could have offset any potential blood-pressure reducing effect of the supplement. The American Heart Association recommends that adults eat less than 1.5 g of sodium per day.

Questions remain about the safety of the fiber supplement over the long term. Five people taking the fiber gel left the study due to problems with stomach bloating, nausea and diarrhea. Two people taking a placebo supplement, which didn’t contain the seaweed fiber, experienced similar problems.

There are many different types of alginate, said Richard Mattes, who has studied the effect of alginate fiber on appetite at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana — so the trick is to find the right alginate in the right dose.

And just feeling less hungry due to a supplement won’t make you lose weight unless you eat fewer calories, said Mattes, who was not involved in the new study.

The research group is working on a new supplement that uses 80 percent less alginate, with less sodium, better taste and fewer side effects than the current formula, Astrup told Reuters Health.

Alginate as an aid to weight loss is already commercially available in pill form and costs around $45 for a seven-day supply. These supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, said Vazquez Roque.

story_reviews_00855,"If you're one of the estimated 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, you're probably all too familiar with the feeling of aching, swollen, or stiff knees.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may relieve those painful symptoms in most patients. But for others, doctors may prescribe a more invasive treatment that involves injecting hyaluronic acid in to the knee, called viscosupplementation.

Now, a new report questions the efficacy of this treatment for osteoarthritis in the knee.

Hyaluronic acid is a lubricating fluid that is naturally found in the knee, but degenerates over time in people with osteoarthritis. The effect of the injection used in viscosupplementation is to stimulate cells in the knee to increase production of hyaluronic acid.



In a meta-analysis of 177 reports that included data on more than 12,000 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee, researchers at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland concluded that the treatment ""has minimal benefits and potential for harm.""

They write that ""because of increased risks for serious adverse events and local adverse events, the administration of these preparations should be discouraged.""

Dr. John Richmond disagrees. He is the Chairman of the Orthopedics Department at New England Baptist Hospital and the previous Chair of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) working group on treatment of osteoarthritis in knees.

""We have an epidemic of osteoarthritis of the knee and we have limited treatment options,"" says Dr. Richmond, who was not affiliated with the analysis but who reviewed the same data it was based on. ""This needs to remain one of those limited treatment options and should be used appropriately by the physician giving it.""

The most common side effects patients undergoing viscosupplementation may endure are flare-ups - where the knee becomes hot and swollen within 24 hours after the injection - and effusions, where excessive joint fluid collects inside the knee. The researchers in Switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events.

Dr. Richmond, who has independently reviewed the same research when the AAOS was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, argues that despite infrequent instances of those side-effects, viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients.

""This is most effective in relatively younger patients, 40 to 50 to 60 year olds, and...in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease,"" says Richmond. ""This is not a first line treatment, but it's a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened.""

story_reviews_00856,"June 11, 2012 (Philadelphia) -- In an early study, an experimental stem cell procedure helped 15 teens with type 1 diabetes stay off of insulin injections for about 1.5 years, on average.

The study was very small, and the procedure is not ready for widespread use. ""We now have a unique approach with some positive findings, but it's still early. We need to better understand the biology behind the treatment and follow patients for long-term side effects,"" Robert E. Ratner, MD, chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, tells WebMD.

This is the latest of several stem cell studies to show promising results for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, Ratner notes.

In the new study, 15 of 28 teens with type 1 diabetes who got an experimental treatment using their own stem cells went into remission and did not need insulin injections for an average of about 1.5 years.

The ""cocktail treatment"" combines stem cell therapy with drugs that suppress the body's immune system. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells within the pancreas.

The experimental treatment is called autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It aims to kill the destructive immune system cells and replace them with immature stem cells not programmed to destroy insulin-producing cells.

First, patients are given drugs to stimulate production of blood stem cells. The blood stem cells are then removed from the body and frozen. Then, patients are hospitalized and given drugs to kill the destructive immune system cells. The harvested blood stem cells are then put back into the patient.

Eight teens who took part in the study have remained insulin-free for two years, on average. One patient has gone without insulin injections for 3.5 years.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Symptoms include serious memory loss, confusion, and mood changes that develop gradually and worsen with time.

The new study included 124 people aged 65 to 88 who had mild cognitive impairment, which is the medical term for mild memory loss. About 15% of people with MCI develop full-blown Alzheimer's disease each year.

In the study, blood levels of caffeine were more than 50% lower among people with MCI who developed Alzheimer's during follow-up, when compared with their counterparts who did not worsen. Coffee was the main, or only source, of caffeine among people in the study.

No one with mild memory loss who later developed Alzheimer's had initial blood caffeine levels above 1,200 ng/ml. This is equivalent to drinking several cups of coffee a few hours before giving blood. People whose memory loss did not progress all had blood caffeine levels higher than this level, the study shows.

""Continue to drink coffee,"" says researcher Chuanhai Cao, PhD. He is a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida's College of Pharmacy and Byrd Alzheimer's Institute in Tampa. ""There is no reason to stop if you are experiencing memory problems.""

TUESDAY, June 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A simple blood test may help gauge prognosis and tailor treatments for women who have been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer.

The test, described in the June 6 online edition of The Lancet Oncology, measures how many tumor cells are circulating in the blood. In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying.

""This may help with prognosis and staging of the cancer and, in the future, with targets for breast cancer treatments,"" said study lead author Dr. Anthony Lucci, a professor of surgery at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.

Commenting on the findings, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We are moving into a state where we're looking at a person's individual tumor and this is another way to do that, potentially leading to treatment.""

Whether or not cancer has spread to the lymph nodes is currently the best way to predict survival in women with breast cancer. Even so, a substantial number of patients whose cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes will have a recurrence while some of those who do have lymph-node involvement won't relapse.

Blood tests similar to the one investigated in this study have been found to be useful to gauge how well patients who already have metastatic cancer will do.

For this study, researchers counted circulating tumor cells in 302 breast cancer patients who were about to undergo surgery but who hadn't yet received chemotherapy.

Circulating tumor cells were detectable in about one-quarter of the participants, the investigators found. Fifteen percent of these individuals had a relapse and 10 percent died during a five-year follow-up, compared with 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of patients who did not have circulating tumor cells.

The more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report.

Although the test may not be far off in terms of clinical practice, ""we need additional studies,"" Lucci said.

One area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy.

Currently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend that clinicians measure circulating tumor cells in patients.

And in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that ""despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain.""

According to Bernik, though, ""it makes sense that women who have circulating tumor cells would potentially be at higher risk of distant disease at some later date.""

The problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.

""The cells also need to have a propensity to grow elsewhere,"" she said. ""Not every cancer cell becomes a metastatic cancer cell. Hopefully, gaining the ability to tell which cells are more likely to spread potentially could guide therapy,"" Bernik added.

According to Lucci, circulating tumor cells are also showing promise in predicting melanoma prognosis, so the method may be ""effective in several different tumor systems.""

story_reviews_00859,"“Many of us theorize that the two are tied — inflammation causes seizures, and seizures cause inflammation,” said Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at the New York University Langone Medical Center and William’s doctor. “Over time, both of them may feed off each other.”

About 50 million people worldwide, including more than 2.7 million people in the United States, are struggling with epilepsy in some form. Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.

An epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It’s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system’s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.

Scientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen’s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy — the surgical removal of one of the brain’s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.

Eleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.

The amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. “This is a novel finding,” Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. “It was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.”

Normal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells’ capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become “distracted” by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Now Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.

Sixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.

The drug is now the subject of a Phase 2 trial involving 400 patients. “Anti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,” said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.

Replacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy’s underlying causes. “Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,” Dr. French said.

But there are dangers to this approach. Steroids — potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments — can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.

“Like any new field, there’s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,” said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. “The challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.”

Still, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son. At William’s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.

Dr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.

“I was taking his life into my hands, I know,” she said. “But the way I looked at it, he was going to die anyway.”

Since that night William has not had another seizure. He continues with the steroids and also follows the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen that has proved beneficial for many with intractable epilepsy.

An aspirin a day could keep skin cancer away, according to a new report in the journal Cancer.

Researchers in Denmark and the U.S. found that people taking common painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen were less likely to develop skin cancer — including squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma — especially when they took the drugs for at least seven years or used them at least twice a week. It’s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers — a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.

In the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients’ histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.

(MORE: Will an Aspirin Prolong Your Life? It Depends)

Overall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.

The longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn’t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.

The drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors’ ability to expand and develop blood supplies.

“Given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,” the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.

(MORE: Aspirin, a Wonder Drug? Studies Show It May Prevent Cancer)

In the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn’t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)

But given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs’ anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. “We hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,” Johannesdottir said in a statement. “Also, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.”

TUESDAY, May 29, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) -- which include medicine cabinet staples such as aspirin, Motrin and Aleve -- appears to significantly lower the risk for developing several major forms of skin cancer, a new Danish study reveals.

What's more, the apparent protective impact of both prescription and nonprescription NSAIDs on skin cancer risk seems to be stronger the longer someone takes them.

Over-the-counter NSAIDs are used to control pain, fever and swelling. NSAIDs also include prescription medicines called COX-2 enzyme inhibitors, such as Celebrex (celecoxib).

""Our study showed that users of common painkillers, known as NSAIDs, have a lower risk of the three major types of skin cancer, [including] malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,"" said study lead author, Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir, at the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.

""The greatest effect,"" she noted, ""was found for squamous cell carcinomas and malignant melanoma, especially when [these painkillers were] taken frequently and over a long time period.""

The study appears in the May 29 online issue of the journal Cancer.

The authors noted that prior work supported the notion that NSAIDs may offer some measure of protection against cancer (most notably colorectal cancer), by specifically impeding the cancer-causing activities of COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) enzymes.

However, the team suggested that past investigations into how NSAIDs may affect skin cancer risk, in particular, had key design problems that undercut efforts to nail down any NSAID-skin cancer connection.

For the new study, the researchers analyzed prescription databases and health information registries including the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Civil Registration System.

The team focused on diagnostic and death records concerning nearly 2,000 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, about 13,300 cases of basal cell carcinoma and nearly 3,250 cases of malignant melanoma diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 when the patients were at least 20 years old.

In turn, prescription histories were gathered for both the cancer patient group and almost 179,000 healthy Danes. Records covered the use of both low- and high-dose aspirin (ranging from 75 milligrams to 500 milligrams), so-called ""nonselective"" NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen [Advil] and naproxen [Aleve]), and both older and newer types of COX-2 inhibitors. Researchers noted the number of prescriptions issued per patient and their length of use, with short-term use defined as fewer than seven years.

The result: The relative risk for squamous cell carcinoma was found to have dropped by 15 percent among those Danes who had filled more than two NSAID prescriptions, compared to those who had filled two or less.

Similarly, malignant melanoma risk fell by nearly as much (13 percent) among those filling more than two NSAID prescriptions.

However, the same dynamic was generally not seen with regards to basal cell carcinoma. But taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, and at relatively high doses, was associated with a reduced risk (between 15 and 21 percent), specifically for basal cell cases that manifested in skin regions that typically experience relatively little sun exposure (areas other than the neck or head).

On that front, long-term users and those who took NSAIDs at relatively higher doses appeared to benefit from the strongest protective effect, suggesting that when it comes to skin cancer risk reduction, more NSAID use is better.

The researchers pointed out that the NSAID-cancer connection could be affected by a range of lifestyle factors they did not account for, such as an individual's specific skin type or sun exposure patterns.

But Johannesdottir added that ""we hope that our finding will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention. Also, the potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use,"" she noted.

However, ""other studies need to detail the association further and to examine benefits versus risks,"" she cautioned. ""Meanwhile, the most important prevention against skin cancer remains sun protection.""

Meanwhile, Dr. William Ting, a private practice dermatologist in San Ramon, Calif., praised the study despite agreeing that many factors are at play when it comes to skin cancer formation.

""Now we have a better understanding that inflammation also plays a significant role in cancer formation and even skin cancers,"" he said.

And, ""this exciting article gives physicians and consumers a relatively simple way of diminishing one's risk of skin cancer by doing what most of us are doing already for heart health,"" Ting added. Ting also advised that people consult with their doctor before starting on any blood thinner.

While the study found an association between skin cancer risk and NSAIDs, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.

There are an estimated three million unplanned pregnancies a year in the U.S., often because of incorrect or inconsistent use of contraception, and about 1.2 million abortions, according to research cited with the study.

The Contraceptive Choice project is being run by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The study was funded by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, a charity of Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The study found that long-acting contraception is about 20 times more effective at preventing pregnancy than pills, patches or vaginal rings because those methods ""wipe out the human error factor,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Peipert, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University. ""IUDs and implants are more effective because women can forget about them after clinicians put the devices in place.""

Failure rates for such methods are less than 1% but they require an office procedure and can cost patients several hundred dollars if not paid for by insurance, doctors said.

Hormonal implants are inserted under the skin of the upper arm and are effective for three years. IUDs are inserted into the uterus and last five or 10 years, depending on the type. IUDs and implants can be removed if women want to try to become pregnant. Dr. Peipert said fertility returns immediately in most women.

Birth control pills are the most commonly used contraceptive in the U.S., but women need to take the pills daily for them to be fully effective. Other studies have shown that many women—especially teenagers—miss two or more pills per menstrual cycle, which cuts the effectiveness at preventing pregnancy. The study also included a hormone-based shot that can be given to women every three months to prevent pregnancy.

The study showed pregnancy—or failure rates—among participants who used the pill, patch, or ring were 4.8%, 7.8% and 9.4% in years one, two and three of the study respectively, while the failure rates in those using IUDs or implants were all below 1% during the same period. Failure rates for women receiving the three-month hormone shot also were less than 1%.

Dr. Peipert said he hopes the results prompt more women and doctors who counsel women on birth control to consider IUDs and implants because it could greatly reduce unintended pregnancies. ""If there were a drug for cancer, heart disease or diabetes that was 20 times more effective we would recommend it first,"" he said.

Dr. Erika Banks, director of gynecology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., said, ""For a woman who wants to get pregnant in a short period of time, it may not be worth the cost of having a long-acting method placed."" Dr. Banks, who wasn't involved in the study, added that some insurance plans will only cover pills, patches or vaginal rings.

Still, she said, the long-acting methods can be an ""excellent"" option for young women who don't want to become pregnant for several years.

Dr. Peipert trains doctors on how to implant a contraceptive device made by Merck & Co. and Washington University receives fees from the company, according to the New England Journal of Medicine article.

The Contraceptive Choice study involves women who were between ages 14 and 45 who initially weren't using contraception or wanted to switch birth-control methods, from August 2007 through last September. The women also said they didn't want to become pregnant for the next 12 months.

story_reviews_00865,"MONDAY, May 21, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- The new blood thinner Xarelto appears to lower the chances of potentially fatal blood clots in high-risk heart patients, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration review has found.

The review came in briefing documents that were filed Monday in advance of an FDA advisory panel meeting Wednesday, at which the panel is to vote on whether to recommend approval of Xarelto for treating people with acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions brought on by sudden reduced blood flow to the heart).

The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its expert panels, but the agency typically does. A final decision is expected by the end of June, according to the documents.

Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is one of a new class of blood thinners that have been developed to overcome some of the problems that exist with the standard treatment, warfarin (Coumadin), which requires constant dose monitoring. Warfarin's effectiveness also can be altered by certain foods and other medications. Xarelto already is approved for use by those with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and by people who are having hip- or knee-replacement surgery.

In the FDA briefing documents, an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death, even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding.

""However, what is not reflected in the sponsor's analysis are minor bleeding events,"" FDA reviewer Dr. Karen Hicks wrote in the briefing documents. ""While it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm, these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved.""

""While reductions in [cardiovascular] death still trump these bleeding events, if rivaroxaban is approved, we should expect a number of bleeding events that will require medical attention,"" Hicks wrote. ""Carefully selecting patients for rivaroxaban therapy will be necessary to mitigate these bleeding risks.""

In research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference in New Orleans last February, Australian doctors followed more than 14,000 people who took either Xarelto or warfarin for a median of two years. Of those patients, 136 had bleeding in the brain.

People who took Xarelto -- and suffered from the most common type of atrial fibrillation and didn't have heart valve damage -- were about one-third less likely to experience bleeding in the brain than those who took warfarin, the investigators found.

COPD is the umbrella term for chronic lung diseases, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is often marked by a chronic cough and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves the use of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators to open airways and make breathing easier.

In a new study of 68 people with COPD, some got acupuncture, along with their daily medication, for three months. Others got a sham acupuncture treatment, in which the needles did not enter their skin. Those who received acupuncture along with their daily medication for three months were able to walk longer without becoming breathless, compared to those who got the sham acupuncture treatment.

The study appears online in the Archives of Internal Medicine. People who received real acupuncture also showed improvements in their quality of life and ability to exercise, according to researchers from Kyoto University and Meiji University of Integrative Medicine in Kyoto, Japan.

Many people with COPD have problems getting optimal nutrition because of their condition. The study showed that acupuncture may improve stomach function, making it easier for people with COPD to eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight.",Acupuncture May Be Worth a Shot for COPD,2,WebMD
story_reviews_00868,"A new method for performing a “virtual” colonoscopy that requires less unpleasant preparation was shown in a new study to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps—and was a better experience for patients.

The second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. after lung cancer, colon cancer can be prevented if precancerous polyps—known as adenomas—are found and removed during a colonoscopy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone 50 or older were regularly screened, as many as 60% of deaths could be avoided.

But Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Health Blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation, which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative, is so unpleasant. In addition, some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure, or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel.

“No one should be dying from colon cancer, which is almost completely preventable with screening; and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it,” says Zalis, lead author of the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

In recent years, the use of computed tomographic colonography—known as CT or “virtual” colonoscopy—has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure. But though these virtual scans are performed externally, patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon.

So, the researchers developed a software program to electronically “cleanse” the bowel, Zalis says. Prior to a scan, researchers asked patients to adhere to a low-fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to “tag” the colon’s contents. After performing the CT scan, the software electronically identified polyps.

The researchers screened 605 patients with the laxative-free CT scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more. The laxative-free scan accurately identified 91% of patients with polyps of 10 mm or larger -- those at highest risk of becoming cancerous -- but was less accurate for smaller lesions, the study says.

Dr. James Aisenberg, a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, agrees that, for some people, the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening.

However, like virtual colonoscopy in general, laxative-free CTC “will miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal-cancer prevention,” says Dr. Aisenberg, who wasn’t involved with the study.

However, the laxative-free method “may become a useful alternative for persons who won't otherwise undergo screening, and is much better than no screening at all.”

Dr. Zalis and some of his co-investigators developed the software. The American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health and General Electric Co.’s health-care unit—which markets scanning devices and accessories—supported the researchers. Dr. Zalis says the company had no influence on the study.",New Method Easing Preparation May Encourage Colon Checks,3,Cancer
story_reviews_00869,"A new method of performing virtual colonoscopy using a CT scan -- which doesn’t involve the dreaded laxative preparation to clear the colon the night before -- may be about as effective as a standard colonoscopy at identifying the large polyps most likely to become cancerous, according to research conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and elsewhere.

If the finding is confirmed by larger studies, the technique could eventually serve as a first-line screening tool for colon cancer, especially for the many people who avoid screening altogether.

The new technique works by using a contrast agent -- a tiny amount of this dye is ingested two days before the test -- to highlight fecal matter in the colon, which can then be digitally erased from the scan using a computer software program, making it easier to see polyps.

In the study of 605 patients, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the prep-free virtual colonoscopy was able to identify more than 90 percent of suspicious polyps that were 10 millimeters or larger, compared with 95 percent identified when the same patients later had a standard colonoscopy.

The research was partially funded by GE Healthcare, manufacturer of the CT imaging device.

“Study participants reported an improved level of comfort with the new technique,” said study author Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, primarily because it didn’t involve the diarrhea-inducing prep that keeps most people in close range of a bathroom during the night before a colonoscopy. Of the study participants who expressed a preference, 62 percent said they preferred the prep-free CT procedure over the colonoscopy.

Only sixty percent of Americans age 50 and over get the American Cancer Society’s recommended screening for colon cancer: a colonoscopy every 10 years, fecal occult blood test every year, or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or barium enema imaging every five years. Surveys suggest that patients find the prep -- required for both colonoscopy and traditional virtual colonoscopy -- to be the worst part of screening.

“A number of folks, who currently aren’t being screened because they fear the prep or aren’t willing to go through it again, may be willing to have screening if they’re told they don’t need to take laxatives and can still get a potent test,” said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colon cancer for the American Cancer Society.

About 49,000 Americans die every year from colon cancer, added Brooks, and at least half of those deaths could be prevented if everyone followed the screening recommendations.

Virtual colonoscopy, with or without prep, has some limitations. About one in five patients must undergo a standard colonoscopy after the imaging procedure to have suspicious looking polyps snipped off and biopsied. The CT scan also delivers a dose of radiation that -- while only one-fifth of the dose of an abdominal CT scan -- was significant enough to raise the flags of the US Preventive Services Task Force.

The government advisory group decided in 2008 not to recommend the use of virtual colonoscopy, saying that evidence wasn’t sufficient enough to prove that the test’s benefits outweighed its harms, which include a dose of radiation with every screening test.

(Standard colonoscopy also has rare complications such as an adverse reaction to the sedative, perforation to the colon, and bleeding from the site where the polyp was taken.)

Medicare doesn’t provide coverage for the imaging test, which Zalis said costs about one-third as much as the traditional scope screening.

Traditional colonscopy also trumps the virtual test when is comes to detecting smaller polyps, less than 10 millimeters in size. The new study found that virtual colonosopy detected only 70 percent of polyps under 8 millimeters in size, compared with 88 percent detected by a scope. What’s not clear, though, is whether missing these smaller polyps will make a difference in terms of catching growths before they turn into cancer.

“Studies are underway right now,” said Brooks, “to track these smaller lesions, to see what happens to them.”

story_reviews_00870,"May 11, 2012 -- Starting your day off with an egg may help curb your appetite better than cereal, new research suggests.

In a small study, it took longer for people who ate eggs for breakfast to show signs of hunger than it did for those who had a bowl of ready-to-eat cereal.

Scientists suspect that egg protein may be better at making people feel full longer compared to the protein found in wheat.

For people hoping to shed some pounds, changing the type of protein in the diet, rather than the amount of it, is an idea the researchers think deserves more study as a weight loss strategy.

""This study shows that diets with higher protein quality may enhance satiety, leading to better compliance and success of a weight loss diet,"" researcher Nikhil Dhurandhar, PhD, says in a news release. He is an associate professor in the department of infection and obesity at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.

One large egg has about 70 calories, and it contains about 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, and 186 milligrams of cholesterol.

The research was funded by the American Egg Board, and will be presented at the19th European Congress on Obesity in Lyon, France.",Eggs at Breakfast May Delay Hunger,1,Diet studies
story_reviews_00871,"News flash: Eggs are really good for you. This message was brought to you by the American Egg Board.

That’s right – the folks who sell eggs paid for a study that comes to the shocking conclusion that eggs are an ideal breakfast food. They could have just asked people if they liked eating eggs for breakfast.

Instead, they recruited 20 volunteers who were overweight or obese and assigned them to a week of either egg breakfasts or ready-to-eat cereal breakfasts. After a two-week gap, the groups were switched. Both types of breakfasts had the same number of calories, but the egg breakfasts contained “higher protein quality,” according to an abstract for the study, posted online here.

The folks who carried out this egg industry-funded research were from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. This place conducts some serious research on diet and weight. So to assess whether people who ate egg breakfasts were better off than their counterparts who ate cereal, they took blood samples and measured the concentration of two key hunger hormones: acylated ghrelin (which stimulates hunger) and PYY3-36 (which is how the intestines let the brain know that you’re full). Sure enough, in the week when they ate eggs, volunteers had lower acylated ghrelin and higher PYY3-36 compared with the week when they ate cereal.

The researchers also treated the volunteers to four buffet lunches. They weren’t just being nice – researchers kept track of how much food everyone ate. They found that volunteers ate smaller lunches after they ate egg breakfasts compared with when they ate cereal breakfasts. The reason: They were less hungry.

story_reviews_00872,"By Amy Norton NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People with multiple sclerosis have long said that smoking marijuana helps ease their painful muscle cramping. And a new clinical trial suggests they are not just blowing smoke.

The study, published Monday, found that for 30 MS patients with muscle “spasticity,” a few days of marijuana smoking brought some relief.

But the big caveat, researchers say, is that it’s not clear that the downsides of pot smoking are worth it.

Some people with MS are already using medical marijuana to treat certain symptoms, including spasticity — when the muscles in the legs or arms contract painfully, in something akin to a “charley horse.”

There is some science behind the idea: The body naturally produces cannabinoids, the group of chemicals found in marijuana. And studies have suggested the cannabinoid receptors on our cells help regulate muscle spasticity.

But the evidence that pot smoking actually helps with spasticity has been anecdotal.

“We’ve heard from patients that marijuana helps their spasticity, but I think a lot us thought, ‘Well, it’s probably just making you feel good,’” said Dr. Jody Corey-Bloom, the lead researcher on the new study.

“I think this study shows that yes, (marijuana) may help with spasticity, but at a cost,” said Corey-Bloom, of the University of California, San Diego.

The cost, her team found, is that smoking caused fatigue and dizziness in some users, and generally slowed down people’s mental skills soon after they used marijuana.

But it’s not clear if that would have any long-term consequences, Corey-Bloom said.

About 400,000 people in the United States have MS, a chronic disease in which the protective coating around nerve fibers starts breaking down.

The new study, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, included 30 MS patients with muscle spasticity that had failed to get better with standard medication.

Corey-Bloom’s team had each patient smoke marijuana or “placebo” joints — which looked, smelled and tasted like the real thing, but lacked the active ingredient in marijuana, known as THC.

Each patient smoked marijuana once a day for three days and used the placebo cigarette once a day on three separate days. Before and after each treatment, an independent rater assessed the patients’ muscle spasticity.

Overall, the study found, measures of spasticity dropped an average of three points —about 30 percent — on a 24-point scale when patients smoked marijuana, but didn’t change after they smoked the placebo.

The issue of treating spasticity is “certainly an important one,” said Nicholas LaRocca, vice president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society.

“Spasticity is a big problem for many people with MS, and the current medications don’t necessarily work for everyone,” said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study.

“But smoking marijuana does not appear to be a long-term solution, because of the cognitive effects,” he told Reuters Health.

People with MS are already at some risk of “cognitive changes,” LaRocca pointed out, so the potential for lasting effects from long-term marijuana smoking is a concern.

However, LaRocca said, researchers are developing cannabinoid-based medications for MS. That includes a cannabinoid mouth spray called Sativex that has been approved in the UK, Canada, Spain and New Zealand to treat MS-related spasticity.

Research into cannabinoids and spasticity should continue, LaRocca said, because medications may be able to harness the benefits of specific cannabis compounds, without the side effects linked to smoking pot.

Both LaRocca and Corey-Bloom said there were limitations to the current study.

“Blinding” people as to whether they are on marijuana or a placebo is tough since the drug creates a “high” feeling.

In this study, 17 of 30 patients were able to correctly guess whether they were using marijuana or a placebo at each of their six visits with the researchers. And the rest often guessed correctly.

“It’s pretty clear that the patients were not really blinded,” LaRocca said. “What effects that might have had on the results is unclear.”

Corey-Bloom said that should not have influenced the spasticity findings, since an independent researcher (who didn’t know whether patients were smoking marijuana or the placebo) rated spasticity using a standard scale.

But another limitation, she pointed out, is that the study looked at the effects, and side effects, of marijuana over only a few days. “We can’t say anything about long-term effects,” Corey-Bloom told Reuters Health.

For now, LaRocca recommended that people with spasticity see a doctor experienced in treating MS. And if you’re on an anti-spasticity medication and it’s not working well enough, or the side effects are too much, tell your doctor, he said.

For some people, a change in the medication dose might help.

story_reviews_00873,"When a couple is struggling to conceive, it's the woman who is usually the first — and often the only one — to be poked, prodded and analyzed, experts say. The burden of figuring out infertility is too often placed on the woman alone.



""Unfortunately, the majority of society looks at infertility as a women's issue, but that's just not the case,"" said Brad Imler, American Pregnancy Association president.



Placed among dozens of pregnancy, ovulation and female fertility kits, an at-home sperm test that hit retail shelves in April could help change that mentality, experts said.



SpermCheck Fertility, which determines in minutes whether a man's sperm count is low, offers almost instant insight into one of the many aspects of male fertility. Although it's not a comprehensive evaluation and could give some consumers a false sense of security, the test does provide a starting point while drawing attention to male infertility as a legitimate health concern.



""It may provide (an opportunity for) both physicians and couples to take a closer look at ways for men to step up to the plate and optimize their reproductive potential,"" said Dr. Robert Brannigan, urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""I think anything that highlights the fact that men can have issues, that men do play a role in infertility, is important.""



Approximately 15 percent of U.S. couples of reproductive age who are trying to conceive face infertility issues, said Brannigan, an expert in male fertility.



Male infertility contributes to 50 percent of those cases, he said. Male infertility alone is the cause 30 percent of the time; a combination of male and female factors account for the other 20 percent.



SpermCheck Fertility is designed to help couples determine more quickly whether male infertility might be a problem for them, said Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, based in Charlottesville, Va. Many men put off having a semen analysis because they don't want to provide a sample in a doctor's office or lab, he said.



""No one wants to go through the embarrassment of jumping in that room and looking at dirty magazines,"" Lopez said.



Giving men the opportunity to take a test in the privacy of their home helps get the process moving, he said.



Men tend to think they're perfectly healthy, especially when it comes to their sexuality, APA's Imler said. This test, which is noninvasive, could be wake-up call for some.



""If there is a problem with him, it's identified a little quicker,"" Imler said. ""We love the idea of avoiding that heartache of that month to month struggle of trying to conceive without success.""



SpermCheck Fertility is the only FDA-approved home sperm test currently on the market and available in retail stores, Lopez said. The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor's office is about $100.



At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. Four years ago an FDA-approved home test called Fertell, which is no longer for sale, offered an evaluation of both male and female fertility.



There are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.



Although it's not the first ever at-home test, SpermCheck Fertility is the first one to use the lateral flow assay method, Lopez said. When the semen sample is applied to the test strip, the liquid works its way up the paper until it reaches the results window.



""It's very, very similar to a pregnancy test,"" Lopez said. ""The concept behind our test is to keep it simple, user friendly.""



For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she was surprised by the number of steps involved, although none were very difficult.



Scott, a ""mommy blogger"" who requested and received a free test to review, said she wanted her husband to take the test to see if a recent vasectomy had worked. The result showed that the father of four's sperm count was below the test's threshold.



""It was blatantly negative. I was really glad that the test was not ambiguous at all,"" she said. ""There was no line I could mistake.""



Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. After about 11 months of trying, she had pushed her husband to get a semen analysis from a doctor.



""If this test had been around back then, he would have definitely been more willing to do it"" than the semen analysis, she said.



(Also available is a more sensitive product called SpermCheck Vasectomy, which indicates whether a man's sperm count is above or below 250,000 sperm per milliliter.)



SpermCheck Fertility tests were created after a scientist at the University of Virginia discovered a specific protein found only in the head of sperm, Lopez said. By detecting that protein, the test indicates whether or not a semen sample contains 20 million sperm per milliliter.



About 90 percent of fertile men have sperm counts above that concentration, according to the SpermCheck Fertility instructions.



But there is not a strict cutoff point between normal or abnormal, Brannigan said. Some men might be considered in the infertile range and have no problem impregnating a woman. And others have sperm counts that seem fine, but they have difficulty.



""If his sperm concentration is indeed greater than 20 million, that's very encouraging,"" Brannigan said. ""But it's by no means a definitive marker of proven fertility because there is a significant overlap between fertile and infertile men.""



As stated in the SpermCheck Fertility instructions, sperm count is not the only factor that contributes to male fertility. The test is not intended to be a complete semen analysis or an overall indicator of a man's fertility, Lopez said.



The male reproductive system should not be oversimplified, Brannigan said. There are several characteristics of sperm alone — at least three that aren't addressed by SpermCheck — that affect male fertility. In addition, hormones and the delivery of the sperm play a part.



""There are a number of components that lead to a man having normal fertility potential,"" Brannigan said. ""It's a complicated picture.""



First of all, a man's hormones need to be normal, he said. The hormones drive sperm production, libido and sexual function.



Hormone abnormalities — found in 18 to 20 percent of men with infertility issues — can originate in the brain, pituitary gland or testicles and can be addressed with medical or hormonal treatment, he said.



As for sperm production, the concentration or count, volume of ejaculate, motility, morphology and DNA are all important, he said.



The higher the sperm concentration the better, Brannigan said. A lower sperm count means decreased odds that a sperm will have a successful encounter with the egg and pregnancy will be achieved.



The volume of ejaculate, if low, can indicate a lack of seminal emission, he said.



If the sperm don't have movement, they can't travel from the vaginal fluid to the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs, he said.



Some studies suggest that the shape, or morphology, is an indicator for sperm function and that normally shaped sperm are most likely to be capable of reaching the egg and fertilizing it, Brannigan said.



Sperm DNA can also be abnormal or damaged.



A number of scenarios can negatively affect sperm production, including injury or exposure to excessive heat, harmful chemicals, radiation or toxins, Brannigan said. Medical conditions and genetic disorders also can have an impact.



The delivery of the sperm is another area where problems can arise, he said.



Some men suffer from retrograde ejaculation, a situation where some or all of the ejaculate goes into the bladder instead of exiting the tip of the penis, he said.



Sometimes there will be a high level of bacteria or white blood cells in the semen, which can markedly damage sperm quality, he said. In other cases, there is urine mixing with the sperm.



""A man can have all these different issues going on,"" Brannigan said. ""I think it's important to point out it's not just about sperm number.""



If men use the SpermCheck test as their only infertility evaluation, there are numerous problems that could be overlooked, he said.



A positive result from the SpermCheck Fertility test could give men a false sense that everything is all right, APA's Imler said.



It might even cause some men to delay a necessary doctor's evaluation, Brannigan said.



""By bypassing readily correctable issues in the man, we then shift the burden to the female for testing and procedures that could potentially be averted by optimizing the man's reproductive potential,"" he said.



The burden is already on the women because most men delay undergoing semen analyses, Lopez said. At least the SpermCheck Fertility test will provide a push to those men who get a negative result.



""When a man quickly identifies he might have a problem, the first thing a man is going to do is run to the doctor,"" he said.",Men's fertility test available for home,5,Chicago Tribune

HealthDay Reporter

TUESDAY, May 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have found new evidence showing that resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, may play a role in preventing cell aging.

The study in rodents found that when mice had a particular gene -- SIRT1 -- knocked out, or turned off, resveratrol had no effect on them. But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.

Mitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

But don't go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But ""the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,"" Sinclair said.

Instead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. ""My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,"" Sinclair said.

The study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.

While previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.

But other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.

Testing the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.

So Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.

""Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,"" Sinclair said.

The paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.

Sinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.

George Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the ""first definitive evidence"" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.

""The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,"" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.

Philippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.

""In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,"" Marambaud said.

While studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.

""A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,"" Marambaud said. ""This field has been extremely controversial. We should be very careful about claiming the importance of resveratrol for medical purposes. We have to wait and see, but this study is a big step forward.""

story_reviews_00875,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - New findings suggest that the antidepressant Lexapro might make hot flashes a little less of a nuisance to women — adding to the mixed bag of results regarding that drug’s effect on menopause symptoms.

The study, of 205 women, found that those randomly assigned to take Lexapro (escitalopram) for eight weeks reported less daily “interference” from their hot flashes.

Compared with women given inactive placebo pills, they said hot flashes were taking less of a toll on their work, daily activities, sleep and general mood. Women on the placebo also improved over time, however.

The findings come from the same clinical trial that, last year, showed Lexapro halved the number of hot flashes women had each day. (See Reuters story of January 18, 2011.)

A separate study a few months later showed no such benefit, however. In two trials of 36 women, researchers found that Lexapro did not cut the number or severity of hot flashes over eight weeks. (See Reuters Health story of May 26, 2011.)

And the lead researcher on that study said these latest findings are “nothing to write home about.”

“The differences between the treatment and placebo groups are very small,” said Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University in Detroit.

In general, studies of hot-flash remedies over the years have “virtually always found a large placebo effect,” Freedman noted in an interview.

That could mean that study participants’ hot flashes are just getting better over time, which they sometimes do.

“But my feeling is that it’s the placebo effect,” Freedman said, referring to the phenomenon of study participants on placebos improving because they believe they are getting a real treatment.

Hot flashes, which mostly affect women transitioning to menopause and already in that phase of life, involve a sudden sensation of heat, sometimes accompanied by sweating or visible reddening of the skin.

Their exact cause is unknown, but hormonal regulation of body temperature is thought to be involved.

Bouts of hot flashes can happen many times a day and past research has found they can continue for anywhere from a few months to up to 10 years.

So far, Freedman noted, the only hot-flash treatment that has consistently worked in studies is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

And right now, HRT is the only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for cooling hot flashes.

But women and doctors are wary of HRT these days — since a 2002 clinical trial linked the hormones to increased risks of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and blood clots.

So researchers have been looking for alternatives. And studies have suggested that a few antidepressants, used at low doses, can be helpful for some women — including paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac) and venlafaxine (Effexor).

This latest study, reported in the journal Fertility & Sterility, focused on hot flash “interference” — the degree to which women feel hot flashes disrupt their lives.

That’s important because it gets at quality of life, according to the researchers, led by Janet S. Carpenter of Indiana University in Indianapolis.

The trial included 205 women who were having at least 28 bouts of hot flashes or “night sweats” a week. Carpenter’s team randomly assigned half to use Lexapro for eight weeks, while the other half were given placebo pills.

The women kept diaries to record their hot flash symptoms. And every four weeks, they filled out a questionnaire on hot-flash interference.

After four weeks, the study found, women on the antidepressant saw their score on the interference scale fall by half, on average. It remained there at week eight.

But women in the placebo group also improved, albeit more slowly and to a somewhat lesser degree.

In a separate analysis of the same study group, Carpenter’s team found that women on Lexapro also reported bigger improvements in sleep problems: half saw their insomnia symptoms drop by at least 50 percent, versus 35 percent of placebo users.

Those findings appear in a separate report in the journal Menopause.

Freedman said that the overall research on antidepressants and hot flashes is still inconsistent. “Overall, the picture is not optimistic.”

In his own study last year, Freedman used a different approach to measuring hot flashes: instead of asking women to record their symptoms in a diary, the researchers had them wear a “detector” to monitor objective measures of hot flashes.

“I trust the objective measure more,” Freedman said.

It is possible for women’s hot flashes to remain unchanged objectively, but have their subjective experience of them change. “But that raises the question of why,” Freedman said.

And for now, he noted, it’s also not clear why antidepressants would have effects on hot flashes.

Lexapro, which costs about $125 a month, belongs to the group of antidepressants called selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). They increase levels of the brain chemical serotonin, which may have a role in regulating body heat.

But no one knows if altering serotonin levels actually does affect women’s hot flashes. In fact, Freedman said, there’s some evidence that lowering serotonin levels does not worsen hot flashes — which would be expected if the “serotonin theory” is correct.

Antidepressants can also have side effects, like nausea, drowsiness, headache, constipation and dry mouth.

Right now, no antidepressant is specifically approved to treat hot flashes. But in the U.S., doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs “off-label” for conditions other than their approved uses.

Besides antidepressants, doctors sometimes prescribe certain blood pressure medications or the anti-seizure drug gabapentin, which some studies suggest may be helpful.

Hot flashes often need no drug treatment at all, though.

If they are not severe, experts say simple steps can be enough — like avoiding hot and spicy foods, turning down the thermostat, or trying relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation.

There are several herbal or “natural” products marketed for easing menopause symptoms, including black cohosh, soy, red clover and dong quai. But there is little evidence that they work, according to the North American Menopause Society.

story_reviews_00876,"Many migraine sufferers could have fewer, less severe headaches if they took preventive medicines, but few eligible patients do, say doctors releasing updated treatment guidelines Monday.

The guidelines list seven prescription medicines and one herbal remedy backed by strong evidence, and include many other treatments that might work for some patients.

""Migraine is one of the most disabling conditions known to man, but patients need to know that there is hope,"" says Stephen Silberstein, a neurologist at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia and lead author of the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society. They were presented at an academy meeting and published in the journal Neurology.

Medicines backed by the strongest evidence include anti-seizure drugs (divalproex sodium, sodium valproate and topiramate), blood pressure drugs (metoprolol, propranolol and timolol) and, for menstrual-related migraines, a medicine called frovatriptan, the guidelines say. They also cite strong support for the herbal remedy butterbur and include a longer list of prescription and non-prescription therapies patients can consider.

More about migraines Migraines are not ordinary headaches. They cause throbbing pain, often on one side of the head, and can come with nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and sound. Visual disturbances or other warning signs, called auras, may precede the headaches. Migraines are three times more common in women than men. In some susceptible people, stress, bright lights, lack of food or sleep, hormonal changes or other triggers may play roles.



Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

These preventive treatments usually are used daily. The guidelines do not look at the options patients have once symptoms begin.

Not everyone with migraines needs prevention medicine. But nearly 40% have headaches that are so frequent (at least once a week), severe or hard-to-treat that they qualify, Silberstein says. Studies find that just 3% to 13% use the treatments.

Why so few? One reason is that it's hard to persuade people to take medicines on days when they feel fine, says Elizabeth Loder, a neurologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Silberstein adds that some patients have not been properly diagnosed or made aware of their options. Still others try the treatments and decide they don't work or have unacceptable side effects.

""You have a lot of gun-shy patients because of a lot of bad experiences,"" says Michael John Coleman, founder of the patient group MAGNUM, also known as the National Migraine Association. Many spend months or years taking medicines that don't work and make them miserable, he says.

That's what happened to Emily Guzan, 26, a lawyer from Pittsburgh who was diagnosed with migraine in 2008. She was given a prescription for Topamax (topiramate), and it ""was a real nightmare,"" she says. She kept having headaches bad enough to land her in an emergency room once a month and suffered nightmares, an altered sense of taste, an unwanted 30-pound weight loss and memory problems — all of which she attributes to the drug.

She tried some other medications, but for now, she's given up on all of them and says she's getting better results with diet, yoga and other lifestyle changes.

Finding the right medication for the right patient can take a lot of trial and error and careful dosing, Silberstein says. But about 80% will get relief, he says — defined as a headache reduction of at least 50% — after trying three or four drugs, alternative remedies and lifestyle changes.

Even hard-to-treat patients may eventually respond to something, Loder says, so she urges frustrated patients to keep trying.

""The life toll that poorly controlled headaches take is really underappreciated,"" she says. ""You don't get back the time you lost at work or the time you lost with your children.""

Coleman, of Alexandria, Va., also urges fellow sufferers to keep working with their doctors: His own migraines took 40 years to control. ""This is not a cookie-cutter disease and there is no magic bullet, but there is hope.""",Preventive medicines can help migraine sufferers,4,USA Today
story_reviews_00877,"If you had a history of suffering from migraines and could prevent the debilitating headaches by swallowing a few pills, you’d do it – wouldn’t you?

Actually, odds are you wouldn’t. Neurologists say that only about one-third of those who could benefit by migraine-preventing medication actually use it.

Preventive treatment involves taking a seizure drug and a beta-blocker every day to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of migraines. Neurologists estimate that about 38% of people who suffer from migraines stand to benefit with such a regimen, and studies suggest that as many as half of migraines can be prevented with drugs, according to Dr. Stephen D. Silberstein, a neurologist at the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Silberstein was the lead author of new migraine treatment guidelines presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in New Orleans.

It would seem that migraineurs would be eager to stop these headaches before they start. In a summary of the guidelines written for patients and their families, this is how migraines are described:

Advertisement

“Migraine is a condition that involves recurring headaches. Each headache may last from four hours to two days. It can cause throbbing pain in the head. Other symptoms may include nausea (upset stomach), vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light or sound. Most people with migraine have attacks that happen repeatedly.”

Yuck.

People whose migraines are infrequent or mild may not be able to prevent them with drugs, the guidelines say. But for those who can, the best seizure drugs are divalproex sodium (Depakote), sodium valproate (Depakote, Depakene, Stavzor) and topiramate (Topamax or Topiragen). Beta-blockers are usually taken to treat high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions, though metoprolol (Lopressor or Toprol), propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren) can also help with migraines.

The authors also noted that frovatriptan (Frova), which is used to treat migraine symptoms, can also help prevent menstrual migraines.

These medications “are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity,” Silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines, which were based on a review of 284 publications.

In addition, an herbal remedy derived from a family of plants called Petasites or butterbur was found to be effective, according to the review.

The review identified a handful of drugs that “are probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention.” These include the antidepressants amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep or Vanatrip) and venlafaxine (Effexor); the beta blockers atenolol (Senormin or Tenormin) and nadolol (Corgard); and for menstrual migraines, naratriptan (Amerge) and zolmitriptan (Zomig).

“People need to keep in mind that all drugs, includingover-the-counter drugsand complementary treatments, can have side effects or interact with other medications, which should be monitored,” Silberstein said in a statement.

Five of the six co-authors of the new guidelines, including Silberstein, disclosed that they receive research funding, speaking fees and other payments from drug companies.

The guidelines will be published in Tuesday’s edition of the journal Neurology. They were developed in conjunction with the American Headache Society. You can read the new guidelines here, or check out the patient-friendly summary here.

story_reviews_00879,"No one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer’s disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder’s key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer’s, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?

Those questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.

And on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy’s “Emerging Science” program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer’s by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.

Until recently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease could be made only after a patient’s death, when a pathologist could find physical evidence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer’s plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection, accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.

The FDA says that Amyvid “is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia” in those who have no problematic symptoms. It’s an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer’s disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer’s disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Weiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer’s research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain’s structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid’s approval.

For now, says Weiner, there is “no consensus” on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer’s disease, said Weiner.

“But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,” said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.

With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer’s disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The “real game-changer,” he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer’s disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.","Alzheimer’s: New test aids early diagnosis, but worth it to know?",3,Alzheimer's

An experimental treatment for prostate cancer tumors using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows promise as an effective treatment with fewer side effects than existing therapies.

The idea behind the new procedure is similar to lumpectomy in breast cancer patients, in which doctors remove only the tumors instead of the entire breast. Using HIFU, doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland, HIFU may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence.

(MORE: Circumcision: The Surgery that May Lower Prostate-Cancer Risk)

The new study, designed as a proof-of-concept study, involved just 41 men. Doctors used MRI and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues. They then focused high-energy sound waves on the affected area, causing the cancer cells to heat up to around 80°C, which kills the cells. None of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment, and only 1 in 10 suffered from poor erections. Overall, about 95% of the men were cancer-free after a full year following the trial.

“The signal from this study is quite strong,” study author Hashim Ahmed, a urologist at the University College London, told Bloomberg. “When you look at the current standard of care, there’s a 1-in-3, or 1-in-2 chance of having the perfect outcome. In this study, after 12 months, it’s a 9-in-10 chance.”

The men in the study were aged 45 to 80 with medium- to high-risk cancer, and would likely have undergone surgery or radiotherapy down the line. Men who had already received chemotherapy, hormone treatment or radiation therapy were excluded from the study. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia and most of the patients had hospital stays of less than 24 hours after the treatment.

(MORE: Cancer Rates Decline Overall, but Obesity and Tanning Lead to Upticks)

“Focal therapy of individual prostate-cancer lesions, regardless of whether they are multifocal or unifocal, leads to a low rate of genitourinary side-effects and an encouraging rate of early freedom from clinically significant prostate cancer,” the authors concluded in the study.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men. The National Cancer Institute estimates 241,740 new cases of prostate cancer this year in the U.S. and 28,170 deaths.

Ahmed told Bloomberg that HIFU may also be cheaper than other standard treatments, noting that the cost of the MRI and mapping was an estimated $2,400, plus about $1,600 for HIFU; in comparison, removing the prostate costs about $7,100. Fewer side effects would also lower other health care costs, he said.

(MORE: The Screening Dilemma)

The researchers are now recruiting more patients and seeking funding for larger studies. While the initial results were promising, they need to be replicated; HIFU also needs to be studied long-term and compared with other therapies. If the technology holds up, it could also work for other cell-based cancers like breast, thyroid, pancreas and liver, Ahmed said.

Largely due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, the herb thyme -- which is found with other herbs in the produce section of most food stores -- may well earn itself a place in the skin care section of your local drug store.

Researchers from Leeds Metropolitan University in the U.K. steeped thyme, marigold, and myrrh in alcohol to make what's called a tincture, and then tested them on the bacteria that cause acne. They all had greater antibacterial effect after five minutes compared to lab specimens exposed to plain alcohol, but thyme was the most potent.

In fact, the thyme tincture was more powerful than standard concentrations of benzoyl peroxide, which is the active ingredient in many acne products. The new findings were presented at the Society for General Microbiology's Spring Conference in Dublin.

""If thyme tincture is proven to be as clinically effective as our findings suggest, it may be a natural alternative to current treatments,"" researcher Margarita Gomez-Escalada, PhD, says in a news release. ""The problem with treatments containing benzoyl peroxide is the side effects they are associated with,"" namely a burning sensation and skin irritation.

""Herbal preparations are less harsh on the skin due to their anti-inflammatory properties, while our results suggest they can be just as, if not more, effective than chemical treatments,"" she says.

story_reviews_00883,"About 28 million Americans have sleep apnea, which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night, sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air. For decades, the standard treatment has been “continuous positive airway pressure.” A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.

Joseph A. Golish M.D.

But the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.

“For a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,” said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. “C.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there’s a good chance they won’t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.”

Now an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn’t work for every patient.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.

Bob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.

The diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.

His doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.

“I had this constricted feeling,” he said. “It would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie ‘Alien.’ It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.”

Mr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. “After I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,” he said. “My symptoms subsided dramatically.”

Provent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.

Provent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily — most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep — but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.

Last year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.

But not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.

“It works like a champ in some people and doesn’t work on other people,” said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. “All sleep apnea is not created equal.”

Some people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn’t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.

Unlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.

Dr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50. He has prescribed Provent to about 300 of his patients.

“The No. 1 reason people don’t continue it is the out-of-pocket expense,” he said.

For now, Dr. Kryger and others say that C.P.A.P. will continue to be the gold standard, and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea. But for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom C.P.A.P. fails, Provent may be a reliable alternative.

Dr. Surkin said some patients use C.P.A.P. at home, but take their pocket-size Provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports.

“To me, it’s a miracle,” said Joyce Nemoga, 64. Ms. Nemoga, who lives in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., has moderate apnea that caused her to snore and gasp in her sleep. She tried C.P.A.P. but could not sleep comfortably with the device.

“Every time you turn over, you have to take the hose with you,” she said. “I tried it for six months, and I don’t think I had one full night of sleep the whole time.”

A doctor suggested Provent, and Ms. Nemoga saw quick results.

WEDNESDAY, April 4, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Regularly consumption of food and drink rich in substances called flavonoids, such as berries, apples, tea and red wine, can lower a man's risk of developing Parkinson's disease by 40 percent, new research suggests.

For women, however, a reduction in risk was only seen when they ate at least several servings of berries a week, according to the study. Men also had a risk reduction from frequently eating berries.

""For total flavonoids, the beneficial result was only in men. But, berries are protective in both men and women,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Xiang Gao, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

""Berries could be a neuroprotective agent. People can include berries in their regular diet. There are no harmful effects from berry consumption, and they lower the risk of hypertension too,"" Gao added.

Results of the study are published online April 4 in the journal Neurology.

Parkinson's disease is a degenerative condition that affects the central nervous system. It causes movement disorders, such as tremors, rigidity and balance problems. About 500,000 Americans have Parkinson's disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Flavonoids are substances found in plant foods that help prevent damage to the body's cells, known as oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries.

For the study, the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost 50,000 men enrolled in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study and more than 80,000 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study.

The researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources: tea, berries, apples, orange juice and red wine.

Over 20 to 22 years of follow-up, 805 people developed Parkinson's disease -- 438 men and 367 women.

When researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least, they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit, lowering their risk of Parkinson's by 40 percent.

Gao said it wasn't clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake, but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women. Gao said it's not clear if there's a biological mechanism causing these differences, or another factor.

But, when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually, it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women, lowering the risk of Parkinson's disease by about 25 percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week.

Gao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti-inflammatory effect, which may be how berries help to reduce Parkinson's risk.

The study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it's possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said.

Dr. Michael Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, said, ""It is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as Parkinson's.""

But, he added, it's important for people to realize that this research isn't applicable to people who already have the disease.

He also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson's disease.

MONDAY, April 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A vaccine to prevent breast cancer's return in women with a history of the disease has triggered the desired immune response in early research.

The vaccine under development is aimed at preventing recurrence in women who have a form of tumor known as HER2-positive, according to researcher Dr. Diane Hale, a research resident in general surgery at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio.

She is set to present results of the study on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago.

The vaccine, known as the ""HER2-based peptide vaccine AE37,"" is designed to harness the power of the patient's immune system, based on its reaction to a cancer-linked peptide (protein).

""The theory is that once you form that [immune] response to the specific peptide, if the body has a recurrence, it will recognize that cancer as a bad thing, a foreign thing,"" Hale explained in an association news release.

The study is a phase 2 study, meant to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness and any side effects. Phase 3 studies are needed before the vaccine could be approved.

The science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out.

HER2-positive breast cancer tests positive for a protein known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, which promotes the tumor cell growth. About one of every five breast cancers involves cancer cells that churn out an excess of HER2 due to a genetic mutation. HER2-positive breast cancers are often more aggressive than other types, according to the American Cancer Society.

The goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it.

""If your immune system has been educated by the vaccine to recognize the tumor cells, we think it will allow the immune system to take care of any individual [cancer] cells trying to set up shop,"" explained Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, a surgical oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She is the principal investigator on the trial.

The study involved 217 breast cancer survivors who had gone through their treatment and were free of disease at the start of the trial. The women were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine paired with an immune stimulant, or the immune stimulant alone.

The women received monthly injections for six months. The researchers then conducted a variety of tests to gauge each woman's immune system response.

The investigators found that in the vaccinated group, 86 percent of patients showed a significant response, compared with 27 percent of those in the ""control"" group who did not get the injection.

How to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? ""For the controls, even without having their immune systems 'educated' towards HER2 specifically, they may still mount a response because they have previously seen HER2 within their own cancer,"" Hale said.

Those who were vaccinated also displayed a decrease in certain cells that suppress the immune system. That is a good thing, Hale said, because ""an increase in these cells has been found to be associated with [cancer] recurrence.""

Don Diamond, director of translational vaccine research and a professor of virology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., reviewed the findings and said, ""Their approach is well thought out and makes sense.""

Still, the study remains very preliminary, he cautioned. ""Whether it actually has an increase in survival remains to be seen,"" he said.

That study will be done, Hale said, and they plan to follow the women for three years and look at survival differences.

But until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way.

Numerous vaccines to prevent breast cancer recurrence are currently under study, he noted.

Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00888,"SATURDAY, March 31, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A noninvasive scan might someday help doctors track the progress of prostate cancer and help guide treatment, researchers report.

The imaging tool, known as a prostate cancer-specific radiotracer, has so far only been tested successfully in mice. But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.

Radiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.

In studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.

The study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.

The findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.

If used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors ""personalize"" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.

""The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,"" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.

Encouraged by their findings, the study's authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.

Two prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.

Dr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.

Both methods have their limits and, ""while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,"" Schwartz said. ""It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.""

Dr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, ""this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.""

He believes that the new tool's ""greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence ""personalized"" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.""

However, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and ""further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.""

story_reviews_00889,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be effective in treating depression, a study in Hong Kong has found.

Led by Zhang Zhang-jin at the School of Chinese Medicine, University of Hong Kong, the researchers used electroacupuncture to stimulate seven spots on the heads of 73 participants, who had suffered several bouts of depression in the last 7 years.

The electroacupuncture was given in addition to medication that the patients were already taking and meant to augment their treatment, Zhang told a news conference.

Half the patients received electroacupuncture nine times over three weeks, while the other half - the placebo group - only had needles inserted superficially into their heads.

They were later assessed by experts for their depression levels and the group that received genuine electroacupuncture was found to be a lot happier.

“The drop (in depression scores) among the group receiving active treatment was more significant than the placebo group,” said Roger Ng, another researcher in the group, which published their findings in the journal PLoS (Public Library of Science) ONE.

“When the acupoints are stimulated, some brain centres responsible for producing serotonin are stimulated,” explained Ng, a consultant at the department of psychiatry at the Kowloon Hospital in Hong Kong.

An imbalance in serotonin levels is believed to be linked to depression. Depression affects about 20 percent of people at some point in their lives.

The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world.

Zhang said his group may consider moving into another trial using only electroacupuncture on patients suffering milder depression.",Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study,1,Depression
story_reviews_00890,"CHICAGO—For patients facing a choice between bypass surgery and a popular, less-invasive procedure to treat heart blockages, surgery improves chances of long-term survival, researchers said Tuesday.

In a study that analyzed data on nearly 190,000 Medicare patients treated between 2003 and 2007, 16.4% of surgery patients had died after four years, compared with 20.8% treated with angioplasty and a stent to prop open diseased vessels.

The study, funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute through funds available from the federal stimulus program, is an example of what is called comparative effectiveness research, a broad government-backed effort to determine which among various options to treat illness delivers the best results for patients.

The latest research, which is generally consistent with other recent studies that give an advantage to bypass surgery, is one of the most ambitious efforts to address the question.

The study didn't include data on whether a patient is healthy or frail, or what a patient's preference was, researchers said. It is possible, for instance, that patients were referred to stent use because they were too sick to withstand surgery, and that could be an important reason for the higher death rate among those patients.

William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Delaware and the study's lead investigator, said the results call for more collaboration between heart surgeons who perform bypass surgeries and interventional cardiologists who deploy stents to make sure patients are carefully evaluated and informed of their options before their procedures.

He cautioned that all of the studies—including the new one—have limitations. ""I don't think anybody would say the results will completely change the way we do things,"" said Dr. Weintraub, who presented the results at the annual scientific meeting of the American College of Cardiology. They were also published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.

The gold standard for testing medical treatments is the randomized trial, in which patients are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group to spread patient differences evenly and avoid bias in results. But such trials typically have strict enrollment criteria and findings often can't be generalized to the broader population.

Registry studies such as the current one enable researchers to use accumulated data on the real-world experience of thousands of patients, but as the current study suggests, that doesn't necessarily resolve uncertainty over which treatment approach is better.

The result ""doesn't change much,"" said Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University, who wasn't involved in the study. ""It nudges you a little closer to surgery, but it's not a very big nudge.""

The paper is based on data from Medicare beneficiaries included in an American College of Cardiology Foundation registry of patients who got angioplasty and stent procedures and in another database on bypass surgery maintained by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Medicare data are included as well.

Researchers found that at one year after the procedures, death rates were about the same for surgery and stents, reflecting the higher risk of mortality from the open-heart procedure itself—about 2% for surgery compared with about 1% for stenting. The short-term risk of surgery can affect patients' treatment decision, especially given the prospect of open-heart surgery and weeks of recovery, compared with a less-invasive angioplasty.

The new data suggest doctors can tell patients if they survive the surgery, they will live longer down the road, said Michael Crawford, clinical cardiology chief at University of California at San Francisco, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Some patients buy that. For some it's a tough sell.""

The patients studied had heart disease in two or three of the vessels that provide blood to the heart. They were stable, and thus didn't need a procedure urgently. Currently, such patients could be candidates for either approach.

Kirk Garratt, director of research at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and an interventional cardiologist who wasn't involved in the study, said patients who choose stents shouldn't think they're ""making a dreadful mistake"" about their care based on the new data.

But Fred Edwards, emeritus professor of surgery at University of Florida, Jacksonville, and a co-author of the study, said he thought the results favoring surgery ""should influence practice.""

The debate over coronary bypass surgery versus stenting goes back decades.

Studies have been inconclusive, but doctors and patients have voted with their feet in favor of the less-invasive procedure — clearing clogged arteries and propping them open with tiny scaffolds called stents.

U.S. doctors do at least two stenting procedures these days for every coronary bypass operation.

Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or ""cabbages"") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.

Put another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.

Is that a big difference? Well, the study's lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to ""tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so.""

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new ""stimulus"" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications.

""We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they're going in,"" the NHLBI's Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots. He says it's been worrying that so many doctors have been opting for stenting over surgery.

Study author Dr. William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., is presenting the data at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine.

It draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting. They had blockages in either two or three coronary arteries but did not require emergency procedures.

Although the pro-surgery outcome is not a game-changer, Weintraub says it might cause some doctors and patients to consider surgery. And he says it supports those who now opt for CABGs.

""It's a very big deal to recommend coronary surgery to patients,"" Weintraub says. ""I think doctors work very hard to weigh what's best for their patients. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one.""

But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. Only studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can do that. Mauri is an interventional cardiologist – i.e., a specialist who does coronary stenting – at Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston.

Weintraub notes it's ""very difficult and expensive"" to do randomized studies on this question – and to make the comparison groups truly comparable. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings.

So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.",Bypass Surgery Edges Stents For Heart Treatment,4,heart disease
story_reviews_00893,"When roasted at 475 degrees, coffee beans are sometimes described as rich and full-bodied. But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests.

In a study presented Tuesday at the American Chemical Society’s spring national meeting in San Diego, 16 overweight young adults took, by turns, a low dose of green coffee bean extract, a high dose of the supplement, and a placebo. Though the study was small, the results were striking: Subjects lost an average of 17.5 pounds in 22 weeks and reduced their overall body weight by 10.5%.

If green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration, these results would make it a viable candidate — more than 35% of subjects lost more than 5% of their body weight, and weight loss appeared to be greater while subjects were taking the pills than when they were on the placebo.

But as a dietary supplement, green coffee extract does not require the FDA’s blessing. In fact, it is already available as a naturopathic medicine and antioxidant.

Joe Vinson, the University of Scranton chemist who conducted the pilot study, said the findings should pave the way for more rigorous research on coffee bean extract’s effects. A larger trial involving 60 people is being planned.

Vinson, whose research focuses on plant polyphenols and their effects on human health, said it appears that green coffee bean extract may work by reducing the absorption of fat and glucose in the gut; it may also reduce insulin levels, which would improve metabolic function. There were no signs of ill effects on any subjects, Vinson reported Tuesday.

The study used a “cross-over” design, which allowed each subject to serve as his or her own comparison group. For six weeks, volunteers swallowed capsules three times a day, ingesting either 700 or 1,050 milligrams of green coffee extract a day or taking a placebo. After a two-week break, they moved, round-robin style, to another arm of the trial.

Subjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial. But the more extract they consumed, the more weight and fat they lost. Altogether, they reduced their body fat by 16%, on average.

Of the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range.

One downside is that the extract is “extremely bitter.” It would be difficult to take without a lot of water, Vinson reported.

At roughly $20 per month, however, green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight-loss medications available over the counter or by prescription.

The trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract.

The pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren’t involved in the research.

“This is certainly a provocative study,” said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a physician and biochemist at New York University. But he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause “malabsorption” within the human gut — a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine.

Dr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals — some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do.

TUESDAY, March 27, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- When taken as a supplement, unroasted -- or green -- coffee-bean extract can help people shed pounds, according to a small preliminary study.

The research, which is being presented this week at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego, involved just 16 overweight and obese patients who were given daily doses of green coffee extract in capsule form.

All the patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits, while the study team monitored them for weight loss over a period of nearly six months.

The apparent result: Daily consumption of a small amount of green coffee extract translated into a nearly 11 percent drop in body weight, on average.

The study was conducted in India and funded by Applied Food Sciences, the American manufacturer of two green-coffee-extract products. It has not been published in a journal, and therefore has yet to undergo peer review.

Supplements of this kind, however, are not subject to the rigorous U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety and efficacy testing typically applied to all pharmaceutical medications.

""This was indeed a small study,"" acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania, but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan. ""Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss. But here, with higher extract doses than have been used before, the patients experienced what I would call rather large weight loss.""

""While this of course needs to be confirmed with follow-up, I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration,"" Vinson added.

Vinson said his team was not focused on the weight-loss impact of caffeine as much as that of unprocessed, unroasted coffee's primary ingredient: chlorogenic acid.

""That's the main natural compound in unroasted coffee, and roasted coffee has much, much less of it than unprocessed coffee,"" Vinson said. ""So we're not talking about something that is interchangeable with the coffee we drink,"" which is produced by roasting beans at a temperature between 464 and 482 degrees Fahrenheit.

Green coffee-bean extracts are sold online at prices ranging from about $10 to $20 for 60 capsules.

The study was broken into three six-week sections. In one section, study participants, who were all between the ages of 22 and 26, consumed a capsule filled with 700 milligrams of green coffee extract. In the second section, participants took a 1,050-milligram capsule. The third section had participants taking a placebo. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.

While maintaining their pre-study dietary and exercise regimens, the patients lost an average of 17 pounds by the study's close. On average, patients lost 10.5 percent and 16 percent of their body weight and body fat, respectively.

""Basically, there was steady weight loss, without side effects, while the active green coffee extract was being taken at either dose,"" Vinson said.

A follow-up study involving 60 patients is now in the planning stages.

Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas, cautioned that the study is short on specifics, making it difficult to draw any conclusions.

""First of all, you need more than 16 people to have any statistical significance attached to these findings,"" Sandon said. ""And we really have no idea how this might be working. For example, the patients were allowed to continue with their regular diet. But did this extract in any way influence their hunger and what they wanted to eat, and then what they actually ate? We don't know. What we have here is basically just a hypothesis that there's something about this compound that could be helpful.""

""Just because it might cause weight loss doesn't mean it's healthy,"" she warned. ""Because supplements are not regulated as drugs, they can be put on the market with no safety or efficacy testing. They don't even necessarily have to be tested for purity.""

""That means that in the past, various weight-loss supplements have been found to contain weight-loss drugs or other drugs at higher doses than what would be allowed in a prescription dose,"" Sandon added. ""So while people might have this perception that it's all natural since it's coming from a coffee bean, with supplements in general it's still a buyer-beware market.""

story_reviews_00895,"A new, experimental cholesterol-fighting drug is creating quite a buzz among researchers and other experts, prompting some to use words such as ""dramatic,"" ""breakthrough"" and ""game changing,"" to describe early-stage clinical trial results.

If these initial results pan out in larger trials, the drug could prove to be more effective than statins, the widely prescribed drugs which have been very successful in lowering levels of LDL - or bad cholesterol.

Researchers have known for some time that when the protein PCSK9, which stands for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9, binds to LDL receptors on the liver, it compromises the organ's ability to filter the bad cholesterol from the blood.



Too much LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood can lead to the thickening of artery walls, making them less flexible and therefore impairing their function and increasing the risk of heart disease.

In this phase one clinical trial, which is designed to determine if a drug is safe, researchers found that using a monoclonal antibody (lab-produced protein) called REGN727, was not only safe, but effectively blocked PCSK9 and therefore signficantly reduced bad cholesterol in healthy patients as well as those also taking the popular cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.

Earlier studies had shown this effect in primates, but this new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides the first clinical trial data for testing the drug on humans. This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research.

“Wars for PCSK9 are far bigger than the statin wars,"" said Dr. Evan A Stein, lead author of the study and researcher at the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. “This is a hot research area and everybody is so close together.""

Other companies including Amgen, Merck & Company, Novartis and Pfizer, are also hot on the trail developing their own PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. Stein said.

Additional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.

The REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.

A control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.

Stein characterized the results of the trial as “pretty dramatic.”

A PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins ""because it's unlike any other drug. With statins you get toxicity – with these drugs we don’t see any side effects with the antibody.”

In an accompanying editorial, authors Dr. Stephen G. Young, and Loren G. Fong, Ph.D. write: “At this point, the status of PCSK9 therapeutics appears to be full speed ahead. Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.”

However, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.

The cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say. But they also note that ""patients who cannot tolerate statins could benefit greatly.""

If the results are confirmed, “This is game changing science,” said Dr. Richard A. Stein, a spokesman for the American Heart Association who's not related to the study author or involved in the research.

Stein called the trial results “a very important breakthrough,"" while being careful to note that they represent early science which should be confirmed through larger and longer studies.

He said the study methodology was thorough because it included people with high cholesterol as well as people with genetic familial high cholesterol, which is proven to be a result of impaired PCSK9 genetic function.",Experimental cholesterol drug results called 'game changing',4,CNN

MONDAY, March 19, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- New research finds that a minimally invasive surgical procedure to treat hernias results in less chronic pain and a faster recovery when compared to a traditional approach.

One expert, however, said the older strategy may still be the best option in some cases.

""It's not one-size-fits-all,"" said Dr. L. Michael Brunt, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""One repair isn't appropriate for all circumstances.""

Hernias occur when part of an internal organ, such as the intestines, bulges out through muscle. At issue are the surgical approaches that physicians use when a patient suffers from a hernia in the groin.

The procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn't protrude again. ""It's as if you had a leak in a tire that's ballooned out,"" Brunt said. ""You'll patch it to prevent it from continuing to protrude.""

The study, led by researchers at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, examined two procedures.

One procedure, known as total extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty, is performed under a general anesthetic and uses a laparoscopic approach through a small opening. It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said.

The other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. It can be done under local anesthesia. The study authors didn't examine a third approach, known as ""patch and plug,"" he said.

In the study, researchers randomly assigned 660 hernia patients to one of the two surgical procedures. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55.

The researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.

Hernias recurred in 5 percent of laparoscopic and 8 percent of the traditional-procedure patients. Recurrences decreased to 0.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, if the procedures were performed by experienced surgeons.

After five years, 28 percent of those who had the traditional procedure reported chronic pain, compared to 15 percent of the laparoscopic group.

The study ""confirms what a lot of surgeons who do both procedures know already,"" Brunt said. ""There's less pain and a bit of a faster recovery from the laparoscopic procedure.""

Still, ""the vast majority of patients do well, regardless of the approach,"" he said.

Why use the traditional approach if the laparoscopic technique is better in some ways? The traditional approach may be appropriate when it's too risky to place patients under general anesthesia, Brunt said, such as in elderly patients and those with multiple health problems.

Brunt said the costs of the two procedures are comparable, although the laparoscopic procedure may cost more.

The findings appear in the March issue of the Archives of Surgery.

Researchers used a ''microfocused"" ultrasound to target the sweat glands in 14 men and women, aged 18 to 75, says Mark Nestor, MD, PhD, a dermatologist and voluntary associate professor of dermatology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

All had hyperhidrosis, a condition where a person sweats much more than the body needs to cool itself.

""Microfocused ultrasound appears to be effective and safe in the treatment of hyperhidrosis,"" Nestor says. It works, he says, by heating and destroying the sweat glands under the arm.

The sweating can occur even when the temperature is cool and the person is at rest. The armpits, palms, and soles are often affected.

He presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.

story_reviews_00898,"March 15, 2012 -- A new prescription gel may quickly treat a common precancerous skin condition called actinic keratosis, a new study shows.

The gel is derived from the sap of the Euphorbia peplus plant. This has long been used as a folk remedy for skin lesions.

The new findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Actinic keratoses are typically red, scaly skin lesions that can over time develop into a type of skin cancer. They can often be found on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, scalp, arms, and legs.

The new gel, Picato (ingenol mebutate), is applied once daily for two or three days, depending on the area being treated. Other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks, and often irritate the skin. Cryotherapy, or freezing the affected skin area, is also used but can sometimes leave a scar.

Because the new gel is only used for a few days, any irritation is usually short-lived. The short duration also makes people more likely to stay the course, another advantage, according to the study's authors.

“The shorter application period is what makes ingenol mebutate a breakthrough in the treatment of actinic keratosis,” researcher Mark Lebwohl, MD, says in a news release. He is a professor and chair of the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.

The new study included 547 people with actinic keratoses on their face or scalp and 458 people with these lesions on their mid-section or arms and legs. Half got the new gel and the other half received an inactive placebo.

At the end of the two-month study, 42% of people in the first group and 34% of those in the second group who got the new gel showed complete clearance of their lesions. By contrast, only 4% and 5%, respectively, of the people who received the placebo had complete clearance.

The good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do – or not do – in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.

But a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.

Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.

It's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.

First, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, ""The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.""

This tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, ""The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection."" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.

Why is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs – such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV – have been found in the prostate.

Participants in the study were asked about their family’s medical history, which may increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.

Circumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.

A few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.

This gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.

MONDAY, March 12, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- People taking popular cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins may have a slightly lower risk than others of developing Parkinson's disease, new research suggests.

This effect may be even more pronounced among people younger than 60, according to the study published in the March issue of Archives of Neurology.

However, the risk reduction was modest and may have been due to chance, the authors said, noting that more research is warranted, especially because statins can cause adverse side effects.

""There is no clear verdict,"" said Dr. Stuart Isaacson, director of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center of Boca Raton, who was not involved in the study.

""Right now we don't have any good evidence that there is anything we can do to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but research is ongoing,"" added Isaacson, also an associate professor of neurology at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami.

For the study, researchers led by Dr. Xiang Gao, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University School of Public Health in Boston, analyzed data on more than 38,000 men and almost 91,000 women enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Study in 1994.

During 12 years of follow-up, 644 people were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. People taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially those younger than 60, were less likely to develop the neurological disorder than those not using cholesterol drugs, the researchers found.

Nearly one million people in the United States have Parkinson's disease, a chronic and progressive movement disorder, and no one knows what causes it.

The researchers can't say exactly how -- or even if -- statins reduce the risk of Parkinson's. It's thought these drugs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects, which could protect the brain.

The study had some limitations, the authors acknowledged. For example, only about 70 percent of people who were taking drugs to lower cholesterol were actually on statins at the study's start.

Dr. Roy Alcalay, an assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, said it is way too early to say that statins lower risk for Parkinson's disease. ""This is a promising avenue for future research,"" said Alcalay, an advisor for the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.

But there is some good news, he added. The data are compelling evidence that statins are not detrimental for people with or at risk of Parkinson's disease, he said. There was a concern that statins could be harmful as they might lower the level of coenzyme Q10 in the blood. Co-Q10, an antioxidant, is thought to have benefits for people with Parkinson's disease.

""If you need to be on statins for your heart, it is not going to increase your risk for Parkinson's,"" Alcalay said.

story_reviews_00901,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Despite recent debate about how well antidepressants really work in people with only mild or moderate depression, a new analysis of drug studies suggests they may have some benefit across the board.

Researchers found that more patients taking Prozac or Effexor had a substantial improvement in their symptoms than those taking a drug-free placebo pill, regardless of how severe those symptoms were to begin with.

“The idea that unless you’re very, very ill, you’re not going to benefit from treatment does not appear to stand up” when looking closely, said the study’s lead author, Robert Gibbons, from the University of Chicago.

Still, not everyone in the studies improved — on average, about five people had to be treated with one of the drugs for one person to feel better, and the benefits seemed to be diminished among some of the oldest patients.

What’s more, one researcher not involved in the study said its findings still don’t mean the drugs are any better than non-drug methods of treating depression, such as talk therapy and being more physically active.

For their analysis, Gibbons and his colleagues looked at outcomes for each individual patient in published and unpublished trials testing the effects of six weeks of treatment with antidepressants versus placebo pills. Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor — Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.

They included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.

More adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.

Fifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.

The benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients’ symptoms were before starting treatment.

However, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.

“Clearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don’t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,” Gibbons told Reuters Health.

The findings, he added, “raise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what’s going on in the elderly?”

Both types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.

Some of the study’s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.

The researchers said they couldn’t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants — especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly — or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.

One recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)

Irving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn’t make him more optimistic about the drugs.

If five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don’t get much out of it, he pointed out.

“More than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug — either they’re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,” he told Reuters Health.

“There are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,” Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.

Still, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn’t insignificant.

“Definitely it doesn’t look like antidepressants are placebos,” he concluded.

story_reviews_00903,"In a bid to make cancer immunotherapy more effective, researchers report they have succeeded in halting the progress of aggressive melanoma in its tracks — at least briefly — in seven patients treated with an army of cloned cancer-fighting immune cells. In one of those patients, the treatment resulted in complete remission of his metastatic melanoma and evidence that his immune system stands ready to fight any return of the cancer after three years.

The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, contributes to hopes that a tumor-fighting strategy called immunotherapy can slow, halt or even reverse the growth of a range of cancers — and do so with fewer dangerous side effects.

Immunotherapy is one of medicine’s most promising — and most problematic — approaches to cancer treatment. It aims to charge up the patient’s immune system to attack cancer cells and halt their out-of-control growth.

The approach outlined in the new study by researchers from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle identifies several ways to make it better, said Dr. Cassian Yee, the study’s senior author. The key is to identify specific cancer-fighting cells already circulating in the blood of patients and make thousands of copies of them in the lab.

Advertisement

This type of “adoptive immunotherapy” could be effective against a wide range of cancers, Yee said. His research group is making plans to try the technique on patients with advanced ovarian cancer and sarcomas — rare tumors that arise from connective tissue in bones and muscle.

Several independent researchers said the study results were promising. But they also noted that the trial involved only 11 patients and said the therapy was less effective than in other published trials.

“Someday, cell-based therapy will be mainstream in cancer therapy,” said Dr. Jeff Miller of the University of Minnesota’s cell therapy core laboratory. “Each article that shows clinical activity is giving us a piece of the puzzle” that will make it safer and more effective, he said.

Immunotherapy usually starts with clinicians harvesting immune system cells called T cells that have attached themselves to a tumor in an effort to attack. They then coax the cells to multiply, either in the lab or in the body, and let them loose in the bloodstream so they can attack cancer wherever they find it.

Yee’s team tried to do this more precisely. The researchers hoped that by choosing T cells more selectively and cloning only those judged most likely to vanquish their foe, the treatment would be more effective. Sorting through the body’s vast and diverse population of T cells to select just the right ones is a painstaking process. But Yee bet that the extra effort would pay off with better results and fewer side effects.

Researchers drew blood from patients and scoured it to find the rare type of immune cell — a melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell — that specifically homes in on proteins expressed by the cancer. Then they put their harvest — as few as a few hundred cells — into a test tube and cloned them, creating millions. The last step was to infuse the resulting army of cancer-fighting clones back into the patient.

In six of the 11 patients in the trial, the melanoma stopped progressing for 12 to 19 weeks. Another patient was declared in remission because his cancer ceased to spread and, after several months, disappeared altogether. Three years later, researchers continue to detect the presence of the cloned cells they infused into the patient, 61-year-old high school history teacher Gardiner Vinnedge of North Bend, Wash.

For six years, Vinnedge endured painful rounds of chemotherapy, only to have his melanoma return. The immunotherapy allowed him to return to work three weeks after treatments began. The only side effect, he said, was a raging rash that lasted for three days.

“My back, my legs were just covered with a hot red rash,” Vinnedge said. “It meant the treatment was working — the war was on between my T cells and the melanin in my skin.” Now he says he is optimistic he may live to see retirement age, though he’s not sure he’ll ever stop teaching.

For immunotherapy to work, the manufactured T cells must survive for the months it takes to reach a tumor and dismantle it, as well as to round up migrating cancer cells and kill them. Currently, the T cells have limited staying power and often die off before their work is done. Doctors give them a boost by administering a growth factor called interleukin-2. But at high doses, it can cause dangerously low blood pressure, breathing problems, kidney failure and heart arrhythmias.

Yee’s group showed that by choosing T cells more selectively, patients can get by with much lower doses of interleukin-2, making the treatment less toxic.

The researchers also discovered another way to reduce their dependence on interleukin-2 — by selecting the most youthful T cells, which survived the longest when infused into patients.

Dr. Patrick Hwu of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston said the study “adds to the wealth of what we know” about using the body’s immune system to fight cancer. But immunotherapy pioneer Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg was highly critical of the methods and results.

“Cloned cells don’t work,” said Rosenberg, who heads the National Cancer Institute’s tumor immunology section. In larger immunotherapy trials that used cultured cancer-fighting immune cells taken from patients’ tumors, Rosenberg and his colleagues achieved “durable and complete regression” in as many as 40% as patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. “These results,” he said, “are inferior.”

North American allergy experts tell WebMD that although they find the preliminary findings fascinating, further study is needed before they would recommend the herbs. Yoshiteru Shimoide, MD, head of the Yoshiteru Shimoide Clinic of Internal Medicine in Kagoshima City, Japan, presented the results here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI).

Asthma on the Rise in U.S. The number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing. One in 12 people had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 in 2001, according to the CDC. There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says.

A professor speaks to Reuters about robotic surgery at Imperial College London October 24, 2008. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor

The analysis, which appeared in the Journal of Urology, compared increasingly common robotic surgery with two other techniques for the same surgery and found that direct costs can be up to several thousand dollars higher for the robotic type.

Touted as less invasive and more efficient, robotic surgeries typically use a laparoscopic or “keyhold surgery” approach, in which tools and a tiny video camera are inserted into the body through one or two small incisions.

Robotic surgery replaces a surgeon’s hands with ultra-precise tools at the ends of mechanical arms, all operated by the surgeon from a console.

“I think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,” said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.

Hu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques.

During the last three months of 2008 — the most recent data available that allowed a comparison among robotic, open and laparoscopic surgeries — more than half of all prostate removals involved robot-assisted surgery.

About three percent of prostate patients had standard laparoscopic surgery and 44 percent had open surgery. Open and laparoscopic surgeries were still more common than robotic surgeries for kidney repairs and removals.

Among patients who had their prostate removed, none died from laparoscopic or robotic surgery, whereas two out of every 1,000 died after the open procedure.

About five percent of the men who had open surgery needed a blood transfusion, compared to less than two percent of men who had robot-assisted surgery. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group.

The results were similar for people who had kidneys removed.

The trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery.

For kidney removal, robotic surgery cost $13,900, which was $2,700 more than laparoscopic and $1,300 more than open surgery.

David Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards. Emphasis should be lmited on procedure, he said, as opposed to surgical skill.

“Years ago, this was thought to be the be-all-end-all operation, particularly with prostate surgery. We were going to get patients out of the hospital quicker, have better potency and incontinence outcomes,” he told Reuters Health.

story_reviews_00906,"Food allergies are tricky business. They're on the rise in the United States and no one knows why.

Some children are allergic to many foods, and it's impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction. And so far there's no cure.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Duke University are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life-threatening reactions. It's still in the early stages, but Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins, who has been on the forefront of food allergy research, estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years.



In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. The strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen (milk). Oral immunotherapy, swallowing small amounts of the allergen, has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy, which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person's tongue.

Wood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. These kids were severely allergic to cow's milk. Wood presented the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology this weekend.

The results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy. Still, it did not eliminate all symptoms.

This is particularly important, because about 20% of the kids that Wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible, Wood said.

Some participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. But only one-third have longterm protection. Others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions.

""With milk that’s not too hard,"" Wood says, because one could ""eat pizza a couple of times a week.""

It's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. The big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding, Wood said.

This is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.

Other research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies. But tree nuts may be harder to treat, Wood said, because tree-nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can't eat.

Researchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Feb. 27, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Middle-aged and elderly adults who regularly eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may slow the mental decline that leads to dementia, according to a new study.

Researchers found that people with the highest blood levels of these essential fatty acidsfound in fish such as salmon and tunawere more likely to perform well on tests of mental functioning and to experience less age-related brain shrinkage.

""We feel fatty-acid consumption exerts a beneficial effect on brain aging by promoting vascular health,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Zaldy Tan, associate professor at the Easton Center for Alzheimer's Disease Research and the division of geriatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles. This might include reducing blood pressure and inflammation, he added.

Previous research linked dementia risk with the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in blood plasma, which reflects how much people had eaten in the past few days. But in the current work, researchers could estimate the amount of omega-3s that participants had consumed in the past several months by looking at how much had built up in their red blood cells.

""This represents their average intake of fatty acids, not just a snapshot,"" Tan said.

The study, published in the Feb. 28 issue of the journal Neurology, did not prove that omega-3 fatty acids prevent mental decline, merely that there may be an association between consumption of fatty acids and brain health.

For the study, researchers measured the red blood cell level of fatty acids in 1,575 dementia-free people whose average age was 67. About three months later, participants underwent mental-functioning tests and MRI scans that examined brain size and blood supply in the brain.

The participants were in the Framingham Offspring Study, which is predominately white. Whether the association would apply to other ethnic and racial groups needs to be explored, the authors said.

The researchers found that those with the lowest levels of omega-3s had worse scores on tests of visual memory, attention and abstract thinking than people who ranked in the top 75 percent for fatty-acid levels.

Adults in the bottom 25 percent also tended to have smaller brain volume overall. The decrease in brain volume was enough to make their brains appear two years older than those of people in the top three-quarters for fatty-acid levels.

Brain scans also showed signs of less blood supply in the brains of people with the lowest omega-3 levels. This suggests they may play a role in promoting general vascular, or blood vessel, health in the brain, similar to how they are thought to help heart health, rather than acting on just one brain area, Tan said.

The researchers took into account various health and lifestyle factors, including age, education and body mass index, to explore whether other differences among the people with low levels of omega-3s could help explain their more rapid brain aging.

But after controlling for those risk factors, ""the difference [in brain aging] is still there so we conclude that omega-3 fatty acids likely explain them,"" Tan said.

Tan added, however, that it remains possible that factors they did not control for, such as fruit and vegetable consumption, are really responsible for the brain benefits. Another possibility is that the slight mental decline that the people in the older brain group were experiencing caused them to eat less healthy omega-3-rich foods, instead of vice versa.

""This is a strengthening of the argument that people with less [omega-3 fatty acids] have higher risk of dementia,"" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.

But questions remain over whether fatty-acid levels really influence changes in brain size, Scarmeas added. A clinical trial comparing high and low intake of omega-3s in relation to brain imaging would help answer those questions, he said.

In the meantime, fish is ""a good prescription for other things and we have a hint it might be helpful for the brain,"" Scarmeas said.

That the current study reported a difference in brain health between people with omega-3 fatty-acid levels in the bottom 25 percent and top 75 percent suggests that there is a threshold level of consumption to attain brain gains.

A previous study in which participants filled out food surveys found decreased risk of vascular brain problems among those who ate at least three servings of fish a week.

Omega-3s may help retain brainpower

THE QUESTION Eating fish can be good for the heart, thanks to the presence of omega-3 fatty acids. Might fish consumption help the brain, too?

THIS STUDY involved 1,575 adults who averaged 67 years old and had no signs of dementia and had not had a stroke. They were given MRI brain scans and a battery of tests to measure memory and thinking abilities; they also had blood drawn to check the level of omega-3 fatty acids in their red blood cells. Those with the lowest levels of omega-3s showed signs of accelerated aging. They had lower brain volume, indicating shrinkage comparable to two additional years of aging. Compared with those with the highest blood levels of omega-3s, they scored lower on cognitive tests measuring such things as memory, problem solving, abstract thinking and multi-tasking.

WHO MAY BE AFFECTED? Middle-aged and older adults. Omega-3 fatty acids are unsaturated fats found in most fish, but especially in fatty fish that live in cold seawater, such as salmon and herring. Except for trout, freshwater fish usually are lower in omega-3s.

CAVEATS Most participants were white. Testing and measurements were done once, providing no data for comparison over time or to determine any link to dementia.

story_reviews_00910,"People with diets short on omega-3 fatty acids – the kind found in fish oil – were more likely to experience accelerated brain aging, a new study found.

“People with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids had lower brain volumes that were equivalent to about two years of brain aging,” said Dr. Zaldy S. Tan, a member of the UCLA Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research in the Department of Neurology.

The study was published Tuesday in the print edition of the journal Neurology.

Tan and his colleagues compared blood levels of two nutrients in omega-3 fatty acids with MRI brain scans and cognitive tests. They found people in the bottom 25% scored lower on such mental tests as problem solving, multi-tasking and abstract thinking.

Tan said the MRI images showed those with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids were also more likely to have minute but significant structural changes in the brain. The MRIs showed higher white matter hyperintensity volume, tiny lesions in the brain, raising the risk for death, stroke and dementia for the low omega-3 fatty acids group.

Tan said the results were consistent with signs of damage to the intricate network of blood vessels in the brain. A third of the brain by volume is composed of blood vessels.

Tan’s team studied 1,575 people with an average age of 67 who were free of dementia. They controlled for such risk factors as age, smoking, gender, body mass index, physical activity and APOE, the one known gene linked to dementia risk.

Tan said the next step in the research is to follow these people to see if the risk factors they observed translates into a higher rate of cognitive deterioration.

Fatty fish like salmon offer a concentrated source of the omega-3 fatty acid nutrients Tan and his colleagues looked at eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Vegetable and canola oils, soybeans, flaxseed, walnuts and vegetables including spinach, kale and salad greens are also a source of omega-3 fatty acids. These contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which the body partially converts to EPA and DHA.

Both types are thought to be beneficial. The typical American diet doesn't contain enough of either. Choose My Plate, the government’s dietary guidelines, recommends eating seafood twice a week.

“This is an important new finding that supports omega-3 for brain health and brain size,” said Dr. Majid Fotuhi, chairman of the Neurology Institute for Brain Health and Fitness and assistant professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Fotuhi recommends his patients get 1,000 mg per day of DHA, a nutrient that increases blood flow in the brain, reduces inflammation in the brain, heart and elsewhere, and reduces the toxic aggregation of amyloid in the brain.

DHA has the added benefit of improving mood and reducing symptoms of depression, he said. The only people who should avoid DHA are patients on a blood thinner like Cumadin, he added.

TUESDAY, Feb. 28, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Menstrual cramps are the bane of many women, but new research suggests that a form of vitamin D may one day be added to the meager list of pain relievers for the sometimes disabling condition.

A small study in Italy found that a single, high dose of cholecalciferol -- also known as vitamin D3 -- was linked to a marked reduction in menstrual cramps, with the largest benefits observed in women reporting the most pain at the beginning of the study.

U.S. experts cautioned that it's too early to recommend vitamin D3 to those experiencing cramps -- estimated to occur in at least half of all reproductive-age women -- because the study didn't delve into possible long-term risks of taking high doses.

""It's provocative in the fact that the results are pretty amazing,"" said Dr. Robert Graham, an internist and vitamin D expert at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""But the dose [given] is a lot more than conventionally given for any condition.""

The study was published Feb. 27 in the Archives of Internal Medicine.

In the study, 40 Italian women were split into two groups: one receiving a single oral dose of 300,000 IUs of vitamin D3 and the other getting a placebo five days before the expected start of their menstrual periods.

After two months, average pain scores dropped 41 percent for women assigned vitamin D treatment, while no difference in pain was reported in the placebo group.

Also, the women who took vitamin D reported no need to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as the pain reliever ibuprofen, to manage their pain in the two-month study period, while 40 percent of those assigned to placebo reported using an NSAID at least once.

Menstrual cramps, known by the medical name dysmenorrhea, typically begin just before or at the start of a woman's menstrual period and can last several days. Experts attribute the pelvic pain to prostaglandins, a hormone-like substance that contributes to the contraction and relaxation of muscles and blood vessels.

Vitamin D3 apparently helped hamper prostaglandin production in study participants, easing their pain, said Dr. Jill Rabin, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. The vitamin is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects, Rabin added.

""The bottom line is, it looked like it worked,"" said Rabin, also head of urogynecology at the hospital. ""It was a very well-done study, but my comment is, it was one study. It asks more questions than it answers, which is the sign of a good trial.""

The 300,000 IU dose of vitamin D3 given in the study also far exceeds the daily intake of 600 IUs recommended for American women of reproductive age, both Graham and Rabin said. And since the study period lasted only two months, there was no way to tell whether such a high dose produced any toxic long-term effects.

Currently used methods of controlling menstrual cramps include NSAIDs and -- among those with severe pain -- birth control pills. But both have potential risks: NSAID users can experience stomach or kidney troubles, for example, while birth control pills are linked to blood clots in certain women. The cost of vitamin D supplements would be roughly comparable with both of these remedies.

Vitamin D use has also been widely studied as a possible preventive for many other conditions, including heart disease, certain cancers and autoimmune disorders.

The Italian study participants all had blood levels of vitamin D measuring in the lowest 25 percent of normal at the study's outset, although the researchers didn't report the womens' blood levels afterward. Experts wondered if women with higher blood levels would experience such dramatic cramp relief as observed in the study.

Graham and Rabin agreed that much larger trials should be done before they would recommend vitamin D3 use to any of their patients for cramp relief.

""From a symptomatic standpoint, it's something to be considered, but more studies are needed to see the risks and benefits,"" Graham said. ""Studies like this are starting to show that vitamin D is ubiquitous in receptors in our bodies . . . but it needs further explanation.""

SUNDAY, Feb. 26, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug improves patients' blood sugar control without increasing the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in patients with type 2 diabetes, according to the results of a phase 2 clinical trial.

Type 2 diabetes is the more prevalent form of the disease, accounting for about 90 percent of cases. Often tied to obesity, type 2 diabetes involves a gradual decline in how insulin responds to changes in blood sugar (glucose).

The new drug, called TAK-875, is a pill designed to enhance the secretion of insulin in response to such changes, which means that it has no effect on insulin secretion when blood sugar levels are normal -- potentially reducing the risk for hypoglycemia.

The trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin.

The patients were randomly assigned to receive either TAK-875 (303 patients), placebo (61 patients), or another diabetes drug called glimepiride (brand named Amaryl).

The study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical (which is developing the drug), and appears online Feb. 26 in The Lancet.

After 12 weeks, all the patients taking the different doses of TAK-875 had significant drops in their blood sugar levels, the researchers said. A similar reduction occurred in patients taking glimepiride.

However, the incidence of episodes of hypoglycemia was much lower among patients taking TAK-875 (2 percent) than among those taking glimepiride (19 percent) and the same as those taking the placebo (2 percent).

The incidence of treatment-related side effects was 49 percent among patients taking TAK-875, 48 percent among those in the placebo group, and 61 percent among those in the glimepiride group, according to the researchers. They write that they are ""excited about the potential of TAK-875 and are eager to conduct larger trials to find out how well this drug works, how safe it is and what its place is in the treatment of diabetes.""

In a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, ""on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875],"" including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues.

Other diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings.

Dr. Loren Wissner Greene is clinical associate professor of endocrinology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. She noted that glitazones -- a separate class of newer drugs such as Rezulin, Avandia and Actos that also target insulin resistance -- have all shown initial promise in clinical trials before worrisome side effects began to surface in users (due to concerns around heart risks, Avandia remains on the U.S. market but under limited distribution).

As for TAK-875, it targets a separate mechanism ""but again, until more is known about short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects, we need to proceed with moderated enthusiasm for each new drug and drug mechanism,"" Wissner Greene said.

Dr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, ""given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents.""

She said that, ""though this study includes a small sample size followed for a short period of time, the results are promising in that TAK-875 appears to be effective for glycemic [blood sugar] control without significant risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain. However, like Wissner-Greene, Sood said that ""further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients.""

When it comes to infertility, the burden seems to often fall on women. They’re poked and prodded and scoped in an effort to figure out what’s complicating conception.

While it’s just as likely that infertility is related to the male half of the couple, only 20% of men in duos struggling to make a baby get a sperm-count analysis early on or at all, according to data from SpermCheck Fertility, which earlier this month announced the availability of its at-home screening test for men. SpermCheck, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, assesses sperm count with 98% accuracy in 10 minutes and does away with the unpleasantness of conjuring up a sperm sample in a doctor’s office. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. These tests can be expensive (costing hundreds of dollars and not typically covered by insurance), inconvenient and are often embarrassing.”

Low sperm count, or oligospermia, is a main cause of male infertility. By addressing the issue, SpermCheck will join a crowded infertility market that includes more than 20 types of female-fertility tests in Walgreen stores alone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits.

“In our society, the woman carries the burden of trying to determine the issues surrounding infertility,” Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, told Bloomberg News. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.

The test reveals whether sperm count appears normal, at 20 million or more sperm per ml; lower than that indicates a trip to the doctor is pretty much unavoidable. Stores will begin stocking the $39.99 test in April; until then, men — or their partners — can find it online at www.Walgreens.com and www.CVS.com.

It relies on scrutiny of a particular protein found only in the head of mature sperm; the protein was discovered by John Herr, director of the Center of Cell Biology at the University of Virginia and the chairman of SpermCheck. “This at-home test was created to meet the needs of couples who are considering and just planning on starting a family, those currently having trouble conceiving,” says Herr, and “even those men who are just curious about their sperm count.”

Would-be virile men “just curious” about their sperm count? Hard to believe. And yet, assuming fertility aids of some sort successfully pave the way to parenthood, SpermCheck could also prove of some use at the other end of the spectrum: the company also manufactures a do-it-yourself test for postvasectomy screening.

story_reviews_00914,"A new report highlights a novel way for doctors to replace thinning hairlines: transplanting leg hair.

The report, a study of two cases published in The Archives of Dermatology, describes a new procedure in which receding hairlines were restored by taking hair follicles from patients’ legs and grafting them to the head. Men’s leg hair had successfully been transplanted before to the back of the head, but these are believed to be the first documented cases of leg hair being used to restore the hairline.

The procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness, the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress. The condition, also called androgenic alopecia, typically begins at the hairline and eventually creates a horseshoe-shaped pattern of hair around the ears. It stems from a sensitivity — largely genetic — to the effects of hormones on hair follicles.

In traditional transplants, hair follicles are taken from an area that runs an inch or two above the ears and temples to the back of the head. Dermatologists can transplant follicles from this area – called the safe donor zone because hair follicles there are impervious to the hormones that cause hair loss – to the front of the head without worrying that the hair that grows from them will fall out. But hair that comes from the back of the head is typically much coarser than the fine hair that grows in front.

“If you look at a natural hairline, it’s very soft, like baby hair,” said Dr. Sanusi Umar, an associate instructor of dermatology at the medical school of the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the new report. “The back of the head is where you find the thickest hair on the head. If you take that hair and use it in the hairline, it can end up looking harsh and pluggy, because the hair is too thick.”

Dr. Umar was inspired to develop the procedure in part from personal experience. In 1996, as a medical internist with thinning hair, he underwent a traditional hair transplant procedure but was unhappy with the results. “That inspired me to go into dermatology,” he said. After reading a 2008 report showing it was possible for transplanted leg hair to survive and grow naturally on the back of a man’s head, Dr. Umar realized its potential to create softer, more natural-looking hairlines. “If you transplant leg hair on the head, it’s not going to start acting like head hair. It will still grow shorter and slower than scalp hair,” he said.

At his clinic in Redondo Beach, Calif., Dr. Umar tried the technique on two patients, one a 35-year-old man who was embarrassed by the results of a traditional hair transplant to restore his hairline. “He was self-conscious about the problem and resorted to styling his hair forward to obscure the hairline,” Dr. Umar wrote in his report. The other patient, a 29-year-old man who had also undergone a traditional transplant, was likewise “unhappy about his hairline, which he felt was too harsh and straight,” Dr. Umar wrote. “He had resorted to cropping his hair short to obscure the problem.”

With the patients under local anesthesia, Dr. Umar used a device that creates microscopic wounds around hair follicles in the back of the leg; the follicles were then removed and transplanted to the hairline. The hairs were removed in a diffuse pattern, so there were no bald spots on the legs after the procedure. “Because these are very tiny wounds, they heal and close up with minimal scarring,” he said.

In each case, Dr. Umar and his team extracted about 1,000 leg hair follicles and grafted them, one by one, to the patients’ hairlines. About 75 to 80 percent of the transplanted leg hair grew successfully on the patients’ heads after the operations, and both men were happy with the results, Dr. Umar said. “The hairline was fully grown and soft-looking by nine months” in the 35-year-old, he wrote, “at which time the patient started combing his hair backward and sporting a ponytail, exposing his hairline comfortably.”

Since then, Dr. Umar has done eight more of the procedures, including one in a woman. On average, a procedure involves 1,500 to 1,800 follicles and takes about eight hours, with breaks.

A lot of these patients “have no other options or alternatives,” he added. “They’ve been told to forget about it by many other clinics. It’s life-altering for them when they realize that this is possible.”",A New Approach to Treating Hair Loss,1,New York Times

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 22, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Breast cancers in women aged 40 to 49 that are diagnosed by mammograms have a better prognosis than those detected by doctors or the women themselves, a new study indicates.

""They have an earlier diagnosis, earlier stage, better prognosis,"" said study author Judith Malmgren, an affiliated professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine. She is also president of HealthStat Consulting Inc. in Seattle.

The new study, like previous ones, re-ignites the ongoing debate about the best age to start routine mammograms and the best screening interval. It appears in the March issue of the journal Radiology.

In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued mammogram recommendations. It recommends women aged 50 to 74 who are at average risk for breast cancer have a mammogram done every two years. It also suggests that women aged 40 to 49 at average risk discuss the pros and cons with their doctors and decide on an individual basis if and when to start screening.

Meanwhile, other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, recommend women begin mammograms at age 40 and continue to have them annually.

Malmgren and her colleagues evaluated nearly 2,000 women who had breast cancer. All were aged 40 to 49 when they were treated between 1990 and 2008.

The researchers looked at the method of diagnosis, whether by mammogram or if the cancer was found by the doctor or the woman. They also took these into account: the cancer's stage at diagnosis; type of treatment; annual follow-up; recurrence; and survival.

Over the 18-year period, the number of breast cancers diagnosed at very early stages increased 66 percent, while the number of more advanced cancers (stage 3) decreased by 66 percent.

Those whose cancers were detected by mammogram rose from 28 percent in 1990 to 58 percent in 2008. The number of cancers detected by doctor or patients declined from 73 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2008.

Women whose cancers were detected by mammograms were more likely than the doctor- or patient-detected cancers to have lumpectomy or other breast-conserving surgery: 67 percent vs. 48 percent. The women whose cancers were detected by mammograms were less likely to be given chemotherapy.

While 4 percent of women whose cancer was found on mammogram died during a follow-up period that ranged from one to 20 years, 11 percent of those whose cancers were found by the doctor or the women died.

When the researchers looked only at invasive cancers, 92 percent of the women whose cancer was found on mammogram survived without recurrence at five years; 88 percent of the other group did.

""I don't think the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is looking at the whole picture,"" Malmgren said. ""They are concentrating on the harms.""

Among them, according to the 2009 guidelines, are false-positives, which can lead to anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.

Malmgren, a breast cancer survivor, says more focus should be placed on the benefit of early diagnosis, because it often means less treatment is needed.

There was a decrease found in cancers being diagnosed at later stages in those whose cancers were found on mammograms. ""That's where the money is,"" Malmgren said.

Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, reviewed the study. ""The findings make sense,"" she said.

They found that cancers can be detected earlier by mammogram. ""A screening test, if it can't find something earlier than [by] clinical presentation, is a poor test,"" she said.

However, she said, the study does not provide support for all women aged 40 to 49 to have routine mammograms.

When considering its recommendation, the task force took all available evidence into account, including published studies, Moyer noted. ""The data from randomized trials and modeling show there is a very modest improvement in mortality with mammograms from 40 to 49,"" she said.

""Because it is so modest and there are risks, people need to make their own decision,"" Moyer said.

story_reviews_00916,"For women in their 50s and 60s, the benefits of getting regular mammograms clearly outweigh the risks. But the picture isn't so clear for women in their 40s.

""What we are seeing is that women with mammogram -detected breast cancer require less treatment,"" Malmgren tells WebMD. ""They get more breast -conserving surgery and less chemotherapy .""

The finding comes from a careful study of nearly 2,000 women diagnosed with first-time breast cancer at age 40 to 49. The women were carefully followed since their diagnosis in 1990 to 2008, says study co-leader Judith A. Malmgren, PhD, president of Seattle's HealthStat Consulting.

Feb. 22, 2012 -- When women in their 40s get breast cancer , their tumors need less intense treatment and recur less often if they were first detected during routine mammogram screening.

Mammograms in 40s

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) says there is no proof that the benefits of routine mammogram screening outweigh the risks for average-risk women in their 40s. The American Cancer Society (ACS) still recommends that women start screening in their 40s -- but only if they are fully aware of the possible harms as well as the possible benefits.

Even the USPSTF accepts the fact that beginning breast cancer screening at age 40 saves lives. It cuts the death rate in these women by about 15%, says Otis Brawley, MD, chief medical officer for the ACS.

""Let's say 10,000 women in the world were going to die of breast cancer that developed in their 40s,"" Brawley tells WebMD. ""If all those women were screened in their 40s, only 8,500 would die.""

But the vast majority of women will never develop breast cancer during their 40s. These women will suffer the harms of early screening.

""The issue is, how many women are going to have to be called back because of abnormal mammogram findings?"" Brawley says. ""How many women are going to end up getting biopsies and then learn they don't have breast cancer? And a certain proportion of women are going to be so inconvenienced so many times with the mammograms they got in their 40s that they will walk away from it in their 50s and 60s when it is a much better test.""",New Mammogram Benefits for Women in Their 40s,2,Cancer

Animal studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-cancer effects, but the results from human epidemiological studies have been inconclusive. For this case-control study, researchers recruited 5,307 colonoscopy patients, 60 percent of them men, at two Tennessee hospitals over a seven-year period ending in April 2010. The analysis appears online in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

They found 2,141 people with polyps, leaving 3,166 polyp-free controls. All patients were interviewed about diet, health habits and medical history.

After controlling for age, race, body mass index, smoking and other factors, the researchers found that women in the highest fifth for omega-3 consumption — those who consumed three or more servings of fish a week — were 33 percent less likely than women in the lowest fifth to have adenomatous polyps, a type likely to become cancerous.

The researchers found no effect in men, and no effect of omega-3 consumption on hyperplastic polyps, which are more likely to be benign.

Avoiding germs entirely would require something like solitary confinement or a head-to-toe application of Purell. As an alternative, many people try to do what they can to strengthen their immune systems. Vitamin C is old news, and echinacea and other herbs haven’t really panned out. But there’s a livelier option: probiotic supplements that supposedly fortify the immune system.

Each capsule of Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity from ReNew Life Formulas Inc. of Clearwater, Fla., contains 10 billion cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. Users are instructed to take two capsules a day with a light meal. A bottle of 30 capsules, sold at Whole Foods and many other health food stores, costs about $30.

A capsule of Probiotic Immunity from New Chapter Inc., based in Brattleboro, Vt., contains 1 billion each of 10 different organisms, including Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, two species of bacteria often found in yogurt. Other ingredients include herbs such as cumin, ginger and spinach. Users are instructed to take two capsules each day, preferably one in the morning and one in the evening, on an empty stomach. You can buy a bottle of 90 capsules for about $20 at many health food stores.

The claims

The website for Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity says that it “provides seasonal immune support” and “enhances respiratory health and immunity.” Put together, the statements seem to imply the product improves immunity against seasonal respiratory infections. But senior vice president of marketing Brian Colin says that the company cannot legally claim to prevent or treat any disease, including the cold and flu. Instead, he says that Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity can “promote overall immune health.”

The website for Probiotic Immunity says that the product “helps promote optimal digestive and immune system function.” A brochure provided by the company said that the supplement offers “live probiotics for optimal immune health.” As with Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity, users are left to themselves to speculate exactly which illnesses their newly optimal immune system might be fighting off.

The bottom line

It may seem odd, but there’s no doubt that a capsule full of live yeast or bacteria could help stimulate the immune system and potentially ward off illness, says Paul Forsythe, a respiratory specialist and assistant professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

But, as Forsythe noted in an April 2011 issue of the journal Chest, most of the research on probiotics has been conducted in mice, and the real-world immunity benefits for humans are uncertain. Companies “are taking evidence from animal studies and stretching their claims,” he says.

Still, Forsythe sees some room for hope that the right probiotic could make the cold and flu season a little less miserable. “There is some evidence that certain strains [of probiotics] can reduce the severity and duration of a cold.”

A September 2011 Cochrane Review of 14 studies found “weak” evidence that probiotics could help prevent the common cold and other upper respiratory infections in infants, children and younger adults. And an April 2011 study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a Lactobacillus probiotic seemed to improve the immune system’s response following a flu vaccination.

Dr. Sonia Michail, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, says the basic idea behind so-called immunity-boosting probiotics makes sense. As she explains, the gut is a major front in the immune system’s war against pathogens, and the immune cells there must respond to the resident bacteria. If helpful bacteria can activate immune cells in the gut, the disease fighters will spread throughout the body.

But according to Michail, studies suggest that, for unknown reasons, only some people — perhaps as few as 1 in 30 — could hope to avoid a cold by taking probiotics. And, she adds, the evidence for even this modest benefit “is far from robust.”

Forsythe says that probiotics are generally safe and might be worth a try, if only for the extra peace of mind. He adds that if he were going to try a product, he’d choose one with only a single strain.

One other thing: “I wouldn’t waste my money on anything expensive,” he says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption M. Spencer Green/AP M. Spencer Green/AP

Tammy Wade knew she had to try something else to lose weight when she stepped on the scale and saw the number: 203 pounds.

Wade, 50, of McCalla, Ala., is only 5 feet 3 inches tall. She had tried everything. Nothing worked.

""I had problems with my feet and ankles, and they were saying I was borderline diabetic,"" Wade says. ""I'm like, well, I gotta do something, you know. So, I needed, really did need to lose the weight.""

So Wade volunteered to help test Qnexa, an experimental drug pending before the Food and Drug Administration. She quickly noticed a big difference.

""I didn't feel ravenous, and I didn't want to snack all day long,"" she says.

Over the next year, Qnexa helped Wade slowly drop about 40 pounds, and keep it off for another year. ""It makes you feel so much better,"" Wade says. ""Your back don't hurt, your feet don't hurt.""

But the FDA rejected Qnexa in 2010 because of concerns about side effects, especially possible heart problems and birth defects.

FDA Briefing Documents Released Update Feb. 17, 10:30 a.m.: The FDA posted a 200-page review of the possible risks and benefits of Qnexa on the agency's website. The review noted continued concerns that Qnexa can increase the risk for several possible side effects, including increased heart rate, birth defects and thinking problems such as memory lapses and confusion. But the agency also noted Qnexa does appear to help many people lose at 5 percent of their body weight, In addition, it was ""somewhat reassuring"" that the drug also appears to produce some health benefits beyond weight loss, including lower blood pressure. Among the questions the agency plans to ask an advisory committee meeting Feb. 22 to review the drug, is whether Vivus Inc., which makes Qnexa, should conduct a study better assessing the drug's affect on the heart before the drug is approved. In its own 166-page review, Vivus called Qnexa a ""significant advancement in the medical treatment of obesity"" and detailed the potential benefits of the drug. The company also outlined a plan to minimize the chances that women of childbearing age would take it.

Qnexa's rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight-loss drugs. The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs.

Even though obesity is at epidemic levels, the FDA hasn't approved any new weight-loss medicines since 1999.

""We have two-thirds of all Americans who are overweight or obese, and the costs are nearing $150 billion a year,"" says Christine Ferguson, a health policy professor at George Washington University. ""The sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have.""

Ferguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts, anti-obesity advocates, government officials and others to try to figure out what the FDA should do.

""We actually have this huge gap,"" says Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, who has been participating in the meetings. ""We go from Weight Watchers to bariatric surgery. And the fact that there isn't ... medical treatments for obesity, including pharmaceuticals, really is a challenge, considering how big the problem is in this country.""

Part of what's going on is that the FDA has gotten a lot more cautious about approving new drugs in general after some serious drug-safety problems, such as heart problems linked to the painkiller Vioxx.

The FDA has been especially tough on weight-loss drugs because of previous problems with those drugs, such as the diet drug cocktail fen-phen.

""There's been a long history with obesity drugs that we've had to take off the market. You recall the fen-phen episode where a significant number of people got heart-valve defects,"" says Janet Woodcock, a top FDA official.

Woodcock argues that the agency has to be extra-careful with weight-loss drugs, because chances are it won't just be obese people taking them.

""When you're talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of Americans, there has to be attention to safety,"" Woodcock says.

What might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says.

But some say the agency's aversion to accepting any risks is outdated. They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills — something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.

""We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We're talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,"" Nadglowski says.

So Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.

Woodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.

As the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.

Barbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.

""We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,"" she says.

Vivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.

Some see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.

For her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again. She's gained back half of the weight she lost.

""I need to lose 20 more pounds again,"" she says. ""And I need the help.""",Weight-Loss Drugs Face High Hurdles At FDA,3,Diet studies

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- The quit-smoking drug Chantix may also help problem drinkers cut their alcohol consumption, a small new study suggests.

Exactly how this drug curbs drinking is not fully understood, but its use may increase blood pressure, heart rate and feelings of sadness and nausea, thereby blunting the pleasurable effects of alcohol, the researchers said.

""Chantix might reduce alcohol consumption by reducing overall enjoyment of the alcohol drinking experience,"" said study author Emma Childs, a research associate at the University of Chicago.

""Chantix increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol, for example feeling drowsy and irritable, [and] participants also reported that they didn't like the alcohol effects as much,"" Childs said.

Approved to help smokers quit in 2006, Chantix (varenicline) has its share of potential side effects. In July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated that Chantix carry a ""black box"" warning about the potential risks of depression and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the drug was linked to a small but significant risk of heart attack and stroke among people with pre-existing heart disease. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill.

The results of the new study were released online in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research prior to publication in the May print issue.

The study included 15 healthy participants who took part in six sessions. They received a 2-mg dose of Chantix and an inactive placebo, followed three hours later by a beverage containing either a placebo, a low dose of alcohol, or a high dose of alcohol.

Before and after the sessions, the researchers asked the participants about their mood, tested visual ability and measured physiological responses such as blood pressure and heart rate.

The participants found the Chantix-booze combination increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol and reduced the rewarding aspects of drinking.

Whether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation.

""We are not currently performing any studies with Chantix, although other groups are actively pursuing this line of research with a view to developing Chantix as an aid to people wanting to quit or cut down their drinking,"" Childs said.

Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and director of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, termed the study encouraging.

Noting that new ways of treating alcoholism are much needed, Salloum said that Chantix may have a niche among smokers with alcohol-dependence issues. ""We need a lot more options in terms of medicines to help curb drinking,"" he said. ""We have many options for depression and need more for alcoholism, considering it is one of the most common diseases around the world.""

More research is needed, he noted, but ""this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers.""

The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

story_reviews_00921,"We've long known that the Mediterranean diet is good for the heart. Now, it may be good for the brain as well.

A study published in this month's issue of the Archives of Neurology found that the diet might protect against blood-vessel damage in the brain, reducing the risks of stroke and memory loss.

It's the first study to specifically examine the effects of the diet centered around vegetables, fruits, fish, whole grains, nuts, olive oil and a moderate amount of alcohol, with limited consumption of red meat, sweets and refined grains like white bread or white rice—on the brain's small blood vessels.

Previous studies have suggested adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

In the latest study, researchers, led by a group at the University of Miami in Florida and Columbia University in New York, analyzed food questionnaires filled out by nearly 1,000 people participating in a larger, ongoing Northern Manhattan Study. These participants were categorized into groups based on how closely they adhered to an ideal Mediterranean-style diet, said Clinton Wright, one of the researchers and an associate professor of neurology at Miami's Miller School of Medicine.

Researchers then used magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans of the brain to look for what are called white matter hyperintensities, which show up as small lesions on the scan and indicate damage to small blood vessels. The damaged blood vessels can cause small so-called silent strokes with no immediate symptoms but which over time can affect cognitive performance.

Broadly, the study showed that people with the highest Mediterranean diet scores had the lowest white-matter volume burden.

Researchers also found that the type of fat appeared to matter. Those who consumed more monounsaturated fat, which is found in olive oil, had lower white-matter hyperintensity volumes on their brain scans.

Dr. Wright cautioned that the study doesn't prove that a Mediterranean-style diet causes less brain damage and said more study is needed. But he said it indicates that the diet might be protective of small blood vessels in the brain.

story_reviews_00922,"A patient's own heart cells can be used to regrow new heart tissue and help undo damage caused by a heart attack, according to early research published on Monday.

Scientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore were able to treat 17 heart attack patients with cells grown from their own heart tissue. Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.

When a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn't conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.



""This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,"" says Dr. Eduardo Marbán, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.

He says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander's new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.

Marbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.

To qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and ""had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren't squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,"" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

A total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one's own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.

In an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient's heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient's heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marbán, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.

About four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.

Marbán says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.

Six months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marbán says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. ""That was unprecedented"" he says. ""No one had demonstrated that before.""

All patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marbán says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.

Marbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] ""22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,"" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).

Patients in the control group, those who didn't get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.

Sonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.

""By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients."" Skarlatos says.

She was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.

Skarlatos also says it's still not clear exactly what is making the heart regenerate and scar tissue disappear. Is it the cells themselves or proteins and other factors produced by these newly introduced cells that help fix the heart? Further research will hopefully also help answer those questions, she says. The study authors say based on these results, further research is warranted.

Marbán, who began his research at Johns Hopkins, says ""we did see a glimmer [of regeneration] in animal testing,"" but the results in humans were much better. ""That doesn't usually happen this way in research.""",Patient's own stem cells help heal heart,4,CNN

The finding, just in time for Valentine's Day, is the clearest evidence yet that literally broken hearts can heal. All that's needed is a little help from one's own heart stem cells.

""We have been trying as doctors for centuries to find a treatment that actually reverses heart injury,"" Eduardo Marban, MD, PhD, tells WebMD. ""That is what we seem to have been able to achieve in this small number of patients. If so, this could change the nature of medicine. We could go to the root of disease and cure it instead of just work around it.""

Marban, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, led the study. He invented the ""cardiosphere"" culture technique used to create the stem cells and founded the company developing the treatment.

It's the first completed, controlled clinical trial showing that scarred heart tissue can be repaired. Earlier work in patients with heart failure, using different stem cells or bone-marrow stem cells, also showed that the heart can regenerate itself.

story_reviews_00924,"New treatment deep freezes ovarian tumors

A promising approach for treating advanced ovarian cancer offers new hope for extending survival rates and for preventing tumors from recurring, according to a study presented at last month's International Symposium on Endovascular Therapy in Miami.

Researchers at Wayne State University, working with Detroit's Karmanos Cancer Institute, treated ovarian cancer patients with cryoablation, a method that ""freeze destroys"" tumors throughout the body. These tumors were those that had returned following an initial surgical removal and follow-up treatment with procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation.

Survival rates using cryoablation were about 60 months, which is comparable to the survival rates for women whose tumors do not return after the first surgical procedure. However, about 80 percent of women who first treat their tumors with surgery do eventually experience a recurrence, according to Hyun J. Bang, MD, a radiology resident at Wayne State University.

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of cancers that affect the female reproductive system, with about 22,000 women diagnosed each year and, in 2011, approximately 15,460 deaths. ""Unfortunately, this cancer produces few, if any, symptoms in early stages,"" said Bang. ""This is why 75 percent of all women present with advanced disease which has already begun to spread to other areas of the body.""

The team treated 48 tumors, including those on the soft tissue, liver and lungs, in 21 women. In this study, cryoablation allowed nearly all women – 98 percent in the study —to eliminate their tumors without returning. In comparison, treating initial tumors with surgery and therapies such as chemo has only resulted in a 43 percent success rate, historically, Bang said.

Cryoablation of many tumors may be considered a treatment alternative, especially for those with anesthesia risks, painful lesions or those who want local control during chemotherapy, the researchers concluded.",Healthy Perspective: The latest health & wellness news with a dose of conversation,1,Cancer
story_reviews_00925,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Lightly shocking a person’s brain just before they learned a new task appeared to strengthen memory in a handful of patients with epilepsy, a tantalizing result that could have implications for Alzheimer’s disease, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.

Pacemaker devices known as deep brain stimulators made by Medtronic and St. Jude Medical are already used to calm muscle tremors in patients with Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders, and are being tested for a host of other conditions such as treatment-resistant depression.

The devices are implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading up the neck connected to tiny electrodes implanted deep in the brain, which produce electrical impulses.

The current study was done at the University of California at Los Angeles in seven epileptic patients awaiting surgery who had electrodes implanted deep in their brains to help pinpoint the source of their seizures. The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.

They focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.

“The entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain’s memory mainframe,” Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Fried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain’s chief memory center.

For the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.

“When we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,” Fried said.

Compared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.

IMPACT ON ALZHEIMER’S

In Alzheimer’s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.

Fried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.

“The question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,” he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.

Despite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer’s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.

Suzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was “very excited about the finding,” but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer’s patients.

The Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.

One team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer’s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.

Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.

“Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.",Tiny electrical shocks to the brain enhance memory: study,4,Alzheimer's

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 8, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Deep brain stimulation, a technique used to treat Parkinson's disease and certain psychiatric disorders, appears to provide some memory-enhancing benefits, researchers report.

Using electrical impulses to stimulate a part of the brain critical for memory function significantly improved patients' navigational ability, reflecting improved spatial memory, the small study from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) suggests.

Although the results are still preliminary, the method may potentially hold promise for boosting memory in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said.

""The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step,"" said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. ""I think it was exciting that they were really able to show that stimulating that area was important for a certain kind of learning. It raises more questions, and many more experiments that can be done.""

Seven patients awaiting possible surgery for the seizure disorder epilepsy had electrodes implanted in their brains to pinpoint the origin of their convulsions. The researchers followed them and found they were better able to recognize landmarks and to navigate routes more quickly in a video game featuring a taxi cab, virtual passengers and a cyber city. Patients played the role of cab drivers who picked up passengers and delivered them to one of six requested shops in the city.

Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said.

The study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

During the video game task, participants learned their way around a virtual town with and without five-second periods of deep brain stimulation, and were tested for their ability to reach predetermined landmarks. Six patients showed a 64 percent reduction in ""excess path length"" -- the ideal path between destinations, which indicated better performance -- for locations that had been learned during periods of deep brain stimulation.

For five patients, navigation to each of the three stores learned during stimulation was faster and shorter than navigation to the three stores learned without stimulation, indicating a consistent effect, the study said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.

""Critically, it was the stimulation at the gateway into the hippocampus, and not the hippocampus itself, that proved effective,"" senior study author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a university news release.

""Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia. At the same time, we studied a small sample of patients, so our results should be interpreted with caution,"" Fried added.

Currently, deep brain stimulation is used to control the tremors associated with Parkinson's, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some other psychiatric conditions, including depression.

Haber noted that the brain damage that occurs with epilepsy, which can produce memory problems, is different than that resulting from Alzheimer's disease, in which the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are believed to contribute to nerve cell deterioration. So it's difficult to generalize this study's results to other diseases that affect memory, she said, and the research didn't show if effects of temporary deep brain stimulation last beyond the study period.

""In these types of studies you think of things like this,"" Haber said, ""but how real it is, is something we're going to have to see. I think just trying to work out that there is some similarity in very simple learning [processes in the brain] is important.""

story_reviews_00927,"If all goes well for award-winning Plainfield inventor Matt Reavill, his new device will help save lives, decrease health care costs — and employ disabled veterans to boot.



Reavill won a prestigious contest in London late last year called the OmniCompete Health Pitch Battlefield, whose independent judges said his invention is a simple way to catheterize the heart. It reduces risks to an ""absolute minimum"" by moving the catheter insertion to the arm, the judges said, replacing a complex wire-guided procedure through the neck, which is typically used to monitor the heart during a hospital stay for very ill patients.



His breakthrough was also chosen by hospital-based clinical experts to participate in the 2010 Innovation Celebration, a national program run by Premier, a hospital-owned group purchasing organization. Premier Chief Operating Officer Mike Alkire says the products selected have the potential to improve safety and quality while cutting the cost of health care.



Reavill plans to hire 13 to 20 disabled vets to get the production off the ground — with the goal of hiring up to 18,000 if the device goes national. He recently procured a bank loan agreement and is hoping the award recognition and hospitals' willingness to try the catheter will attract a venture capitalist.



Called the ReavillMED CV, the Food and Drug Administration-cleared device includes a catheter called a PICC line, IV tubing that sheathes it to provide sterility, and a transducer that can directly measure blood pressure to help determine needed fluid levels. The catheter is inserted into the arm and travels to the heart within 20 to 30 seconds via the bloodstream. Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.



Reavill likes to say it's ""stupidly simple"" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.



""It's old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,"" Reavill says.



It remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it's self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.



In 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.



A venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a ""pseudo-operative field,"" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital's trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.



Dennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a ""tremendous amount of promise,"" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.



Dennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.



""Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,"" Dennis says. ""You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.""



Southern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill's catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer. The nurses have a success rate in the ""high 90s,"" Miller says, but ""very few"" hospitals have devoted the time or resources to create the discipline.



Reavill says he may be proudest of his intention to hire disabled veterans in southern Illinois, a hard-hit region economically. He plans to bear the cost of any prostheses the veterans need to work on the catheters.



Reavill grew up on a pig farm in Robinson, in southeastern Illinois, and attended Southern Illinois University, which is supporting the development of the device.

Adults don’t have much brown fat, but a new study suggests that hormones produced by the heart just might help them make more.

Researchers found that the hormones, known as cardiac natriuretic peptides, caused regular energy-storing white fat cells to turn into energy-burning brown fat in mice.

If studies show the same thing in humans, the heart hormone may hold the key to an effective weight loss treatment, says researcher Sheila Collins, PhD, of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in Orlando, Fla.

story_reviews_00929,"Feb. 1, 2012 -- A new drug appears to be effective for shrinking uterine fibroids and controlling the heavy menstrual bleeding they often cause, according to new research from Europe.

In one study, the drug ulipristal acetate proved to be much more effective than a placebo for shrinking the non-malignant uterine tumors.

In another, ulipristal acetate was found to be as effective as monthly injections of the drug Lupron for reducing heavy bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.

Both studies appear in the Feb. 2 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

story_reviews_00931,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first therapy to treat an underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a pill that targets a genetic mutation affecting a small minority of patients suffering from the life-threatening breathing disorder.

The drug, Kalydeco, from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., VRTX 0.14% will be among the most expensive therapies on the market, costing $294,000 a year.

Cystic fibrosis causes the body to produce an unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and obstructs the pancreas and stops enzymes from helping the body break down and absorb food. Patients are prone to infections and progressively lose the ability to breathe.

Until Tuesday's approval of Kalydeco, the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the U.S. and 100,000 world-wide could take medicines that only tackled the symptoms of the disease, such as antibiotics to treat the infections. Patients typically spent a few hours each day wearing vibrating vests to dislodge mucus build-up.

The medicine is a pill meant to be taken twice daily with fat-containing food. It was approved to treat patients who have a mutation in a gene that causes cystic fibrosis in about 4% of CF patients, some 1,200 people in the U.S.

The mutation, called G551D, is in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The CFTR gene regulates the transport of chloride and water in the body. Kalydeco helps the protein made by the CFTR gene function better, which improves lung function and improves other side effects of cystic fibrosis.

""Now I'm nervous about growing old,"" said Emily Schaller, a 29-year-old from Trenton, Mich., who has been taking the pills as part of clinical trials since late 2009 and has since run five half-marathons. ""I've never been more hopeful.""

Kalydeco comes with one of the most expensive price tags for a medicine, according to Lawrence Marsh, a Barclays Capital analyst. He said more expensive drugs include Soliris, which treats a blood disorder and costs $409,500 a year, and Elaprase, which treats a potentially fatal condition that causes mental retardation and costs $375,000 a year.

Like Kalydeco, these drugs tend to provide significant improvements for a small number of patients. For that reason, health plans tend to cover the cost.

Jeff Leiden, who becomes Vertex's chief executive on Wednesday, said the pricing reflects the value the drug provides, the small number of patients indicated for it, and the company's hefty investment in developing cystic fibrosis treatments.

It is ""hard to make these drugs. It takes hundreds of people working over a number of years and hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's all at risk"" of not succeeding, Dr. Leiden said in an interview.

Vertex plans to provide some financial assistance to patients. After $15 a month, for instance, it will pay up to 30% of the drug's cost—as much as $88,000 a year—for eligible patients who are commercially insured but facing high co-pays or co-insurance costs, a spokesman said. The company will also assign a case manager to each patient to help guide them through financial issues.

Kalydeco was approved for use in patients six-years-old and older. It was approved in about three months and ahead of an April deadline, according to FDA and the company. The company is planning a study of the drug in patients between two years and five years old.

They found daily supplements of soy germ isoflavones reduced the sudden sweats more than inactive placebo pills after six months.

But a U.S. expert wasn’t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies.

“The majority of them are showing no benefit,” said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn’t involved in the new work.

The new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. A third of them received placebo pills made of starch, while the rest took soy germ isoflavones, either 84 or 126 milligrams a day.

They all kept diaries of their hot flashes and filled out questionnaires about various problems tied to menopause, including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, tiredness and headache.

At six months, their Kupperman scores — a measure of symptom severity that ranges from 0 to 63 — had dropped by more than 40 percent from an initial value of about 25 in the soy groups.

The number of hot flashes also fell from about 20 a week to less than 10.

While the same pattern was seen in the placebo group, it was less pronounced. Their symptom score dropped by 29 percent and the number of hot flashes by 35 percent, according to Dr. Yan-bin Ye of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.

The work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements.

Wong cautioned that the new study was small and that the women involved only had few hot flashes. He said it was “hard to believe” that soy would have an effect on these women.

In one of his own studies, Wong found no effect on soy germ isoflavones among women who took the supplements for two years.

The standard drug treatment for stubborn menopause symptoms is hormone replacement therapy. But doctors and women have become increasingly wary of that option because of serious side effects such as increased risk for heart attack, stroke and breast cancer.

“It is something they need to gauge, is it worth the risk?” Wong told Reuters Health.

He generally recommends exercise and an active lifestyle to women who feel bothered by menopause.

Soy supplements also have side effects such as nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the National Institutes of Health. A month’s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.

Wong said that in Asia, women tend to think of menopause problems as a natural part of life — not a medical problem.

“There is a major cultural difference in how we deal with menopause symptoms,” he mused.

The new study didn’t find significant hormone changes in women who took soy supplements, and Wong said the compounds are probably safe for women.

“Consuming soy is not bad for them,” Wong noted, “but it might be a waste of money if you don’t see any benefit.”

story_reviews_00933,"When Kathryn DiPasqua, 51, started having bothersome menopausal hot flashes, she had a chat with her gynecologist: ""I told her 'I do not want to go on hormone replacement therapy. I'm a healthy person. I don't want to put anything unnecessary inside my body.' ""

So DiPasqua, like many women, tried other things, for four years: ""I tried black cohosh, I tried soybeans; I would eat edamame by the handful,"" says the Richmond, Va., college marketing specialist. She limited caffeine and alcohol and jogged daily.

The result: She kept on overheating, about a dozen times a day and two or three times a night. She says her makeup melted, her clothes were ruined, her sheets soaked — and she got just plain tired.

A few months ago, she went back to her doctor and got a prescription for a hormone patch. She doesn't love it, she says, but it works.

What doesn't work for hot flashes: Among remedies that have failed repeated scientific tests:



Soy products: Soy contains a plant estrogen. And Japanese women, who eat a lot of it, have fewer hot flashes. But the most recent disappointing study, published in August in the Archives of Internal Medicine, found that women who took soy supplements actually had more hot flashes than those who did not.



Flaxseed:: Researchers at the Mayo Clinic created some excitement in 2007 when they reported that flaxseed, which also contains plant estrogen, helped reduce hot flashes in a small study. A few months ago, they reported on a larger follow-up study. Bottom line: it didn’t work and caused bloating, diarrhea and nausea.



Black cohosh and red clover: These herbs worked no better than placebos in a year-long study published in Menopause in 2009.





DiPasqua's experiences are right in line with the latest research: Despite high hopes and years of study, most alternative treatments for hot flashes just don't work. Hormones do, but many women still see them as a last resort. A few other prescription drugs show mild promise.

Hot flash FAQ: What are they? Sudden sensations of heat, often accompanied by sweating and skin reddening and sometimes palpitations.



What triggers them? Falling estrogen levels set the stage. But day to day triggers can include sudden changes in room temperature, hot drinks, stress, alcohol and caffeine.



Who has them? More than half of U.S. women in the menopausal transition (usually mid-40s to mid-50s). Obese women and smokers are at increased risk.



How long does one hot flash last? 30 seconds to 1 hour. Average time: 3 to 4 minutes.



For how many years can a woman have hot flashes? In some cases, 20 years or more. Half have flashes for at least four years.



How bothersome are they? For 20% to 25% of women, the physical discomfort and embarrassment have a significant, negative impact on quality of life.

So the great, universally accepted hot flash cure remains elusive.

Searching for alternatives

""It's not a very optimistic picture,"" says Robert Freedman, a professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University, Detroit. He contributed to a treatment review published recently in the journal Climacteric by the International Menopause Society.

The report is bluntly dismissive of non-prescription remedies, saying: ""Substantial funding from the National Institutes of Health and other non-pharmaceutical sources has failed to show any benefit of over-the-counter therapies compared to placebo for (hot flashes), and the safety of these compounds is not confirmed.""

The comparison to placebos is key, because even sham treatments reduce reported hot flashes, at least temporarily, by about 50%, says Michelle Warren, medical director of the women's health center at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York. So it's no wonder many women believe over-the-counter potions are effective, she says. ""But when they are tested rigorously against placebos, they don't work.""

Studies continue. For example, some researchers are looking at equol, derived from soy, which might help some women, says Margery Gass, executive director of the North American Menopause Society and a consultant at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Specialized Women's Health.

""It's always good to have research on other options,"" she says.

Meanwhile, doctors still recommend exercise — it improves mood and has many other health benefits — but studies have failed to show it relieves hot flashes. In fact, aerobic exercise can trigger them, Freedman says. Yoga might be better. ""Paced respiration,"" the slow, measured abdominal breathing used in yoga, clearly helps some women, Freedman says.

And it never hurts to keep your house cool, your clothes layered and a fan handy.

Estrogen often is a last resort

But when those things don't work, and when women are miserable (not everyone is), most doctors will offer a prescription.

It could be for one of several non-hormonal drugs, including some antidepressants, which modestly reduce hot flashes. But the first choice — except for women with a history of breast cancer or other health conflicts — is still hormone therapy (estrogen, often combined with progestin).

It reduces hot flashes by about 90% and ""it's actually very safe, but that's not getting across to the public,"" Warren says.

Studies since 2002, when a big study linked the hormones with breast cancer, have ""given us a lot of reassurance"" that risks are low for women who use them for a short time around menopause, Gass says.

Hormones still are not for every woman, but for DiPasqua, the benefits are clear. She's already stepped down from a dose that stopped all of her hot flashes but made her feel bloated. She feels better on a lower dose and is happy ""just simmering, instead of boiling over all the time,"" she says.

The best part, she says, is that she's not thinking about hot flashes much at all. Instead, she says, she's thinking about her next life passage — becoming a grandmother sometime in the next few days.",Hot flash remedies: Estrogen may be the best answer,5,Reuters Health

TUESDAY, Jan. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Combining two drugs that target an aggressive type of breast cancer known as HER2-positive appears to work better than using either drug alone, researchers report.

The dual-drug approach greatly boosted the chances of eliminating microscopic signs of early cancer by the time a woman was due to have surgery, said researcher Dr. Jose Baselga, chief of hematology/oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

The study was published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet.

The two drugs are Tykerb (lapatinib) and Herceptin (trastuzumab). Using both together resulted in a 51 percent response, compared with a 30 percent response in women given Herceptin alone. Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response.

""What we observed was a massive improvement in response,"" Baselga said.

GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study.

""Lapatinib was approved for advanced breast cancer in 2007,"" Baselga said. ""The question we had was, what is the efficacy if we give it in early-stage breast cancer prior to surgery?""

Baselga and his colleagues conducted a trial treating 455 women from 23 countries. All had HER2-positive breast cancers. All had tumors larger than about three-fourths of an inch.

In HER2-positive breast cancer, test results are positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which promotes cancer cell growth.

In the study, 154 women got Tykerb, 149 Herceptin and the other 152 both drugs. All had the drug regimen before surgery, with Taxol (paclitaxel), a standard chemotherapy, added after six weeks. After 12 more weeks of treatment, the women had surgery.

At that point, researchers evaluated who had better responses. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival.

Baselga stressed that the study looked only at women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers, and that the drug Tykerb is approved now only for advanced breast cancers.

The study is well done and important, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. The two drugs, he said, ""affect the same pathway but do it in a different way.""

While the combination showed a better response rate, ""there is also an increased level of side effects,"" he noted.

While no major heart problems occurred, those on Tykerb alone or the two-drug combination had more diarrhea. Liver-enzyme alterations were also more frequent when Tykerb was used.

GlaxoSmithKline notes that liver toxicity with the drug may be severe and that deaths have been reported, although the cause of the deaths has not been determined.

The important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.

Cost is another consideration: Tykerb runs about $4,000 a month wholesale, and retail prices could be higher.

In another study, published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet Oncology, researchers from Germany reported that Tykerb is less beneficial than Herceptin as a single-drug therapy.

They assigned 620 women with HER2-positive breast cancer to get standard chemotherapy plus Herceptin or Tykerb.

They looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes. While 30 percent of those in the Herceptin group had this response, 23 percent of the Tykerb group did. The study was funded by drug makers GlaxoSmithKline, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis.

Baselga reports receiving honoraria from Roche; other co-authors report receiving speaking fees or honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline and fees from other drug companies.

story_reviews_00935,"Since her teens, Lesa Merlo, of Hinsdale, had learned to compensate as her hearing declined. She used the television's closed-captioning feature. She read lips and paid attention to body language. Often, it meant only being able to do one thing at a time, explained the mother of three young children.



Now, thanks to an implant called Esteem, Merlo can multitask. ""I can make dinner and supervise homework at the same time,"" she said. ""I don't have to stop and look directly at the children. I can hear what they're saying behind my back.""



Unlike a hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, Esteem is a prosthetic inner-ear stimulator. ""When I wore a hearing aid, I turned it off when I got home because all the background noise was so agitating,"" said Merlo, 40. ""But I keep (the Esteem) on."" A controller the size of a cellphone enables her to set her Esteem to different environments, such as ""home,"" ""restaurant"" or ""school.""



Merlo's doctor, ear surgeon Sam Marzo of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, has performed 40 Esteem implants since he was trained by its manufacturer, Envoy Medical Corp. in St. Paul, Minn., in 2010. He is the only Chicago-area surgeon authorized to implant the device, said an Envoy representative. Esteem was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 2010. (For surgeons outside Chicago, visit envoymedical.com.)



""This really fills a need for adults with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss,"" Marzo said. The condition is caused by damage to the inner ear or to nerves from the inner ear to the brain. For patients with profound hearing loss, a cochlear implant is a better option, he said.



""Esteem is great for people who have used hearing aids but are not happy with them,"" Marzo said. ""Aids require a lot of upkeep and need frequent battery changes. And they amplify all the noise so it's hard to filter out background noise.""



Implanting the Esteem is a three-hour outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia. About two months post-surgery, when internal swelling has subsided, the doctor turns on the device.



""It is surgery, so there is pain at first,"" Merlo said. ""But within a few days I was comfortable. I had an incision behind my ear, but my hair covers it. Cosmetically, you can't see anything now.""



The implant is permanent. It contains a battery that must be replaced in about seven years.



Merlo had Esteem implanted in her left ear in September. In March, she plans to have one put in her right ear.



Even with one implant, Merlo called the results ""surreal."" ""There are little things that I probably heard when I was younger, before my hearing loss, but I don't remember them,"" she said. ""Since I got the implant, they're new to me. Branches tapping the windows, the breathing of the horses when I ride, different instruments in my favorite songs. I always loved music but now I can really hear it.""



The implant also allows Merlo to hear herself talking. ""That helps my speech,"" she said. ""Now I know if I blur my THs.""



Merlo said her children no longer have to be her extra ears, telling her when the oven timer beeps or when the doorbell rings. ""Now they tell me, 'You never say 'What?' anymore,"" she said.



""My husband and I joke that the best wife is the one who doesn't hear,"" Merlo said. ""But not hearing affects everything. People used to think I was standoffish in social situations because I was quiet. I nodded a lot because I couldn't hear them. Now I can.""",New implant addresses hearing loss caused by inner-ear damage,3,Cancer
story_reviews_00936,"(Reuters) - People who eat lots of magnesium-rich foods such as leafy green vegetables, nuts and beans have fewer strokes, according to an international analysis covering some 250,000 people.

But the authors of the study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, stopped short of recommending people take a daily magnesium supplement because their analysis focused on magnesium in food — and it may be another aspect of the food that is responsible for their finding.

“Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,” wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.

The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with “magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,” she added.

Larsson and her colleagues combed through research databases spanning the last 45 years to find studies that tracked how much magnesium people took and how many of them had a stroke over time.

In seven studies published in the past 14 years, about 250,000 people in the United States, Europe and Asia were followed for an average of 11.5 years. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed.

For every extra 100 milligrams of magnesium a person ate per day, their risk of an ischemic stroke — the most common kind, typically caused by a blood clot — fell by nine percent.

The median magnesium intake for U.S. citizens included in the analysis was 242 milligrams a day. The United States recommends that men and women over age 31 eat 420 and 320 milligrams of magnesium daily, respectively.

Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history.

But Larsson told Reuters Health in an email that she could not say whether other aspects of what the people ate partially or entirely explained the finding.

More in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.

Other experts said the results were consistent with dietary recommendations.

“It’s a diet that’s rich in fruits, vegetables and grains. Those are things that have low sodium, high potassium and high magnesium,” said Larry Goldstein, director of the stroke center at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 11, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new type of stem cell treatment for people with type 1 diabetes appears to help re-educate rogue immune system cells, which allows cells in the pancreas to start producing insulin again.

The treatment, which combines a patient's immune system cells with stem cells from a donor's cord blood, even worked in people with long-standing diabetes who were believed to have no insulin-producing ability.

Although the treatment didn't wean anyone off insulin completely, average blood sugar levels dropped significantly, which would reduce the risk of long-term complications.

""Our study brings a new hope for people with type 1 diabetes. If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,"" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

This treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

""It's quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,"" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.

But he's also ""reasonably cautious,"" he said. ""The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,"" said Inverardi.

Also, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.

Results of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.

Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.

Stopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.

Zhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this ""Stem Cell Educator Therapy,"" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.

The study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.

The researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.

The average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.

""That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,"" Inverardi said.

The average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.

This was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.

But, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. ""In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,"" Inverardi noted.

Both experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.

While smoking is a public health scourge, the nicotine in cigarettes may have some promise in treating another growing problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which can be a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. A new study on nonsmokers found that six months of treatment with nicotine patches restored long-term memory performance to 46% of normal— while placebo patients experienced a 26% decline in recall during the same treatment period.

The randomized controlled trial included 74 people, mainly in their late 70’s, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI falls somewhere between the normal senior moments that occur with aging, and the more serious lapses in recall and orientation that are typical of dementia. People with MCI are aware of their deficits, but are still able to function and complete their daily activities. Prior research has shown repeatedly that nicotine enhances memory and reaction time, which is one reason smokers cite for sticking with their habit. About half the participants were former smokers.

Attention, memory and reaction time all improved in those given nicotine treatment on several objective tests— and patients’ own ratings of their cognitive abilities and those of family members or other people close to them also showed improvement. Moreover, nicotine’s positive effects did not seem to wane over time. However, when clinical experts rated overall general change in the patients, they did not see a significant difference between the two groups.

MORE: A Cheaper Way to Quit Smoking?

Was the nicotine actually having an effect on memory? Possibly. Intriguingly, it appeared to be more effective among people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, a genetic combination that increases risk for Alzheimer’s by a factor of 20 or higher. People with Alzheimer’s disease have reduced numbers of nicotine receptors in their brains— and while the research is conflicting, some evidence suggests that the drug could protect these neurons. Other research, however, suggests that nicotine might enhance the cancer-causing properties of other substances.

The authors conclude, “This initial study provides evidence for nicotine-induced cognitive improvement in subjects with MCI; however, whether these effects are clinically important will require larger studies.”

The study found no problematic side effects associated with the nicotine patch and none of the patients had withdrawal symptoms when it was stopped. However, patients on nicotine did lose a few pounds, which is a known side effect.

The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging, but some of the authors also receive pharmaceutical industry funding and one reported funding from Philip Morris. Patches were provided by the manufacturer, Pfizer.

The study was led by Dr. Paul Newhouse of Vanderbilt University and published in Neurology.

story_reviews_00940,"Jan. 9, 2012 -- Nicotine replacement therapies such as gums or patches may not help smokers kick the habit long-term, a new study shows.

Relapse rates of the quitters were similar during the study period, whether they used the products alone or with counseling, or they did not use them.

""Nicotine replacement therapies ... do not show any long-term effect on quitting even when combined with counseling,"" says researcher Gregory Connolly, DMD, director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control and professor of public health at the Harvard School of Public Health. Behavioral counseling is widely recommended, with medication, to help smokers quit.

Smoking cessation experts and a maker of nicotine replacement therapies took issue with the findings.

Connolly does not advocate abandoning the nicotine replacement medication. Instead, he suggests understanding its use. ""In the short term, what it is designed for is treatment of withdrawal,"" he says. ""Long term, our study would not say it would prevent relapse."" Better strategies are needed to prevent relapse, he tells WebMD.",Nicotine Replacement Treatments May Not Work Long-Term,4,TIME

Doctors who treat smokers said that the study findings were not unexpected, given the haphazard way many smokers used the products. “Patient compliance is a very big issue,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic , who was not involved in the study.

Dr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches “are absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,” unlike smokers who are self-treating.

The products have been controversial since at least 2002, when researchers at the University of California, San Diego , reported from a large survey that they appeared to offer no benefit. The study did not follow people over time. A government-appointed panel that included nicotine replacement as part of federal guidelines for treatment also came under fire, because panel members had gotten payments from the product manufacturers.

“Some studies have questioned these treatments, but the bulk of clinical trials have unequivocally endorsed them,” said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the University of Wisconsin ’s Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention and the chairman of the panel that wrote the guidelines. Dr. Fiore, who has reported receiving payments from drug makers, said that “there are millions of smokers out there desperate to quit, and it would be a tragedy if they felt, because of one study, that this option is ineffective.”

In the new study, conducted in Massachusetts , the researchers followed a representative sample of 1,916 adults, including 787 people who said at the start of the study that they had recently quit smoking. They interviewed the participants three times, about once every two years during the 2000s, asking the smokers and quitters about their use of gum, patches and other such products, their periods of not smoking and their relapses.

At each stage, about one-third of the people trying to quit had relapsed, the study found. The use of replacement products made no difference, whether they were taken for the recommended two-month period (they usually were not), or with the guidance of a cessation counselor.

One subgroup, heavy smokers (defined as those who had their first cigarette within a half-hour of waking up) who used replacement products without counseling, was twice as likely to relapse as heavy smokers who did not use them.

“Our study essentially shows that what happens in the real world is very different” from what happens in clinical trials, said Hillel R. Alpert of Harvard, a co-author with Dr. Connolly and Lois Biener of the University of Massachusetts , Boston .

story_reviews_00942,"Smokers who count on nicotine patches or gum to help them quit may want to reconsider: A new study finds that these and other nicotine replacement products aren’t effective at preventing former smokers from relapsing in real-world conditions.

Among 787 adults who had quit smoking within the previous two years, nearly a third reported having returned to using cigarettes, according to a study published online Monday by the journal Tobacco Control. Those who had used nicotine patches, gum, inhalers or nasal sprays were just as likely to relapse as those who had quit without them, researchers from Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts found.

The findings run counter to the results of several randomized clinical trials conducted before the Food and Drug Administration gave the thumbs-up to these nicotine replacement products in the 1990s. In those trials, volunteers using such products were up to three times more likely to kick the smoking habit.

But the latest results are in line with other studies that have found little — if any — benefit from the products when used by smokers in real life. In some cases, studies have found that people who use products like nicotine patches and gums are more likely to relapse than their counterparts who go cold turkey.

“This may indicate that some heavily dependent smokers perceive NRT [nicotine replacement therapy] as a sort of ‘magic’ pill, and, upon realizing it is not, they find themselves without support in their quitting efforts, doomed to failure,” the researchers wrote.

The new study examined former smokers three times over a five-year period. At the midpoint of the study, 30.6% of recent quitters had gone back to smoking. By the end, 31.3% had relapsed.

American smokers spend more than $1.5 billion on nicotine gum, patches and related products each year, according to the study. Much of that comes from public health programs, which are facing further rounds of budget cuts. Policymakers ought to rethink their willingness to pay for nicotine replacement therapy, the researchers wrote, and consider shifting that money to initiatives aimed at discouraging smoking in general, such as anti-smoking campaigns and efforts to raise tobacco taxes.

But GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which makes Nicorette, Nicoderm, Commit lozenges and other smoking cessation products, said that would be premature. The company noted that most of the adults in the study who used nicotine replacement products didn’t use them for the recommended eight weeks. Had those people followed directions, they might have had more success.

“Hundreds of clinical trials involving more than 35,000 participants and extensive consumer use for more than 20 years have proven both the efficacy and safety of NRT when used as directed,” the company said in a statement. “NRT products have helped millions of smokers quit by gradually weaning them off of their tobacco addiction and is recommended as a first-line therapy for quitting.”

The morning coffee drinkers at Dunkin’ Donuts notwithstanding, caffeine has a strong reputation as a weight-loss aid. The stimulant is one of the key ingredients of Zantrex-3, the popular weight-loss supplement from Zoller Laboratories, based in Salt Lake City. The company claims each capsule contains “up to” 160 milligrams of “caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants” (from green tea and yerba mate, among other sources), while a government database of supplements says each capsule of Zantrex-3 contains more than 160 mg of caffeine. That’s slightly more than you’d get from a typical double shot of espresso. Other ingredients include ginseng and damiana, a Latin American herb traditionally used as an aphrodisiac.

Users are instructed to take two capsules with a glass of water before a meal or anytime during the day when they need an energy boost. According to the label, they shouldn’t take more than six capsules in a day. Zantrex-3 is available at many drugstores. You can expect to pay about $20 for a package of 30 capsules.

LipoFuze, a weight-loss supplement from E Nutrition Research, based in Orem, Utah, also packs a significant amount of caffeine. The label says that each capsule contains 200 mg of a green tea extract that is 50% caffeine. Other ingredients include vitamin D, chromium and coenzyme Q10.

Users are instructed to take two capsules a day. A package of 60, a one-month’s supply, costs about $50.

The claims

The website for Zantrex-3 says it provides both extreme energy and rapid weight loss — “546% more weight loss than the leading ephedra-based diet pill,” to be exact. The site features a picture of reality TV star (and official product endorser) Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of “Jersey Shore” pulling a bottle of the pills out of her purse. (The website calls her a “celebrity,” and, yes, the term is in quotation marks.)

Amy Heaton, director of scientific affairs for Zoller, says that caffeine and caffeine-like compounds have been proved to improve energy, stamina, concentration, mood and metabolism. But, she says, “they have not been shown to significantly increase weight loss.”

Heaton adds that “it’s not just about weight loss. It’s about fat loss and increased energy.” To drive home the message, she points to Snooki’s transformation “from a self-professed meatball to a sexy and slim fireball.”

The website for LipoFuze says that the supplement “increases the metabolic mechanism in your body.” The site also says the green tea and caffeine will “rev up your metabolism” and “increase energy, focus and physical performance.” The site features testimonials it says are from users who claim they have lost huge amounts of weight with the help of LipoFuze. One man says he dropped more than 100 pounds, although it’s unclear how long that took. A woman says she lost 40 pounds in less than a year, including 20 pounds in her first month.

Attempts to reach E Nutrition Research for comment were not successful.

The bottom line

Caffeine shows up in a lot of weight-loss products, but it doesn’t seem to be any sort of silver bullet against flab, says C. Michael White, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. White says that, to his knowledge, there are no well-designed studies showing that caffeine works better than a placebo when it comes to weight loss.

White notes that caffeine is a diuretic, which means that people taking large doses might shed some weight through water loss, but that’s not the kind of slimming most users are looking for.

As reported in a 2010 issue of the International Journal of Obesity, caffeine may in fact be able to increase a person’s metabolic rate by 4% or 5%. But, according to White, there’s no clear evidence that this translates into actual weight loss. One possible explanation: Any increase in metabolism might go hand-in-hand with a boost in appetite, he says.

Caffeine does seem to enhance the weight-loss powers of some other ingredients, White says. For example, green tea contains antioxidants that encourage cells to burn extra calories, and caffeinated green tea seems to promote more weight loss than decaf versions. But even this combination yields very modest results. “In clinical trials, the weight loss is 2.5 to 4 pounds, not 40 pounds,” White says.

Gerald Endress, the fitness director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C., says patients often ask about caffeine as a weight-loss aid. “I tell them it’s definitely not going to be as helpful as 30 minutes of exercise.”

Endress says a little caffeine before a workout might help a person exercise harder and longer, which could theoretically help them control their weight. But the real credit would go to the exercise, not the caffeine.

Endress also warns that too much caffeine — such as the high doses found in Zantrex — could cause jitteriness, anxiety, spikes in blood pressure and rapid heartbeats in some people.

story_reviews_00944,"In a study suggesting that red wine might be the next big thing in breast cancer prevention, a study has found that women who drank just under two servings of red wine daily experienced hormonal changes that mimic the effects of a drug used to prevent malignant breast tumors from coming back.

The study, published Friday in the Journal of Women’s Health, found that consuming the same amount of white wine did not have the same effect in premenopausal women participating in the study.

Women intent on warding off breast cancer have been warned about alcohol consumption: as recently as November, a study found that women who consumed as few as three servings of alcohol a week increased their risk of developing the disease, which strikes one in eight American women at some point in life.

White wine and other alcoholic beverages are believed to promote the conversion of androgens--""male hormones” such as testosterone, which circulate in all women’s blood--into estrogen. And the greater a woman’s lifetime exposure to estrogen--whether her own or estrogen that comes from medication or environmental sources--the higher her risk of developing breast cancer.

But red wine acts differently, the present study found. Instead of promoting the conversion of androgens to estrogen in a woman’s body, red wine appears to block that process. In that sense, it acts more like a class of drug called aromatase inhibitors, which are prescribed to most women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer to prevent recurrences.

It’s not the alcohol in red wine that appears to conjure such magic. It’s the phytochemicals, which also are found in grapes, grape juice and grape seed extract. Resveratrol, one of the phytochemicals found plentifully in red wine, has been linked to a host of disease-preventing processes.

Researchers led by a team from Cedars-Sinai’s Heart Institute and Medical Center found that study participants who drank eight ounces of red wine daily (the equivalent of almost two servings at five ounces per serving) showed a significantly different mix of seven sex hormones than those who drank the same amount of white wine. Among the red wine drinkers, estrogen levels were lower and androgen levels were higher.

The current study was small--36 women, with an average age of 36, participated. Each drank eight ounces nightly of Cabernet Sauvignon wine for most of a single menstrual cycle, then drank no alcohol for a little over a week and then drank eight ounces of Chardonnay nightly for roughly the next 21 days.

The authors asserted this was the first rigorous study to find that red wine is a “nutritional aromatase inhibitor in healthy premenopausal women.” Another study has found that women who drank more red wine showed less breast density on mammograms--an emerging marker for breast cancer risk-- than those who drank other forms of alcohol.

THURSDAY, Jan. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary findings suggest a drug used to treat another disease might also reduce painful flare-ups in gout patients starting new medication regimens.

In a new study, the protein-inhibitor drug rilonacept (Arcalyst) appeared to markedly lower the risk of gout flare-ups during the first few months of treatments aimed at lowering uric acid levels.

While effective in lowering the risk for gout attacks in the long-term, uric acid-lowering treatment can initially boost the risk for flare-ups as it breaks up and releases the uric acid crystal deposits at the source.

""To reduce deposits of crystals in the joints, we advise patients to initiate treatment with medications that lower levels of uric acid in the blood,"" study author Dr. H. Ralph Schumacher, Jr., a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said in a journal news release.

Gout, a debilitating and painful form of inflammatory arthritis, now affects upwards of 8.3 million Americans, according to the release. Flare-ups , which involve excruciating joint pain, redness, swelling and warmth, can last days or weeks.

The researchers wanted to learn if rilonacept could lower this short-term risk for by neutralizing a specific target protein -- interleukin 1 or IL-1 -- before it initiates inflammation.

They looked at 83 gout patients in 27 U.S. study centers who had a history of gout flare-ups and high levels of uric acid. All were placed on a chronic uric-acid lowering regimen of the standard drug allopurinol.

About half were also given an initial double-dose injection of rilonacept (320 milligrams) followed by a single dose for 16 weeks. The other half received sugar pills.

Rilonacept patients were less likely to have flare-ups, with 15 percent experiencing flare-ups three-months into the study compared with 45 percent among the non-rilonacept group, the researchers found.

""Well-tolerated drugs that reduce the risk of gout flares when initiating uric-acid lowering therapy could make patients more likely to continue important long-term treatments that control gout,"" Schumacher said in the release.

""(And) this trial provides well-controlled evidence that this IL-1 blocker is effective in preventing acute gout flares in this setting,"" he added. ""Rilonacept appears safe and well tolerated and could increase patient adherence to long-term urate-lowering therapy.""

The study appeared online Jan. 5 in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism.

Dr. Michael A. Becker, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Chicago, described the findings as ""very promising."" However, he cautioned that the high cost of rilonacept will most likely curtail its use.

""This is a very expensive drug,"" he said. ""And insurance will be an issue. So I think you will have to carefully justify its use and define the universe of patients who are likely to be treated with it.""

""But there are a number of patients who can't take a less expensive alternative, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, because of their kidney function or ulcer disease,"" Becker noted. ""So for this population of patients who can't tolerate cheaper medications, rilonacept may be a necessary indication.""

story_reviews_00946,"Could a vitamin make antidepressants work better?

That's the tantalizing premise behind Deplin, a prescription form of the B-vitamin folate. Although it has been on the market since 2006, Deplin is generating growing buzz at psychiatric conferences and among clinicians and patients, particularly those who haven't responded to antidepressants or did for a while only to have their depression return.

""Many of the patients I put on Deplin come back and say, 'Wow, my medication is working again' or 'Hey, doc, this medicine never worked this well before,' "" says psychiatrist Thor Bergersen, who practices in Needham, Mass., and New York City.

It's long been known that folate—found naturally in green, leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and some fruits—is important for cell growth and brain function. How and why is now becoming clearer. Recent research has found that the body converts folate (and folic acid, the synthetic version) into an active form called L-methylfolate, which is needed to produce serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, three neurotransmitters that are critical in regulating mood.

Trial and Error For many patients, treating depression involves trying multiple drugs over a long period of time. • Nearly 20 million people in the U.S. suffer depression during their lifetime. •11% of Americans over age 12 take antidepressants. • Only 30% get well on the first antidepressant alone. • Up to 50% of patients never reach remission. • People with low folate levels are six times as likely to fail to respond to antidepressants as those with normal levels. Sources: CDC; NIMH; Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology

Aging, illness, genetics, poor nutrition, excess alcohol consumption and some medications can all reduce L-methylfolate levels, leaving those neurotransmitters in short supply, some researchers say. While many popular antidepressants slow the ""reuptake"" of serotonin or norepinephrine, making them available longer to the brain, such drugs may not work for long or at all if the brain isn't producing sufficient quantities of the neurotransmitters in the first place, some experts theorize.

""This is a totally new way to look at depression. We may be getting at the very foundation of why many people never achieve a full remission,"" says John Zajecka, director of the Depression Treatment & Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Dr. Zajecka has helped investigate Deplin and is on the speakers bureau for its maker, Pamlab LLC, of Covington, La.

Pamlab officials say that Deplin, which contains L-methylfolate, can directly supply what some people need to make sufficient quantities of neurotransmitters that regulate mood. And it does so more efficiently than taking extra folic acid, which still needs to be converted, they say.

As convincing as that sounds, clinical evidence is limited. Pamlab, which currently has the market to itself, sells Deplin as a ""medical food,"" a category that isn't held to the same standards the Food and Drug Administration demands of new drugs. Medical foods are intended to provide dietary management for a disease or condition; all ingredients must be ""generally recognized as safe"" and physician supervision is required.

Nearly 30,000 clinicians have prescribed Deplin in the past three years, according to Pamlab, and monthly prescriptions grew 31% to nearly 39,000 in October from January 2011. Still, that's a tiny fraction of the more than 20 million prescriptions for antidepressants every month in the U.S.

Just two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated Deplin, with a total of 223 subjects. Both were supported by Pamlab. In one study, presented at the American Psychiatric Association's meeting in May, 75 depressed patients were randomly assigned to take either 15 milligrams of Deplin or a placebo along with an antidepressant. After 30 days, 32% of subjects on Deplin had responded, compared with 15% on the placebo. However, an earlier study using a lower dose of Deplin found no difference with a placebo. Subjects reported no more side effects with Deplin than with the placebo in either trial.

About Folate • Folate, a B vitamin found naturally in some foods, is needed to maintain cell growth and brain function. Deficiencies are associated with depression, certain types of anemia and birth defects. Poor diet, aging, illness, alcoholism and some medications can lower folate levels. • Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, found in supplements and used to fortify grains. • L-methylfolate, the active form of folate, helps produce the neurotransmitters critical to regulating mood. About 50% of Americans have genetic variations that reduce their ability to create L-methylfolate, which may raise their risk of depression. Sources: CNS Spectrum; WSJ reporting

The biggest gripe with Deplin is the cost: One month's supply of Deplin, either at 7.5 milligrams or 15 milligrams, can cost as much as $98 and not all insurers cover it. Pamlab has a licensed generic version called simply L-Methylfolate that went on the market in August and is priced somewhat lower. More insurers are covering that version, some with copayments as low as $20, says Pamlab, which also makes medical foods for managing other conditions, including asthma.

Pamlab officials say they hope eventually to win FDA approval for Deplin as a prescription drug. The company says it plans to start Phase II trials later this year; one branch of the trials will assess whether Deplin could effectively treat depression on its own.

Researchers also hope to determine which patients would benefit most from Deplin, to cut down on the frustrating trial-and-error process many people face in finding an effective antidepressant. One target could be people who have a genetic variation that reduces their ability to make L-methylfolate. Roughly 30% of the U.S. population has one abnormal copy of the gene known as MTHFR 677, and 12% has two abnormal copies, giving them less than one-third of the typical amount of L-methylfolate, researchers say.

But some people who had two normal copies of the MTHFR gene also responded well to Deplin, ""so there are clearly other factors involved as well,"" says Harold Koch, Pamlab's chief scientific officer.

Despite the uncertainties, some clinicians say they are comfortable prescribing Deplin. ""I have had people write me thank-you notes because it's given them a boost of energy and happiness,"" says Judy Paley, an internist in Denver, Colo.

""My patients who have responded are not people who are suggestible. They've been trying different medications for years,"" says Andres San Martin, a Manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in treating resistant depression.

Other experts are more cautious. ""It doesn't appear to have a lot of downsides, but sometimes it takes a few years of use to recognize them,"" says Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an education and advocacy group. Dr. Duckworth also urges patients with resistant depression to try cognitive-behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise and substance-abuse programs, all of which have clear evidence of effectiveness. ""And remember there is no silver bullet,"" he says.

story_reviews_00947,"WASHINGTON – Check-ups during pregnancy tend to focus around the waist. But there's growing debate about which mothers-to-be should have a gland in their neck tested, too.

Numerous studies since 1999 have found that an underactive thyroid can raise a woman's risk of miscarriage, premature birth, or a lower IQ for her baby — even if it's so mildly sluggish that she feels no symptoms.

The problem: While serious cases are treated with a hormone pill, so far there's little evidence that treating the milder cases makes a difference. So guidelines about who should be tested vary widely.

Now a peek at prenatal testing from one of the country's largest medical labs suggests that nearly a quarter of pregnant women are getting the simple thyroid blood test regardless of whether they have symptoms.

Researchers at Quest Diagnostics examined records for half a million pregnant women. Of those who got tested, a higher-than-expected number — 15 percent — had an underactive thyroid. That's five-fold higher than some previous estimates, partly because the way in which the condition is diagnosed has changed recently, says the study published by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

The vast majority of those women were in the gray zone, with milder cases where no one knows for sure if a diagnosis helps or wastes money on testing and thyroid medication.

The finding adds pressure for science to settle this long-running controversy.

""We still don't have perfect answers,"" says Dr. Elizabeth Pearce, a well-known endocrinologist at Boston Medical Center, where a recent survey found widespread prenatal thyroid testing. But, ""if it's my patient in my office, or it's me or my family member, I'm going to treat every time.""

Obstetricians seem more wary.

""There are studies on both sides of the fence,"" says Dr. Dena Goffman of New York's Montefiore Medical Center, which tests only women at high risk. ""If you don't know what to do with the results, you probably shouldn't order the test,"" she said.

The unassuming thyroid — a small bow tie-shaped gland nestled in the front of the neck — plays a big role in good health for everyone. It produces hormones that regulate metabolism and can affect almost every type of tissue in the body. About 20 million Americans are estimated to have a malfunctioning thyroid that, if serious enough, can contribute to heart disease, bone-thinning osteoporosis and infertility.

An overactive thyroid, called hyperthyroidism, speeds up bodily functions, causing such symptoms as weight loss, nervousness, anxiety and increased heart rate and vision problems.

Much more common is an underactive thyroid, called hypothyroidism. It slows body functions, causing such problems as fatigue, weight gain, depression, constipation and dry skin. It even can contribute to high cholesterol, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Thyroid problems increase with age, but they affect far more women than men — and pregnancy puts extra stress on the gland.

Having enough thyroid hormones is important for fetal brain development, especially during the first trimester, when the fetus depends solely on the mother for them. The hormones also play a role in avoiding miscarriage or premature birth.

Mothers also may harbor immune system cells called antibodies that subtly attack the gland and likewise are linked to miscarriage and prematurity. Italian researchers found that treating those women lowered their risk of encountering this problem.

There is broad agreement that women with overt hypothyroidism — a seriously underactive gland — should be treated, most likely given a once-a-day hormone pill long known to be safe in pregnancy. But it takes blood testing to diagnose overt disease because even those women don't always report the vague symptoms.

Those $25 blood tests are sure to uncover women with mild hypothyroidism, too, the people in the so-called gray zone. Some research has raised questions about whether mild cases really pose a pregnancy risk, and preliminary results from a large British study recently found no overall IQ benefit to the resulting children if their mothers had been treated.

But the damage might already have been done by the time treatment began late in the first trimester, notes Boston's Pearce. In the U.S., doctors are anxiously awaiting a similar National Institutes of Health study; results aren't expected until 2015.

What's the advice until then? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends testing only pregnant women who have thyroid symptoms, have had previous thyroid problems, or have similar autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes — those considered at risk for overt disease.

The American Thyroid Association goes further. Last summer it advised also testing all pregnant women age 30 and older, and those with enlarged thyroids, previous pregnancy problems or those who are obese, says Pearce, who co-authored the guidelines.

Most guidelines cite the lack of evidence for treating mild cases. The thyroid association does urge treatment if those women harbor the worrisome antibodies.

A final tip: Pregnant women should check that their prenatal vitamins contain iodine, important for proper thyroid function, Pearce says. Not all do. Most Americans get enough iodine from dairy products, bread, seafood and iodized table salt. But women need extra during pregnancy.

MONDAY, Jan. 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Spinal manipulation and home exercise are more effective at relieving neck pain in the long term than medications, according to new research.

People undergoing spinal manipulation therapy for neck pain also reported greater satisfaction than people receiving medication or doing home exercises.

""We found that there are some viable treatment options for neck pain,"" said Gert Bronfort, vice president of research at the Wolfe-Harris Center for Clinical Studies at Northwestern Health Sciences University in Bloomington, Minn.

""What we don't really know yet is how to individualize these treatments for each particular patient. All are probably still viable treatment options, but what we don't know is what each particular patient will need,"" Bronfort said, adding that it's possible a combination of treatments might be helpful, too.

Results of the study are published in the Jan. 3 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine. Funding for the study was provided by the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

Neck pain is an extremely common problem. About three-quarters of adults report having neck pain at some point in their lives, according to background information in the study. Neck pain is responsible for millions of health care visits each year, and it can have a negative impact on quality of life.

Spinal manipulation is one type of treatment that's offered for neck pain, and it can be administered by chiropractors, physical therapists, osteopaths and other health care providers, according to the study.

But, there isn't much evidence for treating neck pain with spinal manipulation. There also isn't a great deal of information on how effective medications or home exercise programs are for treating neck pain, the researchers noted.

Bronfort and colleagues thought that spinal manipulation might prove to be more effective than medications or home exercise therapy. To test their hypothesis, they recruited 272 people between the ages of 18 and 65 who had neck pain. Their neck pain had no known cause, such as a trauma or pinched nerve, and the patients been experiencing the pain for between two and 12 weeks when the study began.

The study volunteers were randomly selected for one of three treatment groups. One group received spinal manipulations over a 12-week period. Each individual was allowed to choose the number of spinal manipulations they felt they needed.

The second group received medications, both over the counter and prescription, depending on their needs. First-line medications included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or acetaminophen (Tylenol). If people didn't get relief from these drugs, narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants were offered.

The third group was assigned two one-hour sessions of home exercise. The goal of the home-exercise program was to improve movement in the neck area. Participants were instructed to do the exercises six to eight times per day.

At the 12th week, 82 percent of people receiving spinal manipulation reported at least a 50 percent reduction in pain, compared with 69 percent of those on medication and 77 percent doing home exercises. Also at week 12, of people receiving spinal manipulation, 32 percent reported feeling a 100 percent reduction in pain, compared with 13 percent on medications and 30 percent doing home exercises.

At one year, 27 percent of those receiving spinal manipulation said they felt a 100 percent reduction in pain versus 17 percent of those on medications and 37 percent of those doing home exercises.

""For me, as an ER doctor, this study offers an interesting perspective,"" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an attending physician in emergency medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""It's a small study, but it found that home exercises and spinal manipulation were effective. So, should we be referring to physical therapists, osteopaths or chiropractors from the ER?""

""This study shows that basically neck pain will get better on its own,"" said Dr. Victor Khabie, chief of the departments of surgery and sports medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. ""It would've been good if they had a no-treatment group, too,"" he added.

""Everyone heals differently. There are different pathways to healing, and whether you feel you're better off with chiropractic, home exercises or medications, this study shows that all three are basically just as effective. Whatever your pathway to healing, in about six to eight weeks, you should start to feel better,"" said Khabie.

He also noted that it's important for anyone receiving spinal manipulation to know that there are rare, but serious risks that can occur with neck manipulations.

All three experts said anyone experiencing neck pain needs to have it evaluated to make sure there isn't a serious or correctable cause of the pain. This is especially true if you've been in a car accident, or if you have any neurological symptoms, such as repeatedly dropping things, or if you have pain radiating down your arm.

story_reviews_00949,"Scientists are finding more clues to help determine whether people with mild dementia symptoms are at risk for Alzheimer's.

A new study suggests that biomarkers found in cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain and acts as a protective cushion) could predict who would develop Alzheimer's disease 90% of the time among patients with mild cognitive impairment, a condition characterized by measurable memory problems.

Researchers report these findings in the journal Archives of General Psychiatry.

This is the longest clinical follow-up ever of patients who begin with mild cognitive impairment, researchers reported. Patients were tracked from four to 12 years, with a median of 9.2 years. The research builds on a 2006 Lancet Neurology study that followed patients for a median of 5.2 years, beginning with a group of 137 volunteers with mild cognitive impairment.The new study is important because of the long follow-up period, according to Adam Brickman, assistant professor of neuropsychology at Columbia University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.

Knowing which patient with mild cognitive impairment patients may go on to develop Alzheimer's is vital information for researchers, who are looking for treatments for the fatal brain disease. The current thinking is that interventions will be most effective when given to a patient as early as possible, Brickman said. Clinical trials can better focus their efforts if patients are known to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Generally, about 30% to 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment show evidence of underlying symptoms of Alzheimer's, so not everyone with this condition is a good candidate for an Alzheimer's trial.

Researchers focused on two biomarkers previously thought to be involved in Alzheimer's disease: a kind of protein called beta-amyloid, and another protein type called tau. Experts believe a decrease in beta-amyloid in the fluid of the spinal cord is associated with a toxic buildup of that protein in the brain, which causes the formation of plaques linked to Alzheimer's disease. Tau has been tied to neurofibrillary tangles in the brain; researchers find that an increase in tau in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with Alzheimer's also.

The results from the study suggest that beta-amyloid is a much earlier predictor of Alzheimer's disease than tau, which supports the hypothesis that beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain occurs first in the course of the disease.

Some of the participants, who were originally found to be stable with mild cognitive impairment after about five years, went on to develop Alzheimer's disease during the longer follow-up. That suggests that a five-year follow-up period is not long enough to determine how well biomarkers can predict which patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, researchers say.

The association between biomarkers in the fluid and Alzheimer's was also described in studies in December 2009 and August 2010, building on the idea that a spinal tap could be useful in predicting Alzheimer's.

When these sorts of studies get published, Brickman and other doctors get phone calls from aging adults wondering whether they should be getting spinal taps to assess their risk. But it's too early to use this as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings, says Brickman. Down the road, the ""fantasy"" is that asymptomatic people will be able to get a biomarker test to determine whether they'll one day get Alzheimer's, but that's not possible right now, he adds.

""What I tell people is: If they’re worried about their thinking abilities, that they should make an appointment with a neuropsychology or a neurologist to get an evaluation,"" Brinkman says. ""The way we diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is by evaluating the behavior and the risk factor medical profile, not by looking at biological markers at this point.""

As scientists gain more insight into predicting Alzheimer's, aging adults may struggle with the question of whether they want to know their risk, especially since there's still no cure. Some people want to enroll in clinical trials as soon as they start showing symptoms; others would rather be ignorant of their status since there is no cure. In looking for treatments, however, researchers depend on people's willingness to contribute to science.

MONDAY, Jan. 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A small study suggests that deep brain stimulation, which is currently being investigated as a treatment for general depression, may also help patients with bipolar disorder.

There are some caveats. The surgery necessary to allow deep brain stimulation is extremely expensive. And for now, the research is preliminary, so it's too early to know for sure if the treatment is appropriate to be used for any kind of depression.

Still, the study suggests that brain stimulation ""not only just helps patients who haven't been able to recover from depression, but it seems to be associated with the absence of relapses. They're not only getting better, they're staying better,"" said study co-author Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor in both the departments of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and neurology, at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.

In deep brain stimulation, surgeons insert wires into the brain that allows a specific region to be continuously hit with an electronic pulse. The level of stimulation is controlled by a pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest.

Deep brain stimulation has been around for more than 20 years, Mayberg said, and is commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. The cost of the surgery is about $50,000, she said.

Previous research by Mayberg and others suggested that deep brain stimulation had potential as a treatment for depression. The St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation company, which has provided consulting fees to Mayberg and some of the other study authors, is currently recruiting patients for a study that could pave the way for its approval as a treatment for depression, Mayberg said.

The new study, which appears online Jan. 2 in the Archives of General Psychiatry, began with 10 patients with depression and seven with bipolar disorder -- a condition that causes severe mood swings and is also known as manic depression. They all received deep brain stimulation for 24 weeks after going through four weeks either with or without stimulation.

Most of the patients continued to receive the treatment over two years, although researchers temporarily turned it off in three of them as part of the study before realizing that doing so caused their depression to return.

The researchers found that 18 percent of patients went into remission after 24 weeks, 36 percent (of 14 patients) after one year. After two years, of the 12 patients still in the study, seven patients (58 percent) were in remission.

""The number of patients who got better increased over time, but it's not quite clear as to why,"" Mayberg said. The workings of deep brain stimulation as a whole are a mystery, although Mayberg said it may work by changing the brain's rhythms.

Patients didn't suffer from side effects, she noted.

So, what's next?

Dr. Samuel James Collier, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Austin, predicted that even if deep brain stimulation turns out to be an effective treatment for depression, it'll be far from the first line of defense.

""Medications and ECT -- electroconvulsive therapy -- are clearly safer, better tolerated, and do not embody a large surgical risk,"" Collier said. ""I can't think of a scenario where deep brain stimulation would be considered even remotely before medications and ECT were exhausted.""

Still, he said, it's important to note that ""we seem to be making progress and hopefully those who are suffering the most can find solace in that and not give up hope.""

For now, research continues. If patients are interested in deep brain stimulation treatment, they should try to get into the study that's ongoing, Mayberg said.

THURSDAY, Dec. 29, 2011 (HealthDay News) --Concentrating on music can provide enough distraction to ease the pain of people with significant anxiety, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of Utah Pain Research Center studied the effectiveness of music as a pain reliever on 143 study participants. The volunteers were asked to follow a melody so they could identify the tones that stood out. While tackling the assignment, they received safe pain shocks with fingertip electrodes.

The study, published in the December issue of the Journal of Pain, found that pain was reduced as the demands of the music task rose. The researchers explained that the music competed with the participants' pain pathways. By triggering emotional responses and engaging the participants' minds, the music task helped to ease their pain.

Participants with the most anxiety about the pain became more engrossed in the music-listening task than those who were less anxious, according to a journal news release. The study authors suggested that experiencing little anxiety lowered the participants' ability to focus on the task.

The researchers concluded that people with a lot of anxiety who can become preoccupied by activities, such as listening to music, can reduce discomfort by using this type of pain-relief strategy.

Doctors should take patients' personality traits into consideration before suggesting pain therapies such as music, the authors said.

story_reviews_00952,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a new study of middle-aged New Jersey men, taking cholesterol-lowering drugs was linked to a lower chance of dying from prostate cancer.

The findings don’t prove that the drugs, called statins, ward off aggressive cancer. But they jibe with previous studies suggesting that getting cholesterol levels under control might help reduce the risk of life-threatening disease, researchers said.

“People may be on these medications for their heart, but it may actually be doing them some good for their prostate,” said study author Dr. Stephen Marcella, from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in New Brunswick.

“If a person’s on the fence about taking a statin medication for their heart, this is another potential benefit they may have by taking one of these,” he told Reuters Health.

Marcella and his colleagues collected the medical records of 380 men who had died of prostate cancer and another 380 of the same age and race without prostate cancer or with non-lethal cancer.

Most of the men were white and in their mid- to late-60s, on average. Close to one in four of the men in both groups combined had ever taken a statin.

The researchers found that men who died of prostate cancer were half as likely to have taken a statin at any time, and for any duration, than men in the “control” group.

When they accounted for whether or not men were overweight and their other health problems and medications, it turned out that those with fatal cancers were 63 percent less likely to have ever taken a statin, according to findings published in Cancer.

But, Marcella added, “I would not tell a person if they don’t have a risk of heart disease, (if) they don’t have hypertension...to take a statin just to prevent lethal prostate cancer.”

The evidence that’s effective, he said, just isn’t there yet.

And even if statins do turn out to help prevent fatal prostate cancer, researchers said, previous studies have suggested they don’t lower a man’s risk of getting less aggressive forms of the disease.

According to the American Cancer Society, about one in every six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point, and one in every 36 men will die of the disease.

Marcella’s team didn’t have the data to figure out if taking a statin for longer, or starting one earlier, was more beneficial than more limited use of the drugs.

‘VERY TRICKY TO SORT OUT’

The researchers also couldn’t tell whether men started using statins before or after they were diagnosed with aggressive cancer.

But they did find that while high-potency, often newer statins were linked to a lower risk of fatal prostate cancer, lower-potency drugs were not. That suggests it’s something about the drugs themselves that lower men’s chances of dying from prostate cancer, Marcella said.

Statins may protect against fatal prostate cancer through their known cholesterol-lowering effects, said Dr. Stephen Freedland, who studies prostate cancer at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, but wasn’t involved in the new study.

He said that cholesterol is a “key nutrient” for cancer cells, so lower cholesterol levels in the body could prevent more aggressive forms of cancer from developing.

But it’s also possible that statins don’t prevent certain cancers at all, Freedland said, and it’s something else about men who take statins — for example, if they also change their diet and start exercising — that explains their lower risk of fatal cancer.

“It gets very, very tricky to sort out,” Freedland told Reuters Health.

To prove that statins protect against aggressive cancer would require a large study in which cancer-free men, or those with early-stage disease, are randomly assigned to take statins or not and then tracked for years to see how many of them die from cancer.

That type of study, especially involving healthy, disease-free men, would be very expensive and time consuming, said Dr. Nelly Tan, from the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied statins and prostate cancer risk.

About one-quarter of adults age 45 and older in the U.S. take statins to lower cholesterol and protect against heart attacks. The drugs run anywhere from $11 to more than $200 per month, and sometimes cause side effects including muscle pain, nausea and gas and liver dysfunction.

Researchers agreed that until there’s clearer evidence for benefit, men with healthy hearts shouldn’t seek out statin prescriptions for the purpose of lowering their prostate cancer risks.

But Freedland said that other strategies for lowering cholesterol — such as eating better and exercising regularly — are ways almost everyone can lower their disease risks in the meantime.

TUESDAY, Dec. 27, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A new test measuring levels of troponin I in the blood may help determine whether someone is really having a heart attack earlier than is currently possible.

Troponin I is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle has been damaged such as during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Researchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.

The new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours.

The study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics. Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study.

""We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,"" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. ""If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack.""

Many people come to the emergency room with chest pain. Typically, the doctor orders an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart, along with blood work. Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained. This is where the blood test would be used.

""It is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant,"" she said. A more sensitive test could save a lot of money, she noted.

Dr. Michael Lanigan, an emergency room doctor at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NYC, said the ultimate goal is a highly specific and sensitive test that can tell doctors right away if you are having a heart attack. The new test ""helps push the envelope further,"" he said. ""We need a blood test that can tell people when they walk in or soon thereafter that they are having a heart attack because the sooner you make the diagnosis, the sooner you can start the right therapy.""

story_reviews_00954,"LONDON (Reuters) - A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives, a study found on Tuesday.

Italian researchers writing in the journal of the International Menopause Society, Climacteric, said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of DHEA can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms, suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

But they stressed that the trial was small, so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results.

“We must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample,” Anna Fenton, co-editor of Climacteric, said in commentary on the work. “We can’t yet say that this study means that DHEA is a viable alternative to HRT, but ... we should be looking to do larger studies to confirm these initial results.”

DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a natural steroid hormone mostly made in the adrenal glands and has a variety of therapeutic uses.

HRT, which is a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, is an approved treatment for women going through the menopause, who often experience unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, loss of sex drive and mood swings.

But sales of HRT drugs have fallen sharply since a large study in 2002 found higher rates of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and strokes in women who took the pills, and the search has since been on for alternatives.

American researchers said in January that the antidepressant Lexapro, made by drugmaker Forest Laboratories, significantly cut the number and severity of hot flushes in menopausal women, and other antidepressants including GlaxoSmithKline’s Paxil and the Pfizer drugs Prozac and Effexor also have been found to be effective.

For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms.

Over a year, 12 women took vitamin D and calcium, 12 took DHEA, 12 took standard HRT and 12 took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms.

The women’s menopausal symptoms, sexual interest and activity were measured using a standard questionnaire that explores factors such as satisfaction with frequency of sex, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, and sexual partner.

After 12 months, all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms, but those taking vitamin D and calcium did not show any significant improvement.

At the start of the trial, all groups had similar sexual activity, but after the year, those taking calcium and vitamin D scored an average of 34.9 on the questionnaire scale, while those taking DHEA had a score of 48.6, showing that those on DHEA had more sexual interest and activity.

The results for the HRT group were similar, and both the HRT DHEA groups showed a higher level of sexual intercourse in comparison to the control group, the researchers said.

Genazzani said the results showed DHEA has potential, especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional HRT. “But this is a small study, a proof of concept. What we need to do now is to look at a larger study, to confirm that these initial results are valid,” she added.",DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study,2,Reuters Health
story_reviews_00955,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Treating stroke patients who have lost control and awareness of one side of their body with magnetic stimulation to the brain may improve their symptoms, researchers said today.

In a new, small study published in the journal Neurology, patients who were given quick bursts of stimulation over a couple of weeks improved by about 20 percent on tests of vision and attention, while those who got a fake stimulation treatment didn’t improve significantly.

But researchers said it’s still unclear what types of patients might benefit from the treatment and by how much.

About half of people who have a stroke end up with difficulty processing or reacting to things on one side of their body, most often on the left side after a stroke in the right side of the brain, said Dr. Anna Barrett, director of stroke rehabilitation research at the Kessler Foundation in West Orange, New Jersey, who wasn’t involved in the new study. That post-stroke condition is known as neglect.

“People that have that tend to do much worse in their eventual recovery,” Barrett said. “They’re less likely to become completely independent.”

Most of those patients can improve with therapy and exercises, she said, but the process is often slow, and keeping people in the hospital during it is costly.

She said that because of that, the new findings are “promising,” but added that brain stimulation is still an experimental technique, and not ready to be used as part of normal stroke rehabilitation.

For the study, Italian researchers randomly assigned 20 patients with neglect to get real or fake magnetic stimulation in ten sessions over two weeks, in addition to their conventional rehab program. The treatment involved an electromagnetic coil placed over the left side of the brain that transmitted pulses of electrical currents.

Similar types of stimulation treatment are used in some patients with depression or during spinal surgery, according to Barrett. The device costs about $50,000.

Nine people in each group completed all the treatment sessions.

Before treatment, right after and another two weeks later, stroke patients were given tests to measure their visual-spatial skills, as well as attention and concentration. Those including drawing and shape-copying tests, as well as menu reading and map navigating tasks.

Patients in both groups started out with an average mark of about 170 on the tests, which are scored from 0 to 227 combined.

The “real” magnetic stimulation group improved by about 16 percent right after the treatment and 23 percent at the later time point, while there was no significant benefit seen in patients given the fake stimulation.

The researchers said that it’s not clear what the amount of improvement they observed would mean for patients in their daily lives.

But, lead author Dr. Giacomo Koch said, “What we found is that the improvement was more marked in those patients that were more impaired.”

Koch, from the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, told Reuters Health he thinks those patients with more severe problems would likely see a benefit outside of just test results.

He said that larger studies at multiple treatment sites are needed to determine how helpful magnetic stimulation can be in stroke recovery. But he was optimistic about the treatment’s future.

“I think in a few years this could become another tool that could be used systematically in the neurorehabilitation wards,” Koch said. He added that the treatment isn’t painful, and only takes a few minutes for each session.

Close to 800,000 people in the U.S. suffer a stroke each year, mostly older adults. For those with neglect, doctors typically prescribe cognitive rehabilitation, in which therapists teach skills and help the patient become more aware of the affected side of the body.

Barrett, also from the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, said that she wonders whether stimulation could help patients achieve the goals that are most important to regaining independence after a stroke, such as using the bathroom.

It’s also not clear if the treatment might help most neglect patients, or if the findings only apply to certain groups, she told Reuters Health.

The ideal option might end up being a combination treatment that involves stimulation in certain patients and other therapies that address a range of skills important for regaining function, Barrett added. But, she said, “That all remains to be investigated.”

story_reviews_00956,"Dec. 14, 2011 -- It can be an all too common scenario for certain stroke survivors. They can’t see or recognize anything on one side of their body.

This condition often occurs after a stroke on the right side of the brain and is typically treated with a combination of physical therapy and brain retraining or mental tasks using a pen and paper or computer. This is often not enough to make a meaningful improvement.

Now new research in Neurology suggests that stimulating the nerve cells in the brain with magnet therapy may aid recovery. During transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a doctor places a large magnetic coil against the patient’s scalp, which creates electric currents to stimulate nerve cells.

After a stroke, one side of the brain can become overactive and its circuits can get overloaded. Enter TMS. This therapy may restore balance between the two sides of the brain.

And according to the new study, it helps.

Ten out of 20 people who faced this problem following a stroke received the magnet therapy daily for two weeks. The other 10 received a fake treatment. All participants also did standard brain retraining.

Everyone took tests that measured their abilities after the study and then again two weeks later. The tests measured line crossing and figure- and shape-copying ability. The tests also measured activities of daily living affected by neglect, such as dialing numbers on a phone, reading a menu, and sorting coins.

Overall, participants who received the magnet therapy improved by 16.3% immediately following treatment and by 22.6% two weeks later. There were no improvements seen in test scores of those who got the other treatment.

The overactive brain circuits also improved among people who got the TMS treatment, the study showed.

Researcher Giacomo Koch, MD, PhD, of the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, Italy, and colleagues point out that the changes could be the combined effects of the mental tasks and the TMS.",Magnet Therapy May Help Some Stroke Survivors Recover,4,Stroke
story_reviews_00957,"How miserable is combing a child's hair, lock by lock, to pick off head lice? So miserable that some parents are buying $30 shampoos and other washes that promise to ward off the tiny, grayish bugs.

The parents get peace of mind that they are doing something. Conveniently for the product makers, there's no way to tell if they kept lice at bay, or if children wouldn't have gotten lice anyway. Makers say sales are growing fast.

No one tracks the number of head-lice infestations nationwide. The most recent estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1997, says six million to 12 million children ages 3 to 12 get lice each year, though some experts say the incidence rate is much lower. Still, most U.S. school districts report at least one head-lice case a year.

Jennifer Crocker is worried her two daughters, ages 7 and 11, could get head lice. Three classes at their elementary school have reported outbreaks of the tiny critters so far this school year. A friend's daughter has already gotten them twice.

The head louse, pictured, prefers a clean scalp and only spreads by head-to-head contact. Some 'super lice' have evolved to resist chemical treatments to kill them. Getty Images

So Ms. Crocker, a 42-year-old, stay-at home mother from Oakville, Wash., makes sure her daughters' hair gets lathered every other day with Rosemary Repel shampoo and conditioner, which maker Fairy Tales Hair Care Inc. claims prevents the bugs from nestling onto kids' heads.

""My kids are bug-free"" after three years of shampooing and conditioning, she says.

Contrary to popular belief, head lice like clean, not dirty, scalps. The wingless bugs can't hop, jump or fly—they can only crawl. They spread solely by direct head-to-head contact. They don't harm children, but they are awfully itchy.

When kids do get lice, beating off the infestation isn't easy. So-called super lice have grown resistant to the chemicals in traditional treatments. Parents may use over-the-counter shampoos or creams, prescription treatments containing pesticides, or visit salons that comb hair and pick out the nits.

Zippity Doo's Styling Gel for Children ($9.99) contains lemongrass, Tea Tree oil and other plant-based ingredients. Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel ($11.95) is sold at salons. Lice Shield shampoo and conditioner ($6-$17) contains extracts of citronella, eucalyptus, rosemary and lemongrass. F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal Styling by Anne Cardenas

Sales of prescription lice treatments—used once the bugs have taken hold—rose to $73.8 million last year, up 15% from 2006, according to research firm IMS Health Inc. Sales of over-the-counter lice treatments—which include preventive and removal products—grew 11% over the past five years to $78.9 million for the year ended Nov. 27, according to Chicago-based market researcher SymphonyIRI Group, whose figures don't include Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Fairy Tales Hair Care sells shampoos, conditioners and bottled lice repellent sprays through its website and at beauty retailers and hair salons. The company, based in Passaic, N.J., says ingredients such as rosemary, citronella and tea tree oils coat hair follicles, repelling lice.

""Rosemary is really the first line of defense against head lice,"" says Fairy Tales founder Risa Barash, who launched the company in 1999 out of a salon for children owned by a relative. ""It's proven. It's safe.""

Ms. Barash cites a 2004 study published in the Israel Medical Association Journal showing citronella—an ingredient in Fairy Tale products—repels head lice. Previous research, also done in Israel, showed lice avoided tufts of hair immersed in essential oils like citronella, rosemary and eucalyptus.

If the products didn't work, ""why would we have such a large following of repeat customers?,"" Ms. Barash says.

Ms. Barash says sales of its items, which range from $11 to $30 a bottle, have risen 36% year-to-date, thanks in part to a new salon distribution deal reached with cosmetics titan L'Oreal SA at the start of this year.

Babo Botanicals' Rosemary Tea Tree Lice Repel Shampoo ($15.95) is one of several products promising to fend off lice with rosemary and other organic ingredients. F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal

Lornamead Inc.'s Lice Shield leave-in spray and combined shampoo and conditioner products are sold nationally by Wal-Mart, CVS Caremark Corp. and Rite Aid Corp. Zippity Doo's, a division of Laurus Enterprises LLC, sells its shampoos, hair gels and spray at some U.S. drugstore chains and through the websites of Target Corp. and Walgreen Co. The company declined to specify figures, but says 2011 sales have so far quadrupled last year's total. Newer entrants like Babo Botanicals LLC, Happyheads Services LLC and So Cozy Hair Care for Children LLC sell their products at hair salons across the country.

Terri Pitts, a 42-year-old branding consultant in New York City, has used most of the Fairy Tale products over the past year on her five-year-old daughter. She likens lice prevention to wearing a bike helmet. It's a ""no brainer,"" she says. ""Why should a kid miss school because of head lice?""

Some public-health experts and school nursing groups are skeptical about the lice-prevention products, citing a lack of formal evidence. The National Association of School Nurses says in a position paper to its members that, based on several research pediatric, dermatology and nursing journal articles, the preventive products have presented ""little scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness.""

""There are lots of things that work in the lab, but not in the field,"" says John Clark, a University of Massachusetts professor of veterinary and animal sciences.

Richard Pollack, an entomology instructor and insect expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, estimates that only about 200,000 elementary-school students actually get head lice each year, rather than the six to 12 million children from the CDC's 1997 estimates. In an email, a CDC spokeswoman said its figures were based on sales of head-lice treatments, noting a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics published last year that said the totals were most likely an overestimation.

Most louse diagnosis is wrong, with dandruff or food crumbs confused for nits or eggs, Mr. Pollack says. He says he is skeptical that the lice-prevention products are any more effective than regular shampoos or conditioners.

""These companies might as well claim that their products repel alligators,"" he says.

The only surefire way to tell if a child has lice is to spot one of the crawling critters, say experts, who recommend parents frequently check their children's scalps and comb their hair weekly. Girls can wear their hair up and tight.

Nancy Polanco turned to the Internet after receiving a letter about a lice outbreak at her 7-year-old daughter's school. She found Zippity Doo's website and started using its leave-in conditioner, shampoo and protective spray. She blogged about her experience, saying lice ""don't like the smell"" of the preventive shampoos ""and are less likely to stick around."" The posts have drawn more than 2,400 hits, with more readers each day, says Ms. Polanco, a 27-year-old nursing assistant from Windsor, Ontario.

story_reviews_00958,"The delivery virus, carrying a good version of the human gene for the clotting agent known as Factor IX, was prepared by researchers at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions.

Hemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy.

Women who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States.

Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently.

Treating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial “a landmark study.”

The patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in.

“We attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,” Dr. Tuddenham said.

The patient cannot be injected again with the same virus because his immune system is now primed to attack it. “He’s very philosophic about it, but he’s a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,” Dr. Tuddenham said.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. “We are pretty close to the sweet spot,” he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B “could be available for widespread use in a couple of years.”

In a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus.

“I think it’s incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,” she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients’ sperm and make the change hereditary.

A serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani’s team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice.

“I don’t think it’s a showstopper, but it’s a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,” Dr. High said.

Patients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last.

About 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII. Researchers have focused on hemophilia B, in part, because the Factor IX gene is much smaller and easier to work with.",Hemophilia B Gene Therapy Breakthrough,4,New York Times

TUESDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News)-- Women who get routine mammograms can lower their risk of dying from breast cancer by nearly half, a new Dutch study suggests.

""Our study adds further to the evidence that mammography screening unambiguously reduces breast cancer mortality,"" said Dr. Suzie Otto, a senior researcher in the department of public health at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The routine screening also lowered the chances of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer, she said.

The study appears online Dec. 6 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.

Mammography screening, including the best schedule and the best age to begin, is being hotly debated in the United States and elsewhere. Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.

Otto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.

Among the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.

Advanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.

Women who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.

The greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.

The study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,"" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""This study focuses on survival.""

The study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.

Mammography does lead to ''overtreatment"" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman's lifetime. ""But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,"" she said.

story_reviews_00960,"A new gene test may spare thousands of women with a common type of breast tumor from unnecessary radiation, according to a study released today at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium .

The test, which analyzes 12 genes from a woman's tumor, helps predict which cases are most likely to be aggressive — requiring both surgery and radiation — and which are likely to be slow-growing, requiring surgery alone, says lead researcher Lawrence Solin, chairman of radiation oncology at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia.

""This is a perfect example of how understanding the human genome can be translated into real life, to help real women,"" Solin says. ""This is a very exciting advance.""

The test, from Genomic Health, aims to help the more than 45,000 American women a year diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. While some doctors consider the tumors to be very early breast cancers, other experts regard them as precancers. Although these tumors are confined to the milk ducts, they have the potential to invade the rest of the breast.

Until now, however, doctors haven't had a good way to tell which cases of DCIS are the most likely to spread, Solin says. Women with the condition often are treated as if they have a more advanced cancer, with lumpectomy and radiation, and sometimes years of hormonal therapies. In the case of DCIS, radiation reduces the risk of developing another tumor in the same breast, but doesn't improve survival, says Steve Shak, Genomic Health's chief medical officer.

And while radiation is generally safe, it can burn the skin and damage the underlying heart and lung tissue, Shak says. Going to radiation treatments also is time-consuming, requiring daily visits for five to seven weeks, Solin says.

The study shows that about 75% of women fall into the ""low-risk"" category, according to their gene profiles. After 10 years, only 5% of these women developed an invasive cancer — a more serious type that had advanced beyond the milk ducts — in the same breast.

Yet 11% of women fell into the ""high-risk"" group. About 19% of these women developed an invasive breast cancer within 10 years.

Women and their doctors may want to use this information to guide their treatment, Shak says. A similar test for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer has been available since 2004. That test, Oncotype DX, helps predict which patients may be able to skip chemotherapy, contributing to a 20% drop in chemo use, Shak says. Genomic Health plans to make the DCIS test available by the end of the year. Although the gene test isn't cheap — its current cost is $4,175 — it could still save money, he says. Radiation therapy can cost more than $21,000.

""For women who really don't want radiation therapy or a mastectomy, this might well be a way to determine whether they 'should take the risk,' "" says surgeon Susan Love, president of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. ""It is the first step to being able to figure out which DCIS is important and which is not.""

Some cancer specialists aren't ready to change their practice, however. Eric Winer of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn't involved in the new study, says he'd like to see additional studies before using the test to advise patients.

""It makes everyone more comfortable to sit with the data for a little while to understand it, rather than rush out and start using it,"" Winer says. ""People will need to think it through.""

Jackie Fox, who was diagnosed with DCIS three years ago, says she welcomes tests that can help women make difficult decisions. Fox, 55, of Omaha, initially hoped to have a lumpectomy and radiation. After the smaller surgeries were unable to completely remove her cancer, however, she agreed to a mastectomy. ""It just seemed so drastic to me, for something that I was told was not life-threatening,"" Fox says. ""If we could reach the point where women didn't have to wonder anymore, where they didn't have to second-guess, that would be wonderful.""",Gene test could assist cancer therapy,4,Cancer

The antidepressant Prozac may alleviate repetitive behavior and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in adults with autism, reducing these defining symptoms of the disorder, according to new research.

The research, which included 37 high-functioning autistic adults, mainly diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, followed participants for 12 weeks. Taking Prozac (fluoxetine) doubled the chances that a patient would show overall improvement, measured by their clinicians. Half of the participants taking Prozac had significant reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms, compared with 8% taking placebo. Side effects were mild to moderate and participants taking Prozac did not show increases in suicidal thoughts or ideas.

“Repetitive behavior is a core symptom of the illness,” says lead author Dr. Eric Hollander, medical director of the Autism and Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, explaining that “from a very early age, these children have rituals and routines. For example, they like to line up their toys and they get very bent out of shape if there is any deviation.”

MORE: What Does a 400% Increase in Antidepressant Use Really Mean?

A previous, larger study of a similar medication, Celexa (citalopram), in autistic children did not find a reduction in repetitive behaviors, but the drug did reduce irritability and was superior to placebo among children who had the highest levels of irritability. Irritability can sometimes lead to repetitive behaviors because autistic people often engage in these activities to soothe themselves.

Both Prozac and Celexa belong to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Prior research on SSRIs in autistic people has also looked at Luvox (fluvoxamine) and found a reduction in repetitive behavior in adults but not children. It is not known if the differences between these studies are due to differences between the medications or other factors.

Obsessive behaviors may also arise in autistic people in response to the stress or discomfort of unpredictable situations. “Many of these individuals have expectations for what’s going to happen, and if there is an unexpected deviation, they experience a lot of discomfort and then they do all these kinds of behaviors,” says Hollander. That’s why people with autism may obsessively avoid locations where they previously experienced discomfort, for example, or they may engage in a repetitive habit like washing, checking, counting, touching or tapping.

When taking Prozac, Hollander says, “Patients acknowledge experiencing less discomfort. They’re more able to go outside their comfort zone and to better resist their habits and rituals.” One participant in Hollander’s study was previously too anxious to take the subway or eat in a restaurant, but, when taking Prozac, was able to tolerate these unpredictable environments.

“It takes the edge off,” Hollander explains, noting that the findings were statistically significant and clinically meaningful. “The clinicians could tell that people were doing better not only in terms of OCD symptoms but overall distress and ability to function.”

MORE: Why Are So Many Foster Care Children Taking Antipsychotics?

The only drugs approved to treat irritability and repetitive behaviors in autistic children are the atypical antipsychotics Risperdal (risperidone) and Abilify (aripiprazole), which tend to have more severe side effects than Prozac does. Those drugs carry significant risk for weight gain, diabetes and movement disorders.

Responding to the research, Yale Child Study Center director Fred Volkmar told WebMD: “The question remains, ‘Is fluoxetine better than risperidone for this symptom?’ It would be interesting to see studies comparing these two drugs head to head.”

Hollander has previously received funding from pharmaceutical companies, but the current study was paid for by a grant from the Food and Drug Administration’s “orphan” drug program. That program funds research on rare conditions with new drugs or those no longer patented that are not likely to be pursued by industry. When the research was originally funded, Hollander says, autism was considered to be a rare condition.

The study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

This condition occurs when the cushions, or discs, that serve as shock absorbers for the spine become inflamed and bulge or break open. When inflamed, discs press against nearby nerves. People with this condition can experience pain, numbness, and weakness in the back, buttocks, and legs.

None of the people in this study had been helped by other nonsurgical therapies, and supporters say the new therapy could become a standard treatment for such patients. But a back pain specialist who spoke to WebMD says that further research is needed.

In the study, 119 people (37%) reported no pain at six months. About another third reported less frequent episodes of low back pain, ""maybe once a day,"" says researcher Thomas Lehnert, MD, an assistant professor of radiology at Frankfurt University in Germany.

Another 22% reported only a little improvement, with pain persisting. And 7% had no improvement or their pain got worse. A few patients resorted to back surgery.

Still, ozone therapy could even help many patients with unrelenting back pain to avoid surgery, Lehnert tells WebMD. Before the treatment, patients had tried everything without success and were considering an operation, he says.

Studies suggest that ozone therapy works by reducing inflammation, shrinking herniated discs, and relieving pressure on the nerves bringing pain signals to the brain. The steroid further reduces inflammation.

WEDNESDAY, Nov. 30, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Eating baked or broiled fish as little as once a week may boost brain health and lower the risk for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, new brain scan research suggests.

The study authors found that eating baked and broiled fish -- but not fried -- helps to preserve gray matter neurons, strengthening them in areas of the brain deemed critical to memory and cognition.

""Those who eat baked or broiled fish had larger brains,"" noted study author Dr. Cyrus Raji, a resident in the department of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Mercy Hospital. ""They had larger brain cells in areas of the brain responsible for memory and learning. And the reason that's important is that these brain areas are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.""

In those people with larger brain volume, ""the risk for Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment went down by fivefold within five years following the brain scans we conducted,"" he said.

Raji said he was ""amazed"" that this effect was seen with eating fish as little as one to four times a week. ""We're talking about just a half serving a day,"" he said. ""And that would be a very small lifestyle change that can affect disease risk a long time down the line.""

Raji and his colleagues are slated to discuss their findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, an incurable, age-related disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking and language skills. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment have less severe memory loss than those with Alzheimer's but often go on to develop the disease.

To assess the impact of fish on cognitive health, the authors focused on 260 mentally healthy elderly individuals drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study, sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

All the participants underwent 3-D MRIs, so the researchers could map out the size of each individual's gray matter and track it over 10 years. They also completed the U.S. National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaire.

The team then stacked up gray matter changes against dietary consumption as reported in the questionnaire.

The questionnaires revealed that 163 of the study participants ate fish at least once a week, with most consuming fish between one and four times a week.

With that information, the authors found that regardless of age, gender, physical activity routines, and/or educational achievement, race or weight, those who ate baked or broiled fish had larger mass in the hippocampus, precuneus, posterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex regions of their brains.

The team further observed that people who ate baked or broiled fish weekly displayed better so-called ""working memory,"" enabling them to more effectively execute routine tasks.

But fish and chips lovers, take note: No cranial benefit was evident with respect to consumption of fried fish.

The team cautioned that while eating baked and broiled fish appears to exert some cognitive benefit, other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors may play a role. For now, the connection must be viewed as an association, rather than a cause-and-effect.

Dr. Richard Lipton, vice chair of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, reiterated the point.

""One has to wonder if there are other factors associated with fish consumption that they didn't measure that might be protective,"" he said. ""Like maybe people who eat fish exercise more, or eat less total calories. Or they could be eating other components of a Mediterranean Diet, such as fruits and vegetables.""

Lipton added that ""this group of researchers is really, really good,"" and called the study results ""a very interesting finding, and absolutely worthy of further exploration.""

Research presented at scientific meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

In a new study, imaging scans showed that regular fish-eaters were less likely to have brain cells die off in the area of the brain responsible for short-term memory -- recalling a phone number that was just heard, for example.

And people who ate baked or broiled fish at least weekly and didn't lose brain cells were much less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease or mild mental impairment, says Cyrus Raji, MD, PhD, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

Several studies have linked a diet rich in certain fish to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. This benefit is thought to come from the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, although studies of fish oil supplements have produced disappointing results in people who already have Alzheimer's.

""The new study is the first to establish a direct relationship between fish consumption, brain structure, and Alzheimer's risk,"" Raji says.

story_reviews_00966,"Nov. 28, 2011 (Chicago) -- Researchers are using high-energy waves similar to those used to make microwave popcorn to destroy inoperable lung tumors.

In a preliminary study, the technique, called microwave ablation, eliminated lung tumors in 19 of 28 patients. Eight months later, none of the tumors had come back.

Tumors shrank or stopped growing in the other nine patients, says study researcher Claudio Pusceddu, MD, a specialist in radiation and oncology at Oncological Hospital in Cagliari, Italy.

During microwave ablation, radiologists place a thin microwave antenna directly into the tumor. An electromagnetic wave then agitates water molecules in the surrounding tumor tissue, producing friction and heat that eventually destroy the tumor.

The procedure, which costs about $2,000, takes about an hour, and the patient is typically kept overnight in the hospital for observation.

U.S. researchers say the technique certainly shows promise. But more patients have to be followed for far longer to see if they stay in remission, they say.

story_reviews_00967,"We rarely stop to think about it, but reading is an amazing accomplishment. It turns markings on a page or a screen into coherent thoughts. It’s a complicated process: The eyes see a procession of letters, and the brain turns them into words.

The reading process is challenging for people with dyslexia. The disorder isn’t well understood, but there seems to be a communication breakdown between the eyes and the brain. Some people with dyslexia have trouble associating letters with sounds and words. Others say that words and letters look blurry, distorted or jumbled.

ChromaGen Vision says it can help restore order to the written word. The company offers glasses and contact lenses with a special tint that supposedly help people with dyslexia read faster and more accurately.

Visitors to the ChromaGen website are asked to complete a seven-question survey to see if the lenses may be right for them. If they answer yes to questions like “Do you notice that words or sentences are blurry or wiggly during reading?” they are encouraged to make an appointment with a certified practitioner, usually an optometrist. A list of providers is on the website.

The lenses come in 16 shades, all of which look neutral gray when viewed on someone’s face. Practitioners mix and match them to come up with the pair of lenses that works best for each client. Prices vary, but a set of glasses, complete with the exam, typically costs a bit less than $1,000. A fitting for a pair of contact lenses costs about $500, but you would have to replace them every six months.

The claims

According to the company website, ChromaGen essentially works by slowing down the visual processing of letters and words, giving the language center of the brain time to catch up. A video includes testimonials from children who say the lenses stopped words from jumping or wiggling around on the page.

The website claims the lenses can help about 50% of people with dyslexia, but ChromaGen Chief Executive Ted Edwards in Kennett Square, Pa., says the true rate is probably much higher. “It’s a life-changing aid,” he says.

Advertisement

Michael Politzer, an optometrist in Brentwood, Tenn., who has prescribed about a half-dozen pairs of ChromaGen lenses, says that he’s seen “great results with properly screened patients.” He notes that there are different types of dyslexia, and only people who have trouble with visual distortions while reading are likely to benefit.

The bottom line

Dyslexia is a complex and controversial condition. Edwards says he’s well aware that many experts consider dyslexia a problem of language processing, not of vision, and that they tend to scoff at the notion that tinted lenses could help dyslexic people read.

And indeed, that’s the stance taken by Dr. Sheryl Handler, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Encino. “Dyslexia is not a visually based disorder,” says Handler, who led a 2011 report on dyslexia in the journal Pediatrics. “There is definitely no evidence that the lenses will improve dyslexia.”

That view is shared by Deborah Giaschi, a professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who has conducted MRI studies of the brains of people with dyslexia. “There’s really no scientific basis” for ChromaGen lenses, she says. In her opinion, the claim that the lenses slow down visual processing doesn’t make sense. Even if the lenses had that effect, she doesn’t see how that would help anyone read.

“Parents are desperate to help their kids, and this company is taking their money,” Giaschi says.

A search of the medical literature found a single, company-funded study suggesting that ChromaGen lenses could improve the reading skills of people with dyslexia. The study of 47 dyslexics, led by optician and lens inventor David Harris, found that ChromaGen lenses worked significantly better than placebo lenses.

Giaschi says the study is unconvincing and the results have never been confirmed by other researchers. She adds that the lack of follow-up studies in the last decades is a clear sign that dyslexia researchers don’t take the approach seriously.

Advertisement

Chris Chase, a professor of optometry at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, who has investigated the role of visual disturbances in dyslexia, agrees that the current scientific evidence for ChromaGen lenses is slim. But he said that if a person has trouble focusing on words and letters, tinted lenses could potentially help eyes work together to clear up the picture. In such cases, ChromaGen “could be worth a try,” he says.

But Giaschi has a different suggestion. “It would make more sense to spend your money on something that’s proven to help. Like a tutor.”

story_reviews_00968,"Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. “With the natural dawn being later in winter, the body rhythms drift late,” Dr. Lewy said. “If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”

Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. And because it has few side effects, researchers are studying whether light therapy can help with depression during pregnancy and be used to treat elderly people with dementia. It is also being investigated for the treatment of bulimia nervosa, severe premenstrual syndrome and even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.

Though randomized controlled clinical trials of bright light are difficult to do properly — one expert is fond of saying that it is difficult to “blind” studies of bright light — the American Psychiatric Association considers bright-light therapy an effective low-risk treatment for both S.A.D. and nonseasonal major depressive disorder.

A 2006 multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared bright-light therapy head to head with the popular antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) in 96 subjects found the two treatments equally effective for alleviating winter depression, though light produced results faster, usually within a week, and with fewer side effects.

Why, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. Moreover, “doctors are just more comfortable prescribing medication, because that’s what they do for everything,” Dr. Lewy said.

Some patients who suffer from chronic depression say they use light therapy in addition to their regular medication in the winter months.

“I’ve always seen a drastic change in my personality from spring and summer to fall and winter, and it got worse as I got older,” said Rick Bach, 54, a painter who owns a hair salon in West Hartford, Conn., and tries to spend every January in Puerto Rico.

But while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him. “It can help you from falling into a deep depression, but it won’t help you climb out of one,” he said.

No one knows exactly how light treatment works, but most experts seem to agree that the body has a master biological clock that responds to or is “set” by natural light fluctuations.

“Light does more than just enable us to see,” said Dr. Norman Rosenthal, author of the landmark book “Winter Blues,” who was among the first to identify and describe S.A.D. Light also has an effect on hormones, the body’s chemical messengers, affecting the brain’s hypothalamus, which is involved in regulating mood, energy and appetite.

“The hormone melatonin, which is secreted at night, can be suppressed by light,” Dr. Rosenthal said. “Studies have also shown that light influences serotonin and epinephrine pathways in the brain, the same neurotransmitter systems known to be affected in people with general depression.”

But while part of the appeal of light therapy is that it can be self-prescribed, using a light box is not as simple as it may appear. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.

Some patients may want to try simply getting more natural light to help with seasonal mood changes — getting out as much as possible during the brightest time of day in the winter, sitting near windows during the day or taking vacations to sunny locales in the winter.

If you choose to try light therapy, here are a few tips from experts.

COSTS Light boxes can be purchased for about $200 online; they are also available for rent. Some patients manage to get insurance reimbursement by having a doctor write a letter, but don’t count on your policy covering it.

PRECAUTIONS Side effects include headaches and hypomania, though experts say these are rare. Face the light but do not stare at the light. If you have an eye condition of any kind, clear light therapy with your ophthalmologist first.

TUESDAY, Nov. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An apple a day won't necessarily keep the doctor away, but three kiwis just might help, at least according to a small study that showed that the brown, fuzzy fruit may lower blood pressure levels.

Men and women with mildly high blood pressure who ate three kiwi fruits a day for eight weeks had systolic blood pressure levels that were 3.6 millimeters of mercury lower than those of volunteers who ate an apple a day. Systolic blood pressure is the upper number in a blood pressure measurement.

Kiwis may be small, but they pack a lot of nutrition in their green flesh. They are rich in lutein, a potent antioxidant, and this may be what is responsible for their blood pressure-lowering powers, said researchers who were led by Mette Svendsen of Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.

Cardiologists were quick to caution that there is no single magic food or ingredient that is the key to heart health, but they all agreed that kiwi may have a place in the five daily servings of fruit and vegetables that are currently recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet.

The new study included 50 men and 68 women with an average age of 55 who were randomly assigned to eat three kiwis or one apple a day for eight weeks. Participants had blood pressure levels in the mildly elevated range of 128/85 when the study began. A blood pressure reading that is less than 120/80 is considered ideal. They changed nothing in their diet other than adding the fruit. Researchers measured blood pressure via 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, which is thought to be more precise than measuring it during a single point in time.

The Oslo University Hospital funded the study.

""Three kiwi a day improved 24-hour blood pressure more than an apple a day,"" the researchers concluded.

So, is kiwi the new ""wonder"" fruit?

""There is biological plausibility, but I would not go and grab three kiwis a day,"" said Dr. Nehal Mehta, a preventive cardiologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ""They are not easy to find or one of those fruits that people readily grab.""

Moderation is the key with kiwis or any food, he said. ""Three kiwis a day or 21 kiwis a week does not seem like moderation, and I would caution against eating that much,"" he said.

The new study may just ""put kiwis on the map,"" he said. ""When we say 'eat more fresh fruit,' we stick to the tried-and-true or anything that is handheld and peeled, but these findings suggest that a kiwi can be part of a heart-healthy diet,"" he said.

In addition, the study looked at the whole fruit, not individual nutrients. Don't start popping lutein in supplement form based on these results, he noted.

Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. ""Kiwi is not the wonder fruit, but certainly adding kiwi to your diet can help decrease mildly high blood pressure levels.""

Dr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that while promising, the new study is small. ""Don't count on this to be the complete answer to high blood pressure,"" he said. Whatever you do, ""do not stop taking your blood pressure medications without talking to your doctor,"" he added.

Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

It's early -- results are in for only the first 16 patients -- but the results already are drawing praise from experts not easily impressed by first reports.

""This is a groundbreaking study of extreme importance,"" Joshua Hare, MD, director of the University of Miami's Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute, tells WebMD via email. Hare was not involved in the study.

""The reported benefits are of an unexpected magnitude,"" writes Gerd Heusch, MD, PhD, chair of the Institute of Pathophysiology at the University of Essen, Germany, in an editorial in the Nov. 14 online issue of The Lancet.

Study researcher John H. Loughran, MD, of the University of Louisville, Ky., could barely contain his excitement in an interview with WebMD.

He says he plays basketball with his granddaughter, works on his farm, and gets on the treadmill for 30 minutes three times a week. It is stories like that that makes these results really encouraging.""

The breakthrough comes just as researchers were becoming discouraged by studies in which bone-marrow stem cells failed to heal damaged hearts.

Instead of getting stem cells from the bone marrow, the new technique harvests stem cells taken from the patients' own hearts during bypass surgery. Just 1 gram of heart tissue -- about 3.5 hundredths of an ounce -- is taken.

Using a technique invented by Brigham & Women's Hospital researchers Piero Anversa, MD, and colleagues, heart stem cells are taken from the tissue and grown in the lab. These adult stem cells already are committed to becoming heart cells, but they can transform into any of the three different kinds of heart tissues.

MONDAY, Nov. 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary research suggests that a single injection of a man-made protein might lower levels of ""bad"" cholesterol.

Given in the abdomen, AMG145 reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels among a group of healthy volunteers. The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver's ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.

The findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.

High cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone's numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.

Study author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can't tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.

""Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,"" he said.

The study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. Researchers measured LDL cholesterol levels for 85 to 113 days after treatment.

The new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. There were also decreases seen in levels of total cholesterol and apo-B (tiny fat particles in the blood that also increase the risk for heart disease). Levels of triglycerides and ""good"" HDL cholesterol were not altered by the medication, and there were no serious side effects reported. Now, researchers are testing the new shot in people who have high cholesterol.

Cardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy.

Former AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.

""Even though statins are so effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke, they do need to be taken every day and they can have certain side effects in some people,"" said Sacco, who is also chairman of neurology at the University of Miami. Statin side effects can include liver damage and/or muscle pain.

""This new shot may provide a more long-lasting approach, especially if it could be given once a month,"" Sacco said.

Dr. Dan Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said that PCSK9 is ""the hottest target for new treatments to lower LDL cholesterol."" And these study results will probably fuel that fire, he added.

""A 60-plus percent reduction in LDL with a single dose of this antibody is impressive,"" he said. ""It is the early days, but the data look strong. We now need more data with people who have repeated dosing and are followed for longer periods of time,"" Rader added.

""There are still plenty of people who can't achieve adequate LDL levels with existing drugs, including statins,"" he noted. Plus, ""people may find it easier to get a shot every two weeks or monthly than to take a pill every day.""

Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

story_reviews_00972,"A new scan to help in difficult-to-diagnose cases of Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes is available at more than 80 U.S. hospitals, including some in the Chicago area, since receiving federal approval earlier this year.



During the DaTscan test, an imaging drug is injected into a patient's bloodstream and the patient undergoes a single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT, scan. Patients with Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes have scans that show low levels of dopamine, the neurotransmitter critical in controlling movement and other muscle functions.



In cases where a diagnosis isn't necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered.



""DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient's response to medications,"" Rezak said. ""The earlier we get treatment started, the better. Before DaTscan we would watch and wait because there were no other objective tests to use. Now we can get a diagnosis sooner.""



The DaTscan injection was first used in Europe a decade ago, and GE Healthcare made it available to U.S. hospitals in late June. It is the first ""radiopharmaceutical adjunct imaging agent"" approved by the Food and Drug Administration that helps physicians better evaluate patients who are thought to have Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes.



Approval of DaTscan followed two Phase 3 clinical trials in which 284 adult patients with tremors were studied. During an FDA advisory panel meeting, committee members were mostly positive about DaTscan, though one neurologist objected to the average $1,500 cost of a scan versus $150 for a month's supply of carbidopa or levodopa medications for a Parkinson's patient, according to Medscape Medical News.



""I was thrilled there was something that could positively tell me I had Parkinson's because everybody had guessed what I had,"" said Ray Ramas, 56, who in June became the first patient at Central DuPage to undergo the scan.



Before the test, Ramas, of West Chicago, experienced two years of uncertainty about his health as several specialists tried to pinpoint the cause of his joint and tendon pain, fatigue, stiffness in his legs and lack of bladder control. Eventually he developed a tremor in his right arm.



His doctor said he might have fibromyalgia and sent him to a rheumatologist. Another specialist said his symptoms suggested parkinsonian syndrome, caused by various neurodegenerative disorders that share some features of Parkinson's. ""Another doctor ... wanted me to see a psychiatrist because he thought my symptoms were all in my head,"" Ramas recalled.



By March, Ramas could hardly walk. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan.



""I lay on a table, got an injection and the procedure took about 20 minutes. It was like getting my blood drawn,"" he said. In two days, Ramas found out he had Parkinson's disease.



""Many patients are gratified to know what they're dealing with. It allows them to accept treatment earlier,"" Rezak said. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.



Northwestern Memorial Hospital has used DaTscan since October 2010 as part of a multicenter trial study, said Dr. William Spies, associate director of nuclear medicine at Northwestern.



As part of the study, recently diagnosed Parkinson's patients and healthy subjects are tested with DaTscan, and clinical and behavioral assessments are done to identify biomarkers of Parkinson's disease progression.



DaTscan was first used at the University of Chicago Medical Center in August on a 75-year-old male patient who exhibited essential tremors, parkinsonian syndrome and some rigidity and slowness, said Dr. Tao Xie, assistant professor of neurology at the Medical Center's Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders.



""In the past, we would have had to wait to diagnose Parkinson's or chosen different medications to test, which might have had different side effects, and this would have delayed the timely diagnosis of Parkinson's,"" Xie said.",New scan can speed Parkinson's diagnosis,2,Chicago Tribune

story_reviews_00974,"MONDAY, Nov. 7, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An investigational drug called pridopidine seems an effective and safe treatment for people with the progressive movement disorder Huntington's disease, researchers report.

Huntington's patients have an imbalance in the signaling chemical dopamine. The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.

According to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington's is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.

The results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.

The study included 437 Huntington's disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.

After six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.

More than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.

""Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits. Its lack of severe side-effects . . . suggests that pridopidine might be useful even for those patients who are treated at sites that are not centers of excellence for Huntington's disease,"" the researchers concluded.

One U.S. neurologist agreed that the drug seems promising against a disease with few treatment options.

""There has been a great deal of attention for this drug, as it is one of the few molecules that in preliminary studies was found to have some efficacy in Huntington's disease,"" said Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, professor in the department of neurology and chief of the division of movement disorders at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.

""However, this is the first large study to show evidence of a positive result in treating the motor symptoms of this devastating disease. And, though the compound is apparently well tolerated without significant side effects, the benefit is modest and limited to the motor symptoms of the disease and it is unknown how long the improvement observed could last,"" he added.

Still, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said.

""Unfortunately, Huntington's is a progressive disease and this drug is not a treatment of the disease itself but only improves some of its symptoms,"" he explained. ""Nevertheless, it is a welcome addition because there is very little else yet available to treat the symptoms. The challenge for scientists and clinicians is to discover therapies that actually slows or halts the progression of the disease.""

Another expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed.

""A well-tolerated drug that produces even small benefits for patients with Huntington's disease would be a very welcome addition to the currently available treatments for this debilitating disorder,"" Andrew Feigin, from The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York City, wrote in an accompanying commentary.

The study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.

story_reviews_00975,"A new pill may help in the fight with cystic fibrosis.

A study, funded in part by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, found the drug ivacaftor (pronounced eye va kaf tor) caused patients with a specific type of cystic fibrosis to improve lung function, gain weight, and fight other aspects of the disease.

“This is the first time that we have a therapy that is directed at the cause of cystic fibrosis,” says Dr. Michael Konstan, the chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland and one of the authors of the study. There is no cure for this disease and existing treatments just help alleviate some of the symptoms.

“This is a big deal,” says Robert Beall, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. “The fact is it is obviously going to make a very big difference in the lives of patients.”

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes problems with the balance of salt going in and out of cells. A sticky mucus clogs organs, particularly the lungs and liver. It can also cause digestive problems. About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40.

Ivacaftor works for people with the G551D mutation of cystic fibrosis. Konstan says that only about 4% of the people with the disease have this specific mutation. “It really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,” he says. “Even thought it only affects a small percentage (of patients) the hope is there that we can finally do something about this disease.”

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, looked at 84 people who got the drug. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. Drug recipients could blow out more than 10% more air from their lungs compared with patients who were not taking the drug, and were about half as likely to have a “pulmonary exacerbation” or a worsening of their lung disease that often requires hospitalization. On average, patients taking the drug grew more and put on more weight than the placebo group, according to the study, and had lower sweat chloride – an indicator of the disease.

Beall says the improved lung function helped patients double their ability to walk and one patient even started going the gym for the first time.

“We have an incredible proof of concept,” Beall says. He points to other research under way with ivacaftor combined with another drug that could help people with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis. That trial is ongoing and the treatment is at least four or five years away from approval, but if it works, Beall says, it could help 90% of the people with cystic fibrosis.

In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Pamela Davis, of Case Western University paraphrased Winston Churchill, “This study is also a great victory in the war against genetic diseases and marks the end of the beginning for the treatment of the cystic fibrosis defect.”

Ivacaftor has been submitted to the FDA for approval, and could be available next year, according to Konstan. When it goes on sale it will be sold under the brand name Kalydeco (pronounced kuh-LYE-deh-koh).",New drug 'big deal' in cystic fibrosis fight,2,CNN
story_reviews_00976,"Dermatologists will soon get some high-tech help deciding which suspicious-looking moles should be removed and checked for melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.

The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a first-of-its-kind device, called MelaFind, that makes detailed, digital images of skin growths and uses a computer to analyze them for signs of cancer, offering a sort of second opinion to doctors. The device is approved only for dermatologists and only for use on growths that don't have obvious signs of cancer but still have one or two worrisome traits.

The hope is to find more melanomas sooner. Nearly all patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma can be treated and cured, but 85 percent of patients with late-stage melanoma die from it within five years.

More than 70,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with melanoma this year, and 16 percent are diagnosed only after the disease has spread to other parts of the body, according to estimates from the National Institutes of Health.

To diagnose the disease, doctors decide which moles to remove and biopsy using an entirely visual set of guidelines involving size, shape and color. Most dermatologists easily spot late-stage lesions that have obvious signs of cancer, including irregular edges, uneven color and a width greater than 6 millimeters. But many others are tough calls.

""Every day patients come in with 20 moles on their back and the dilemma is, which ones are suspicious and need to be biopsied?"" said Dr. David Pariser, former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. ""The diagnosis of melanoma is the most serious one a dermatologist makes, and we have sleepless nights worrying about it,"" said Pariser, who consulted for the device's maker, Mela Sciences Inc. of Irvington, N.Y., on its presentation to FDA.

The device's handheld attachment, about the size of a blow dryer, emits light that penetrates below the surface of the skin, taking multicolored images that reflect the depth and shape of skin growths. A computer compares these to a database of 10,000 archived images and recommends whether a biopsy should be done.

In a company-sponsored study published last year involving around 1,300 patients, some with multiple growths, doctors reported that MelaFind correctly suggested biopsies on 125 of 127 melanomas that doctors had removed. MelaFind correctly identified about 10 percent of non-cancerous growths, which was better than doctors in the study who were correct less than 4 percent of the time, on average. The study was published in the Archives of Dermatology.

The company's study was not intended to show that screening with the device saves lives, only that it can help improve a doctor's ability to spot melanoma.

For now, experts say MelaFind will help dermatologists make better decisions on which moles to remove.

""There is no such thing as 100 percent certainty in medicine,"" said Dr. George Elias, a melanoma expert at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center who had no ties to the company or the device.

""Ultimately it's the responsibility of the dermatologist to use his clinical judgment to make the best decision. This machine is there to help him, not replace him.""

Elias voted with the majority of an FDA panel that narrowly endorsed the device last year.

Dermatologists say it's too early to tell whether MelaFind will lead to fewer unnecessary biopsies.

""A biopsy takes a few minutes in my hands, so if there's an issue with any lesion we will always biopsy, whether we have a MelaFind picture or not,"" said Dr. Leonard Goldberg, a dermatologist at the Texas Medical Center and vice president of the Skin Cancer Foundation, a disease awareness group that accepts donations from makers of sunscreen.

MelaFind underwent a contentious, years-long review by the Food and Drug Administration, which initially rejected the device and concluded it could ""potentially cause more harm than good.""

Regulators worried that the device could give physicians a false sense of certainty, leading to fewer biopsies. Another concern was that doctors could misinterpret the device's feedback, particularly error messages when a mole cannot be scanned. About 8 percent of growths scanned in the company study came back as ""unevaluable.""

At a meeting last fall, FDA scientists said Mela Sciences had not shown how its device would influence day-to-day decisions by doctors. The agency also worried about its use by general doctors not accustomed to identifying suspicious skin moles. Despite these concerns, the panel of advisers narrowly backed the overall safety and efficacy of the device in a 8-7 vote.

Regulators said this week that they ultimately approved the device after Mela Sciences agreed to limit its use to board-certified dermatologists who undergo a specialized training course.

""The device is only good for certain lesions, and that's why you have to be a dermatologist to be able to classify and categorize those lesions appropriately,"" said Christy Foreman, director of FDA's Office of Device Evaluation.

Foreman said an FDA-required follow-up study would help determine how much of a benefit MelaFind represents for patients.

""This device represents new technology. At the end of the day I don't know that this will be the best technology out there, but it is a step forward to allow continued innovation in this area,"" Foreman said.

Don't expect to see a MelaFind machine at your next doctor's appointment. The company plans to bring them next year to just 200 dermatologists on the East coast, all of whom must undergo company training before they can begin using the device.

Doctors will pay a one-time fee of $7,500 to lease and receive training on the device. Patients will pay $150 out of pocket for a MelaFind scan, which analysts say may limit use to more affluent patients who are willing to pay extra for the latest medical care. Mela Sciences does not plan to ask insurers to cover the device until several years from now, after it is more widely used.",New Device Uses Light to Screen for Melanoma,5,Associated Press
story_reviews_00977,"A large, new study may be reassuring to women considering mastectomies because of a history of breast cancer in their families.

Stanford University researchers affirmed that women with mothers and sisters who carry one of the BRCA gene mutations but who aren't carriers themselves don't have an especially heightened risk of breast cancer.

The findings run counter to an influential 2007 study, which found that such women could have as much as a five-fold higher risk of developing the disease as the general population, even if they tested negative for the two genetic mutations known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.

That report raised concerns among doctors and patients alike that a negative BRCA test didn't necessarily mean women had escaped the risk associated with the mutations, which significantly raise a woman's risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Some women who test positive opt for prophylactic surgery to remove their breasts or ovaries.

""Women who test negative for BRCA don't require excessive interventions just because BRCA is in the family,"" said Allison Kurian, an assistant professor of both medicine and health research and policy at Stanford and lead author of the study.

The findings, published online Monday by the Journal of Clinical Oncology, are based on an analysis of 3,047 families, including 292 with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, enrolled in a breast-cancer family registry. Researchers said it was the largest study yet undertaken to assess breast-cancer risk among non-carriers of inheritable mutations.

The results support current guidelines that say non-BRCA mutation carriers in families affected by the BRCA genes don't need special screening beyond mammography as recommended for the general population, and needn't consider preventive surgery.

The BRCA mutations are associated with a five-fold risk of getting breast cancer and a 20-fold risk of ovarian cancer compared with people without the mutations, according to the National Cancer Institute. The chance that women who inherent the genes will get breast cancer during their lives is 45% to 65%; the likelihood is 11% to 40% for ovarian cancer.

The heightened risk has prompted women whose mothers or sisters were diagnosed with BRCA-positive tumors to get tested themselves, with the assumption that a negative test meant their chances of developing the cancers was low.

That's why the 2007 study was so troubling. It ""cast doubt on the whole meaning of a negative test result,"" Dr. Kurian said. ""We all see genetic tests as giving relatives an out when it's negative.""

Dr. Kurian said the earlier study had methodological flaws that may have led to an overestimate of risk for non-BRCA carriers.

Several other published studies have subsequently contradicted the 2007 findings. Monday's study, though, is special because it is population-based, not based on patients going to a clinic. Therefore it has a broader representation of mutation-carrying families, said Mark Robson, clinic director of the clinical genetics service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Dr. Robson, who wasn't an involved in the study but his team did a study that also contradicted the 2007 research, wrote an editorial accompanying it.

Eric Winer, chief of the division of women's cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston who wasn't involved in the current research, said the study shows that for women in families with an inherited breast-cancer gene but who don't inherit it, the risk of developing cancer does not appear to be significantly increased. They may still face a slightly elevated risk because they have a family member with the disease.

story_reviews_00978,"TUESDAY, Nov. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Multiple sclerosis patients may eventually benefit from a novel treatment that takes aim at the abnormal behavior of a specific type of immune cell, preliminary research suggests.

The errant behavior of the cells in question -- known as ""B cells"" -- is viewed as key to the development of this chronic and disabling nervous system disease, commonly called MS.

The new therapy's potential is only in the early stages of exploration, cautions an international study team comprised of researchers from the United States, Canada, Switzerland and the Netherlands, in the report published in the Nov. 1 online edition of The Lancet.

But initial indications suggest that the new antibody drug, called ocrelizumab, successfully targets these renegade cells with hopeful results: a significant reduction in disease-related inflammatory brain lesions.

""Our findings show that ocrelizumab rapidly suppresses inflammatory activity,"" noted the study authors, led by Dr. Ludwig Kappos from the University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, in a journal news release.

Describing the targeting of B cells as an ""innovative therapeutic approach,"" Kappos and his colleagues reported that in testing among 218 patients, the drug's impact on lesions was ""rapid and pronounced."" What's more, to date the treatment appears to be safe.

The study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual's central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function.

A classic characteristic of the disease is inflammation, which takes the form of brain lesions.

The immune system's T cells have long been implicated in disease progression, but the notion that B cells may also play a major role is relatively new.

With this new potential target in mind, researchers configured ocrelizumab to specifically focus on a protein (CD20) found on the surface of certain B cells.

To test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries.

The patients were divided into four groups, treated with: a low dose of ocrelizumab (600 milligrams); a high dose of ocrelizumab (2,000 mg); a well-known MS inflammation treatment known as ""intramuscular interferon beta-1a""; or a sugar pill (placebo). After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.

The result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.

The number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What's more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.

The investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.

That said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.

""In fact, there's nothing novel about this at all,"" he said. ""There is another drug, called rituximab, that's been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It's not better or worse. It's the same,"" Rodriguez noted.

""So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,"" cautioned Rodriguez. ""It's not.""

MONDAY, Oct. 31, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors who listen to Mozart while performing colonoscopies may spot more precancerous growths, researchers suggest.

Better detection of these so-called adenomatous polyps could save lives, the study authors noted, as survival rates for colorectal cancer are better than 90 percent if the disease is detected early.

Previous research has shown that Mozart's music can provide a significant short-term boost to spatial-temporal reasoning, which involves a person's ability to compare and transform mental images in space and time. Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the ""Mozart Effect,"" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.

In their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (""baseline"") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.

Detection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.

However, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.

""Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,"" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.

The study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release. When spotted early, potentially dangerous polyps can be removed during colonoscopies, preventing the development of disease.

""Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy,"" said O'Shea. ""Anything we can do to get those rates up has the potential to save lives. While this is a small study, the results highlight how thinking outside the box -- in this case using Mozart -- to improve adenoma detection rates can potentially prove valuable to physicians and patients.""

The study was slated for presentation Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00980,"You wouldn’t last very long without oxygen. But just as rust slowly eats away at a nail, oxygen can age your body. As your cells use this vital element, they produce free radicals — unstable molecules that can damage your tissues and add wear and tear to your entire body, including your skin.

Many anti-aging products promise younger-looking skin through the power of antioxidants, compounds that help neutralize free radicals before they can do any harm. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C and beta carotene show up in a lot of sunscreens and lotions. But if you want your antioxidants to go more than skin deep, you might be interested in oral supplements.

Proleva, a supplement from Allmera Nutraceuticals, contains antioxidants from several different sources, including green tea, acai berries, goji berries and resveratrol, a compound found in grape skins. Users are instructed to take two capsules once a day. You can buy a bottle of 60 capsules on the company website for about $60.

Vivida, a supplement from Lifes2Good Inc., contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant that’s extracted from algae, along with vitamin C. Other ingredients include silica, from the horsetail plant, and a “marine extract” from cod and other ocean fish. Users are instructed to take one tablet in the morning and one in the evening. A bottle of 60 tablets costs about $50.

The claims

According to the company website, Proleva is a “fountain of youth” that can give users “youthful, glowing skin.” The site adds that “healthy vibrant skin comes not from a cream but from within.” (The site also says that the supplement will improve memory, enhance the immune system and speed healing, but those are claims for another time.)

Ron Slavick, the managing director of Allmera Nutraceuticals, says many Proleva customers boast of their softer, younger-looking skin. “You can’t treat skin with lotions and potions,” he says. “Healthy skin is a reflection of the health of the body.” He believes that the natural plant extracts in Proleva work better than the artificially produced antioxidants found in most multivitamins.

The website for Vivida says that the product “nourishes skin from the inside” to make it “smoother, firmer, and healthier.” Lifes2Good President Mark Holland says that antioxidants help “take impurities away from the skin” while softening fine lines and wrinkles. According to Holland, the antioxidants work together with the marine extract to keep the skin moist and supple.

The bottom line

Over the years, scientists have largely dashed the hopes that antioxidants could be the secret to good health and longer lives. Studies have failed to show that antioxidant supplements such as vitamin E and beta carotene can prevent heart disease, cancer or other major diseases. There’s still some hope that antioxidants can help the skin, but the results likely aren’t as dramatic as the companies suggest, says Dr. Patricia Farris, a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology who has a cosmetic dermatology practice in Metarie, La.

“These products are over-hyped,” Farris says. “Only a few studies show that you can improve the appearance of skin with any type of supplement.”

According to Farris, some but not all studies suggest that antioxidants can help protect the skin from sun damage, one of the major causes of wrinkles. But she notes that this would only prevent signs of aging, not fix any problems that a person already has. “I tell patients that antioxidants might help protect the skin, but they won’t repair the skin,” she says.

Proponents of antioxidants can point to a few studies with encouraging results. For example, a German study of 36 adults published in 2006 in the journal Skin Pharmacology and Physiology found that volunteers taking supplements containing the antioxidants lutein, selenium and lycopene (among other things) had measurably smoother skin after 12 weeks. There were no such benefits for the subjects taking a placebo. The changes were assessed with a scanning device, and it’s unclear if any benefits were visible to the naked eye.

In an unpublished, company-funded study provided by Holland, 83 women who took Vivida reported generally positive results. After 12 weeks, 74% said that their skin looked smoother and softer. These results weren’t confirmed by a dermatologist or anyone else, and there was no control group for comparison.

Plant-based nutrients deserve more study, but the field is still in its infancy, says Dr. David McDaniel, an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School who runs a cosmetic dermatology clinic in Virginia Beach. Because products vary widely in their ingredients and their doses, he can’t recommend any particular product without evidence to back it up.

“Without well-designed, statistically valid trials, I’m a skeptic,” he says.

WEDNESDAY, Oct. 26, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental psoriasis treatment performed significantly better than the commonly prescribed medication methotrexate in a new clinical trial.

The drug briakinumab reduced psoriasis symptoms by at least 75 percent in nearly 82 percent of those taking it, compared to just 40 percent of those on methotrexate. But serious side effects were more common among the briakinumab users.

""Very high levels of response"" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany.

Results of the study are published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories.

Psoriasis affects about 5 million Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.

The current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.

Nearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.

After six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.

After a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.

Briakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.

More serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent). There were also two cases of cancer in people taking briakinumab and none in the methotrexate group. However, the researchers said these differences weren't statistically significant.

""Cancer risk is extremely hard to define, and this study was not powered to detect any difference in the risk of developing a malignancy,"" said Bebo.

He said that in an earlier trial of briakinumab, some unexplained major adverse cardiac events occurred. At the time, Abbott withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pending further research. In the current study, no serious cardiovascular events were reported.

Of the increased infections and cancers, Reich said, ""Although these differences were not statistically significant, they lead to questions regarding a favorable risk-benefit profile of the drug.""

Research on briakinumab is continuing. An ongoing three-year trial involves 248 people from the current study.

For people living with psoriasis, Bebo said the message from this study is that ""dramatic progress has been made from where we were just five years ago.""

story_reviews_00982,"Oct. 26, 2011 -- An experimental drug called briakinumab appears to be more effective than a standard medication for treating psoriasis, a new study shows.

The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It included psoriasis patients who were assigned to get monthly injections of briakinumab or to take methotrexate pills weekly.

The result: The thick, red, flaking skin lesions that are characteristic of psoriasis cleared up in about three times as many patients who got briakinumab as those who got methotrexate.

""This drug has had, in this trial, the highest efficacy we have ever seen with any biologic in psoriasis before,"" says study researcher Kristian Reich, MD. Biologics are genetically engineered proteins derived from human genes.

Reich, a partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg and professor of dermatology, venerology, and allergology at Georg-August-University in Gottingen, Germany, says that after a year of therapy, roughly 60% of the 154 patients in the briakinumab group had near or complete clearance of their skin lesions. Those same results were achieved by about 10% to 20% of 163 patients in the methotrexate group.

""This is unheard of,"" Reich tells WebMD. ""We in dermatology have never spoken about remission before. But with this drug, the word 'remission' is on the table.""

But as successful as the drug appears to be for some patients, it may come with a significant risk. Patients taking briakinumab had more serious infections and more cancers than those taking methotrexate.

""We had amazing responses,"" Reich says. ""Obviously, the price that this comes with is the increased rate of serious infections and cancers.""

Abbott, the company that makes briakinumab, announced in January that it was withdrawing its bid to get the drug approved in the U.S. and Europe after regulators asked to see more robust proof that the medication was safe.

At that time, the company said it wanted to evaluate the ""next steps"" for briakinumab and might try for approval again at a later date.

""This is the single most effective drug we've had in psoriasis, ever,"" says Kenneth B. Gordon, MD, a dermatologist and clinical associate professor at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine. ""Many of us were disappointed it was withdrawn because there would be a subset of patients who wouldn't respond to anything else and it would have been nice to have for them.""

story_reviews_00983,"Weekly yoga classes relieve symptoms of low back pain about as well as intense, regular stretching sessions, a new study shows.

The research found that yoga and stretching were equally effective in easing chronic back pain and improving function, but participants had to practice each regularly to see benefits. The subjects in both groups took weekly 75-minute classes and practiced yoga or deep stretching at home for about 20 minutes at a time at least three days a week.

The study is the largest and most thorough to date to look at whether yoga has an effect on chronic low back pain, a problem that affects millions and has no surefire long-term remedy. A number of earlier studies suggested that regular yoga classes might benefit back pain sufferers, though most were limited by small sample sizes, short study periods and other flaws.

The latest study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine, involved more than 200 people who were followed for up to 26 weeks.

“This is good news for yoga,” said Karen J. Sherman, lead author of the study and senior scientific investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. “The smaller studies which hinted that yoga might be helpful all had problems one way or another. This is a much larger study, and the findings are robust.”

About four out of five people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, prompting Americans to spend $50 billion a year on medications, physical therapy and related costs. Exercise, and in particular strength-training routines that develop muscles of the trunk and core, can help reduce pain and improve function, though many people avoid them for fear of doing further harm.

To find out whether the movements and static poses associated with yoga could make a difference, as earlier research had suggested, Dr. Sherman and her colleagues recruited 228 people with chronic low back pain in the Seattle area. Their mean age was in the late 40s to 50, and they were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took weekly yoga classes over 12 weeks, which typically included breathing exercises, 5 to 11 postures and guided deep relaxation. Another group went to weekly stretching classes built around aerobic exercises, deep stretches and strengthening exercises focused on the trunk and leg muscles. Both groups were given handouts and instructional CDs and DVDs and asked to practice 20 minutes at home on days when there was no class. Those in the third group served as “self-care” controls and received a book containing advice on back exercises and ways to reduce pain.

After 12 weeks, those in the yoga group were, over all, significantly less bothered by symptoms than the control group, and they reported better function and less difficulty in mundane daily activities like walking up stairs and bending down to put on socks. The improvements remained when the researchers checked with them 26 weeks after the start of the study. Those in the stretching group saw just as much benefit as the people taking yoga. More than half of the subjects in each group improved on measurements of function by at least 50 percent, compared with less than a quarter of the controls.

“Compared with self-care, yoga and stretching class participants were significantly more likely to rate their back pain as better, much better or completely gone at all follow-up times,” the study noted. “More participants in the yoga and stretching groups were very satisfied with their overall care for back pain.”

Dr. Sherman said that like many other therapies for low back pain, yoga probably would not work for everyone. For those who want to try, a weekly class and a few 20-minute sessions at home might be a good starting point, she said.

“Does everybody need to practice at least 20 minutes a day three times a week? It probably depends on your back pain,” she said. “At a certain point in time you learn what your back needs.”

As an alternative to yoga, stretching may be a viable option. Dr. Sherman recommended taking an intensive stretching class, then establishing a routine at home. But she cautioned that her study looked specifically at deep stretching that is far more involved than the brief, light stretches most people do before or after a workout.

“It’s not like stretching each leg for 30 seconds,” she said. “It’s much more intensive. You might spend two minutes stretching each leg before moving on and stretching other parts of the body, so you’re really getting in there.”",Yoga and Stretching Equally Effective for Back Pain,3,Back pain
story_reviews_00984,"A study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but it didn't find any evidence that yoga provided broader mental benefits.

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, was published online Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine. It was lead by researchers at Seattle's Group Health Research Institute.

A study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but didn't find any evidence yoga provided broader mental benefits. Jennifer Corbett-Dooren explains on Lunch Break.

Smaller studies in the past have suggested that yoga, which involves stretching exercises along with a mental component of deep breathing and other relaxation techniques, was moderately effective at easing symptoms of chronic lower back pain.

It was thought the combination of stretching and relaxation relieved back pain, according to previous studies.

But the current study found both yoga and stretching were equally as effective, suggesting the benefits of yoga are attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental components, said the study's lead author, Karen J. Sherman, senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute.

It involved 228 adults with chronic, low back pain that didn't have a specific cause such as a spinal disc problem. They were divided into three groups to compare two types of classes with patients using a self-care book that provided instruction on exercises and stretches to help treat lower pain.

The people who took classes may have been more likely to complete the exercises. More than 80% of the participants in the self-care group reported reading some of the book and doing some exercises, but time spent on the exercises was typically less than the class groups. ""They need that class format to get started,"" Ms. Sherman said.

About 50% of patients in the yoga or stretching classes reported feeling much better or completely better in relation to their back pain and function compared to about 20% of patients in the self-care group, said Ms. Sherman.

Twice as many patients in the yoga and stretching groups reported decreased medication use during the study compared to the self-care group.

About 90 patients each were randomly assigned to attend 75-minute weekly yoga classes or weekly stretching classes for 12 weeks. The people who attended the classes were also instructed to practice for 20 minutes a day at home in between classes.

Another group involved 45 patients who were given a 200-page book with advice on exercising, lifestyle modifications and managing flare-ups.

The type of yoga used in the study was viniyoga, a style of hatha yoga, that adapts exercises for each person's physical condition. The stretching classes involved 15 stretches targeting the lower back and legs were which held for a full minute repeated for a total of 52 minutes of stretching.

The study measured changes in back pain and functional status at the beginning of the study and at six weeks, 12 weeks and six months.

""There certainly seems to be a benefit to using the laser,"" says American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) spokesman James Salz, MD, clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He reviewed the findings for WebMD.

Standard vs. Laser Cataract Surgery

More than 1.5 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. One in three mostly older Americans will have the surgery at some point in their lives.

The surgery is performed to remove the natural lens of the eye after it has become clouded over time. A permanent artificial lens is then implanted to replace the natural lens and provide appropriate vision correction for each patient.

Currently, most aspects of cataract surgery, including the initial incision and the breakup and removal of the clouded lens from the lens capsule, are performed manually by the surgeon. An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out.

The new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal.

""The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,"" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. ""Ideally, you won't need ultrasound, or at least you'll need less ultrasound.""

That's important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says. It can hinder recovery and cause clouding of the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye.

Although approved by the FDA, the femtosecond laser procedure is not widely used in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",Cataract Surgery May Be Safer With Laser,3,WebMD

SUNDAY, Oct. 23, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Older women who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- such as aspirin or ibuprofen -- appear to have a lower risk of death from colorectal cancer than women who don't use these medications, a large new study suggests.

Women who reported using these drugs, called NSAIDs, at the beginning of the study and three years later had a roughly 30 percent lower rate of death from colorectal cancer than women who did not take the drugs, or women who took them at only one of these two points in time, according to an American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) news release.

""Our results suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with lower colorectal cancer mortality among postmenopausal women who use these medications more consistently and for longer periods of time,"" Anna Coghill, a doctoral student in epidemiology at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said in the news release.

In the study, researchers examined the use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs among more than 160,000 postmenopausal women in relation to deaths from colorectal cancer.

Study participants were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, which ""represents a large and well-characterized cohort [group] of postmenopausal women, and the medication data collected in this cohort made it possible for us to investigate multiple types, durations and strengths of NSAID use,"" Coghill explained.

The researchers confirmed 2,119 cases of colorectal cancer and 492 deaths due to the disease.

""The results of our study help to further clarify the importance of different durations of NSAID use over time for the risk for dying from colorectal cancer,"" Coghill noted in the news release.

While the study found an association between NSAID use and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, it did not prove a cause-and-effect.

The findings were slated for presentation on Sunday at the AACR International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research, in Boston.

Experts say that for studies presented at medical meetings, data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

story_reviews_00989,"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction.

The medical device maker said it completed an initial feasibility study of 30 men, average age of 60, who suffered from erectile dysfunction (ED). After three months the results were promising, the company said.

The stent — a tiny wire mesh tube similar to those used to prop open heart arteries — was placed in the internal pudendal artery, which supplies blood to the penis.

The stent was delivered using a catheter threaded up to the pelvis, where the pudendal artery is located. It was placed in the artery, opening the vessel and allowing for better blood flow.

“ED is largely a vascular disease and that’s why Medtronic was interested in this,” said Dr. Jason Rogers of UC Davis Medical Center, one of the researchers of the company-sponsored trial.

There are an estimated 30 million men in the United States who have ED and 300 million worldwide.

Rogers said up to 50 percent of men discontinue drug therapy — which includes Viagra, Levitra and Cialis — either because it did not work or because they could not tolerate side effects, including lowering of blood pressure.

He also noted that men who take certain drugs for heart disease cannot use the popular pills.

“There’s a real unmet clinical need,” Rogers said.

Initial findings showed two-thirds of men who underwent the 1- to 2-hour procedure improved by at least 4 points on the 30-point Internal Index of Erectile Dysfunction scale, he said.

There were no adverse events reported up to three months later, but Rogers acknowledged that risks may become evident much later.

“This is still investigational and requires more research. It is the inception of an entirely new way of treating ED that has never been seen before,” he said.

Rogers said it could be several years before Medtronic undertakes a much larger late-stage trial.

MONDAY, Oct. 17 (HealthDay News) -- Women who undergo mammograms every two years instead of every year have fewer false-positive results, but the trade-off is a slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer, new research finds.

""After 10 years, biennial mammograms reduced the risk of false-positives by about one-third and, over a lifetime, that would accumulate,"" said Rebecca Hubbard, lead author of a study published in the Oct. 18 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine and funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute.

But the increase in breast cancer diagnoses wasn't statistically significant, she said. And breast cancer stage was only analyzed in women who actually developed cancer.

On the other hand, among roughly 170,000 women screened between 1994 and 2006 and followed for a decade, more than half who received annual mammograms were called back at least once because of a false-positive result, and 7 to 9 percent were recommended to get a biopsy.

Fewer women -- about 42 percent -- who had biennial screening were called back because of a false-positive, while 4.8 percent were referred for a biopsy.

Having a previous mammogram for comparison purposes sliced the rate of false-positives in half.

For the study, researchers used data from NCI's Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.

Women undergoing once-yearly mammograms need to be prepared for possible call backs, and being prepared may reduce the anxiety around such an event, the authors stated.

This is the latest volley in an ongoing debate about when to start mammography screening in women.

In 2009, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), a government-sponsored organization, startled the world by recommending that women start mammograms at age 50 instead of 40 and then only once every two years rather than once a year.

The move released an outcry in the medical community, leading to this and other studies to try to determine the best timing for mammograms, the only screening tool shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer.

The new study gives a nod in the direction of the UPSTF recommendations, but practitioners aren't necessarily ready to let go of the long-standing once-a-year recommendation.

Hubbard, an assistant investigator with Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, Wash., said she ""definitely wouldn't make a specific recommendation for individual women. I feel it's really an individual choice where a woman needs to think about her own risk tolerance and also their own breast cancer risk.""

""This gives women more information as to what the risks and benefits of mammography are,"" added Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""It's a personal choice as to whether or not you absolutely have to screen at 40. As breast surgeons, we're still going to advocate that mammograms start at 40.""

A second study in the same journal issue looked at more than 800,000 U.S. women screened from 2000 to 2006 and found that newer digital mammography and older film mammography were similarly accurate in finding cancer in women ages 50 through 79.

But in premenopausal women in their 40s, who tend to have denser breast tissue, digital mammography performed better. Again, though, the risk of false-positives was higher than with film mammography.

""There was a trade-off here as well,"" said Hubbard, who was also an author of this study. ""In general, in women aged 50 to 79 the two modalities performed pretty equivalently, but in younger women the sensitivity of digital mammography was a little bit better so it found more cancers, but there was also a bigger decrease in specificity [resulting in more false-positives].""

story_reviews_00992,"Researchers analyzed data from nearly 170,000 women who had their first screening mammogram at age 40 to 59 years and almost 4,500 women with invasive breast cancer . Information about the women and their mammograms came from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, funded by the National Cancer Institute.

The task force says the decision to start regular, biennial mammograms before age 50 should be an individual choice based on each patient's situation. Meanwhile, the American Cancer Society continues to recommend that women get mammograms every year beginning at age 40.

The frequency of screening mammograms -- and the appropriate age to begin them -- has been debated since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended that women routinely get screening mammograms every other year starting at age 50.

Oct. 17, 2011 -- Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a false alarm, a new study shows.

False-Positives Are Common

After 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram. And 7% to 9% will be told they should have a biopsy because of something suspicious that turns out not to be cancer, the researchers concluded.

Those false-positives may cause inconvenience and anxiety, and biopsies can cause pain and scarring, the researchers note.

They found a small but not significant increase in the chance that women diagnosed with breast cancer had a more advanced case if they underwent screening every other year instead of every year.

The study wasn't really designed to answer the question of which screening regimen is best, study researcher Rebecca Hubbard, PhD, says. Its main message, Hubbard says, is that call-backs (or recalls) for false-positive results are common, so women shouldn't panic when they occur.

""In most cases, a recall doesn't mean you have cancer,"" says Hubbard, a biostatistician at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. ""Hopefully, there will be less anxiety about getting a recall.""

Women can halve their risk of a call-back for a false-positive if the interpreting radiologist has previous mammograms for comparison, the researchers found.

story_reviews_00993,"Hair-transplant surgery could become cheaper and more accessible with a new robot that plucks hair follicles from the back and sides of the head so they can be moved to the top and front of a balding pate.

It normally takes eight to nine hours to individually harvest, by hand, the 1,000 follicle clusters needed to build a full mane of hair, according to Dr. James Harris, director of the Hair Sciences Center of Colorado in Denver. Since the surgery is tricky and time-consuming, fewer than 10% of hair-restoration surgeons do it. Most simply remove a whole strip of scalp and separate out the follicles under a microscope. Strip surgery is painful and takes weeks or months to heal versus just a couple of days’ healing time and less scarring with individual follicular-unit extraction, Harris says.

The new ARTAS robot decides which follicles to collect and plucks them out as the doctor stands by to check its work. The surgeon can watch from the same room or via a remote monitor.

Harris says the time passes quickly as he watches the robot do its thing: “It’s certainly less tedious than doing it by hand. It allows me to think more about the other things I’m going to do with the patient.”

The robot halves the surgery time, Harris says, and surgeons can be trained in its use in a couple of days, rather than the two to three years it took him to perfect the by-hand operation.

Harris developed a blade for the drill tip that the machine uses to punch out follicles without damaging them and licensed it to Restoration Robotics Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., the company that makes ARTAS. His office is one of two that tested a prototype of the machine.

Harris was so impressed he became the first hair-restoration specialist to install the ARTAS robot, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year. He and his fellow testers have already put more than 350 heads under the machine’s care, with no complications, he says.

Since collecting follicles one by one directly from the scalp is so time-consuming and difficult, physicians that do it charge $5,000 to $10,000, Harris says. The robot cost $200,000, but because it saves him time, Harris offers patients a discount if they let ARTAS do the follicle extraction.

story_reviews_00994,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Testing women for human papillomavirus (HPV) may catch more pre-cancerous growths than standard cervical cancer screening does — but more evidence is needed before the newer tests become routine, a study published Monday concludes.

The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government.

The USPSTF is set to update its recommendations on cervical cancer screening, which were last laid out in 2003.

At that time, the task force recommended that sexually active women get regular Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer. But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing — including HPV tests and the “liquid-based” Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version.

During Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes. In the so-called liquid-based version, the cells are placed in special preservative liquid designed to make the specimen easier to “read”; those same cells can also be used for HPV testing (unlike the cells collected with conventional Pap tests).

Exactly what impact the new research review will have on the USPSTF recommendations is anyone's guess. A draft of the guidelines will not be published until Wednesday, when it will be available for public comment on the task force website (here: 1.usa.gov/4xXexl).

A lot of research has been done since the 2003 recommendations, said Dr. Evelyn P. Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review.

But there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and “more complete evidence” is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write.

HPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women.

So in recent years, tests for those “high-risk” HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.)

It has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests.

In their review, Whitlock’s team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version.

They found that both tests had nearly the same “sensitivity” — which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same “specificity,” which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results.

Across studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests.

“It’s reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,” Whitlock told Reuters Health.

In an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient’s. It may not even be the doctor’s — but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of.

Several other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock’s team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate.

In a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing.

The problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue.

“It’s a tricky thing to get your mind around,” Whitlock said. “It may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it’s more subtle than that. You’re trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity.”

Since cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what’s needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing?

And no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests.

Clinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. “The state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we’ll have to keep looking at this.”

Right now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who’ve had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often — every two to three years.

Pap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a “reasonable option” for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS.

Whitlock called Pap testing “one of the big public health success stories.”

Nationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline.

But many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It’s thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who’ve never been screened, or haven’t been in the past five years.

If more women received the screening that already exists, “that would be a huge step forward,” Whitlock said.

An estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer.

However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times.

""If you want to add ginger to part of a healthy diet, that's great. But you can't make any conclusions about definite health benefits"" based on the study findings, said lead author Suzanna M. Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.

The study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research.

Ginger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's ""likely safe,"" although some people may develop mild side effects.

Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.

In the new study, Zick's team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a ""dummy"" placebo pill each day for 28 days. They measured the level of inflammation in the participants' intestines before and after the test period.

The amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. That is probably well beyond what most people would eat in their regular diet, Zick noted. As for cost, she said that a month's supply of similar ginger supplements typically runs about $10 to $30.

The researchers found that the level of inflammation in the subjects who took the ginger pills fell by an average of 28 percent, while staying about the same in those who took the placebo.

If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, ""if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead,"" but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.

Dr. Andrew Chan, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, said the findings are promising because they hint at how ginger may prevent colon cancer.

It's already clear that people with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of colon cancer, he noted. ""We know there are anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin that appear to have anti-cancer properties. And we know there are certain basic mechanisms which seem to be common to both inflammation and cancer,"" he said.

Still, Chan said, ""it's much too early to tell whether ginger has anti-cancer properties.""

story_reviews_00996,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn’t necessarily bad for your health— at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study.

Researchers studying more than 33,000 Swedish women found that the more chocolate women said they ate, the lower their risk of stroke.

The results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren’t a free pass to gorge on chocolate.

“Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it’s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,” Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email.

While she believes chocolate has health benefits, she also warned that eating too much of it could be counterproductive.

“Chocolate should be consumed in moderation as it is high in calories, fat, and sugar,” she said. “As dark chocolate contains more cocoa and less sugar than milk chocolate, consumption of dark chocolate would be more beneficial.”

Larsson and her colleagues, whose findings appear in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, tapped into data from a mammography study that included self-reports of how much chocolate women ate in 1997. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 years.

Over the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk.

Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year. That figure was 7.8 per 1,000 among women who ate the least (less than 8.9 grams per week).

Scientists speculate that substances known as flavonoids, in particular so-called flavanols, may be responsible for chocolate’s apparent effects on health.

According to Larsson, flavonoids have been shown to cut high blood pressure, a risk factor for stroke, and improve other blood factors linked to heart health. Whether that theoretical benefit translates into real-life benefits remains to be proven by rigorous studies, however.

Nearly 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year, with about a sixth of them dying of it and many more left disabled. For those at high risk, doctors recommend blood pressure medicine, quitting smoking, exercising more and eating a healthier diet — but so far chocolate isn’t on the list.

The group eating the most chocolate got the most benefit, reducing stroke intake by 20%. In this group, the median intake (half ate more, half less) was about 2.3 ounces a week.

The research is published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

While other studies have found a link between eating chocolate and reduced stroke risk, this research found a slight difference in protection, depending on type of stroke.

MONDAY, Oct. 10, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental Alzheimer's disease drug, gantenerumab, may help lower levels of amyloid plaque in the brains of people with the disease, an early clinical trial indicates.

The new study, which appears online Oct. 10 in the Archives of Neurology, is among the first to show the effects of an anti-amyloid drug in humans with Alzheimer's disease, but experts caution that while promising, more research is needed before this drug can be deemed safe or effective.

And, in what may turn out to be an equally important caveat, experts also say that it's by no means certain that reducing levels of amyloid plaque would stave off memory loss and the other mental declines associated with the disease because the role of the plaque in Alzheimer's isn't fully understood.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. Symptoms including serious memory loss, confusion and mood changes develop gradually and worsen with time. Recently, many strides have been made in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease earlier, but doctors have been stymied by a lack of effective treatments to stop or slow the course of the disease.

It's long been known that a protein fragment called beta-amyloid builds up in the spaces between nerve cells in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. The new drug, gantenerumab, targets these amyloid proteins by priming the body's immune system to recognize them as invaders.

Of 16 people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, those who received two to seven infusions of the experimental drug every four weeks showed marked reductions in the amount of plaque in their brains via imaging tests that were conducted several months after their treatments.

By contrast, amyloid load increased among people who were randomized to receive the placebo. The new drug was given at either 60 or 200 milligrams (mg) doses. The higher dose yielded greater reductions in amyloid levels, the study showed. People who were given the 60 mg doses saw a nearly 16 percent reduction in the amount of amyloid, and those given the 200 mg doses saw a 36 percent reduction. The new study was conducted and funded by the drug's manufacturer, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., in Basel, Switzerland.

The big question is whether or not reducing amyloid levels has any effect on the symptoms or progression of Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. Patrick Lyden, chief of neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""There is a growing concern that amyloid is a guilty bystander, but not the actual culprit in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and taking away the bystander may not help the patient,"" he said.

There are approximately one dozen therapies, including vaccines, for Alzheimer's disease that are currently in the pipeline, Lyden noted. ""They are all extremely exciting and promising in animals,"" he said. ""This is the first one to show a preliminary result in people, but we have a huge way to go to make sure it is safe and improves symptoms.""

Many in the Alzheimer's research community are awaiting these drugs with bated breath, but ""none are ready for prime time,"" he said.

The leading theory of Alzheimer's disease is that an imbalance in the production or clearance of the amyloid plaque in the brain initiates a cascade of events that lead to dementia, explained Dr. Neelum Aggarwal, an associate professor of neurological sciences at Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

""Accumulation of the plaques cause a variety of cellular responses: inflammation, neuronal death, and thus any potential treatment that can alter these processes would be beneficial,"" she said. The hope is that gantenerumab or other drugs like it will not only prevent amyloid from accumulating in the brain, but also slow down the cognitive impairment that occurs in people with Alzheimer's disease, she added.

That said, these experimental drugs carry the potential for serious side effects, including causing the immune system to go haywire. ""The main issue that remains for this type of drug development is managing the immune response,"" Aggarwal said. Other side effects include a potentially fatal fluid build-up in certain areas of the brain. ""This is problematic in that use of these treatments may carry a very high risk for neurologic complications, thus necessitating heightened monitoring, and diminishing its applicability as a treatment for a larger patient population such as the Alzheimer's disease population,"" she said.

If any of these drugs make it through the pipeline, it also needs to be determined who will get them, including whether the drugs will be given to prevent Alzheimer's in patients at high-risk of the disease or to treat it once it's started.

The need for a drug to delay the onset or slow progression of Alzheimer's disease can't be underestimated, Aggrawal said. In the United States alone, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers are expected to increase to 13 million by 2050, when approximately three of every five people over the age of 85 will have Alzheimer's disease, she said.

story_reviews_00999,"Oct. 10, 2011 -- A small study shows that a new drug being tested for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease reduces the buildup of plaques in the brain associated with the fatal disease.

""The results and especially the rapidity of the effects observed in the gantenerumab trial went beyond our expectations,"" Luca Santarelli, MD, study co-author and Roche senior vice president of neuroscience, writes in an email.

The study is published in the online edition of Archives of Neurology.

Santarelli describes gantenerumab as a drug engineered to bind itself to plaques known as amyloid-betas, which accumulate as Alzheimer's progresses. In the study, patients who received monthly gantenerumab injections showed reductions in such brain plaques.

What is not entirely known at this point, though, is if these plaques cause Alzheimer's or are by-products of the disease. Therefore, it's not known if reducing the amount of them will slow or stop the disease.",Drug May Reduce Plaque in Brains of Alzheimer's Patients,4,Alzheimer's
story_reviews_01000,"LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists conducting early-stage research have found that a potential new drug from GlaxoSmithKline could treat mixed-lineage leukemia(MLL) — the most common form of leukemia in babies.

Signage is pictured on the company headquarters of GlaxoSmithKline in west London July 21, 2008. REUTERS/Toby Melville

In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes.

“This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,” said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study.

Kevin Lee, head of epigenetics discovery research at GSK, who also worked on the study, said he too was excited about the findings, although it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market.

“Even though this is still lab-based ... it validates the idea of developing small molecules against epigenetic switches,” he said in an emailed comment.

“It is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans.”

MLL leukemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults.

Most patients don’t respond well to standard leukemia treatments and often the cancer comes back.

The disease is caused when a gene called MLL gets fused to another gene. This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new “fusion protein” that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia.

Kouzarides’s team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical “tags” on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.

Using I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.

“We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,” said Lesley Walker, CRUK’s director of information.

“Although this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients.”

Leukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children. According to Cancer Research UK, eight out of 10 children with leukemia in Britain now survive for five years or more, compared with one in 10 in the late 1960s.",Study finds early potential in GSK leukaemia drug,1,Cancer
story_reviews_01001,"Sept. 14, 2011 -- Low doses of the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, taken at bedtime, help people with fibromyalgia sleep better and feel less pain, according to a small study.

""Bedtime treatment of fibromyalgia patients with low-dose cyclobenzaprine was safe and appears to be effective,"" says Seth Lederman, MD, president of TONIX Pharmaceuticals, which funded the study.

Fibromayalgia is a condition marked by fatigue, disturbed sleep, and pain. About 5 million Americans have fibromyalgia.

Cyclobenzaprine, marketed in higher doses by others as Amrix, Fexmid, and Flexeril, is already widely used ''off-label'' for patients with fibromyalgia, Lederman says. ""Off-label"" refers to the practice of prescribing medicines to treat conditions not been specifically approved by the FDA.

story_reviews_01002,"In the four-month study, the group randomly assigned to receive intranasal insulin twice a day either improved slightly or remained the same in tests of memory and assessments of their ability to handle day-to-day activities. The lower dose seemed more effective than the higher one. Those who received placebos got worse.

A third also had scans to assess their brains’ use of glucose. One hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is reduced metabolism in the brain, which shows up on scans as less use of glucose, the fuel for brain cells. In this assessment, those getting insulin used more glucose in their brains; those taking placebos used less.

For years, the study’s principal investigator, Suzanne Craft, has studied insulin’s effects in Alzheimer’s. She is professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the memory disorders clinic at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System.

Brain cells need insulin, Dr. Craft said. And conditions in which the body makes too little insulin or is resistant to its effects — diabetes, prediabetes, even untreated high-blood pressure — are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s.

In addition, she said, beta amyloid, a toxic protein that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, seems to tie up insulin in the brain.

So, Dr. Craft reasoned, perhaps if more insulin could be put into the brains of people with the degenerative brain disease, their memories and ability to function might improve. The problem was to find a way to get more insulin to the brain but not to the body.

The solution was a special device made by Kurve Technology that delivers a spray of insulin deep into the nose. From there the hormone travels along the path of nerves into the brain.

The investigators first tried a single dose of insulin delivered via nasal spray to the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Their memories improved temporarily. Then they tried giving insulin daily for three weeks. Again, the hormone seemed to help. That led to the current study, lasting four months.

But Dr. Martha Daviglus of Northwestern University, who led a panel last year that assessed published papers on preventing and treating Alzheimer’s, urged caution. In her field, cardiovascular medicine, she has seen many exciting findings in small studies that fall apart in larger or longer ones.

Now Dr. Craft wants to test insulin again in a much more extensive study. .

In the meantime, she cautions Alzheimer’s patients not to rush out and try to take insulin. It is too soon to say if the treatment is even safe, she said. And patients would need a special device to get it deep into the nose. Kurve’s device is not yet on the market.

story_reviews_01003,"Age is just a number. But for men, that number says a lot about what’s going on in their bodies. Starting at about age 30, men start producing less testosterone, the hormone that helps spark sex drive, build muscle and stoke energy, ambition and aggression. In short, it helps men feel manly.

For all of the talk about “male menopause,” the loss of testosterone isn’t anything like the hormonal nose dive that women go through. Instead of essentially disappearing all at once, testosterone levels usually decline by about 1% every year (although they can drop more dramatically, especially if a man becomes ill).

Men diagnosed with unusually low levels of testosterone are sometimes treated with prescription testosterone injections, patches or creams. Men who want to regain the levels of their younger days without a prescription may be interested in a different route: over-the-counter products that promise to boost testosterone naturally.

TestoJack 100, a supplement from NOW Foods, contains a blend of herbs, including Eleutherococcus senticosus, Tribulus terrestris and Eurycoma longifolia, along with zinc, magnesium and vitamin B-6, among other ingredients. Users are instructed to take two capsules once or twice a day. It’s available at many health-food stores, and you can expect to pay roughly $20 to $30 for a bottle of 60 capsules.

HGH Up, a widely available supplement from Applied Nutriceuticals, contains, among other ingredients, the herbs Chlorophytum borivillanium, Mucuna pruriens and Huperzia serrata, along with green tea, magnesium and a vitamin B complex. Users are instructed to take five capsules every day on an empty stomach — three in the morning and two in the afternoon. A bottle of 150 capsules costs about $60.

The claims

The NOW website says TestoJack “supports male reproductive function and healthy testosterone levels.” The tribulus in the product is said to be especially helpful for “virility.” Despite the suggestive name of the product, NOW doesn’t claim that TestoJack actually increases testosterone, says Neil Levin, the company’s nutrition education manager. “It supports healthy testosterone levels,” he says.

According to the label, HGH Up “promotes radical increases in growth hormone and testosterone production.” The website says that it can provide “the physiological benefits comparable to that of fully hormonal products while minimizing potential side effects.”

Though the product is marketed mainly to weightlifters and bodybuilders, it has a growing following among older men looking for rejuvenation, says Don Orrell, president of Applied Nutriceuticals. “For an older man who has low testosterone, there is absolutely no downside to taking this,” he says.

Orrell notes that the way in which the product boosts testosterone is a bit of a mystery — “that’s the magic pixie dust part,” he says — but he has no doubt that it works. “The anecdotal evidence is overwhelming,” he adds.

The bottom line

Dr. John Morley, a testosterone expert and director of geriatrics at St. Louis University, says that there’s not a lot of scientific evidence for any supplement that claims to boost or “promote” testosterone. And for him, that’s a real problem.

“These sorts of products have been around forever,” he says. “As far as I know, none of them have been proven to work in a carefully controlled trial.”

Some of the individual ingredients in these products have been tested, with less-than-impressive results. In a 2007 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, Australian researchers found that giving rugby players daily doses of Tribulus terrestris for five weeks had no effect on their testosterone levels.

Chlorophytum, one of the ingredients in HGH Up, has long been used as a supposed aphrodisiac for men. A search of the medical literature uncovers a single study suggesting that it may have “testosterone-like” effects, including enhanced sex drive and stronger erections, but the study was conducted on rats, not humans.

Morley often prescribes testosterone for men who have a significant deficit of the hormone, a condition called hypogonadism. The prevalence of this condition is controversial — it depends on how one measures testosterone and defines normal levels — but Morley estimates that 30% to 40% of middle-aged men don’t have enough testosterone to feel their best, sexually and otherwise. Even among these men, about one-third don’t respond to testosterone treatment. In other words, testosterone is hardly a sure-fire remedy against the ravages of aging.

Over-the-counter testosterone products may carry hidden dangers. A 2008 study in Clinical Cancer Research found that two men taking a supplement called Teston-6 developed unusually aggressive, fast-growing prostate cancer. Lab tests showed that the product contained hormones (including testosterone) that weren’t on the label, a common issue with nonprescription products. The manufacturer quickly pulled it from the market.

“The problem with these sorts of supplements is that they don’t have to meet the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration,” says Dolores Lamb, a coauthor of the Teston-6 study and professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.

A man who thinks he’s short on testosterone shouldn’t be looking in a health food store for answers, Morley says. “He needs to go to a doctor to get checked out.”

Qi Sun of the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues analyzed data collected from 13.984 female nurses participating in the Nurses’ Health Study, an ongoing study examining a variety of health issues.

In a paper published online Tuesday by the journal PLoS Medicine, the researchers found that those who consumed 15 grams or less of alcohol a day, which is the equivalent of one drink of any alcoholic beverage, when they were about 58 years old on average were more likely to have good overall health when they were about 70 years old. Those who drank between one-third and 1 drink per day five to seven days a week were almost 50 percent more likely to be in good health when they got older compared with those who did not imbibe.

That was after accounting for other factors, such as smoking. Good overall health was defined as having no major chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, as well as having no significant decline in their thinking or physical abilities.

“These data suggest that regular, moderate consumption of alcohol at midlife may be related to a modest increase in overall health status among women who survive to older ages,” the researchers wrote.

Now, the researchers stressed that wasn’t the case for women who consumed more than two drinks a day or four drinks or more at a time.

Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto.com iStockphoto.com

Nearly three decades have passed since the debate began about a series of symptoms that have come to be known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Its cause is still unknown, but over the years, researchers have identified various brain, immune system and energy metabolism irregularities involved. Some patients describe the syndrome as feeling like an ""unrelenting, unremitting flu.""

Doctors say some treatments can help. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, says patients need to change how they experience symptoms — typically pain, insomnia and anxiety. When patients adopt a more positive attitude, Barsky points out, it often translates into greater confidence and more energy.

A study published this year in the Lancet found that a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients. Researchers from the United Kingdom looked at cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT.

In the study, over 600 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were assigned to different treatments. All of them received medical care for symptoms like pain, insomnia or anxiety.

Hear Joanne Silberner's Report Medical Mystery Of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Returns

One group got counseled about how to pace activities. Another took part in an exercise program. And a third received the cognitive behavioral talk therapy. The therapy and the exercise group improved the most, reporting less fatigue, insomnia and anxiety.

Barsky says his patients do best when cognitive behavior therapy is also combined with gradually increased exercise. ""People need to begin to push themselves in the face of their fatigue, because if you don't, you become deconditioned and you get caught in a cycle which ... makes fatigue worse,"" says Barsky.

But he cautions against overdoing it. People should start with mild, gentle exercise like clearing the table, doing the dishes, or taking the dog for a short walk. Then, slowly build up to longer and more frequent walks, he says.

Lucinda Bateman is a doctor at the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City who specializes in chronic fatigue syndrome.

She's skeptical about the Lancet study, pointing out that patients improved only moderately, and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves. Bateman suggests her patients pace themselves, and try to do only as many activities as they can manage.

She says some patients get caught in a ""push and crash"" cycle. When symptoms abate and they feel better, they may go all out, exercising, doing errands and socializing. But soon that level of activity often comes to a crashing end and patients can relapse dramatically, even becoming bedridden for several days or longer.

Bateman takes also issue with CBT's implication that chronic fatigue syndrome is psychosomatic. We still don't know what exactly causes the syndrome. And, like most professionals who treat patients, Bateman eagerly awaits the day when science can finally pinpoint its cause.

Two years after surgery, duodenal switch patients had lost more weight: about 50 pounds more, on average.

People shed a substantial amount of weight with either type of surgery. Gastric bypass patients cut an average of 111 pounds, while duodenal switch patients dropped about 162.

But those extra pounds came with nearly double the complication rate.

Of the 29 duodenal switch patients, 62 percent had problems like abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and intestinal obstruction. And several suffered long-term malnutrition — something not seen in the gastric bypass group.

Duodenal switch is not a popular procedure. In a 2008 study, it accounted for just 1 percent of weight-loss, or bariatric, surgeries done in the U.S., and 5 percent in Europe.

The technique is often reserved for “superobese” patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 50 or higher — though some surgeons perform it with less severely obese patients too, explained Dr. Torgeir T. Sovik of Oslo University in Norway, the lead researcher on the new study.

“As duodenal switch can be associated with more adverse events, this procedure should only be performed in carefully selected patients by a dedicated bariatric team,” Sovik told Reuters Health in an email. “And a closer follow-up after surgery is required after such procedures.”

But an expert not involved in the study went further.

“This is an operation that should probably go away,” said Dr. Edward H. Livingston, a professor and surgeon at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

The average weight loss seen with either gastric bypass or duodenal switch will improve or reverse obesity-related ills like diabetes, sleep apnea and knee arthritis, according to Livingston, who wrote an editorial published with the study.

So for those medical conditions, it probably wouldn’t matter if a person lost 100 pounds or 150 pounds over two years.

BMI is a measure of weight relative to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal weight, and above 30 is obese.

The patients in the current study were a fairly healthy group despite having a BMI of 50 or more.

After two years, those who’d had a duodenal switch showed a greater improvement in their cholesterol levels. But those levels were near-normal (in both groups) to begin with, Livingston noted.

That begs the question, he said, of whether the extra weight loss “actually accomplished anything.”

“The answer is ‘no,’” Livingston said.

In the U.S., where about 220,000 people underwent weight-loss surgery in 2009, gastric bypass is the most common form chosen.

During gastric bypass, the upper portion of the stomach is stapled off to create a smaller pouch that restricts the amount of food a person can eat at one time. The surgeon also creates a bypass around the rest of the stomach and a portion of the small intestine, which limits the body’s absorption of food.

Duodenal switch is more extensive. The surgeon removes part of the stomach, and the remaining “sleeve”-like stomach is attached to the final section of the small intestine; that puts even greater limits on the body’s absorption of calories and nutrients.

Both surgeries carry the long-term risk of nutritional deficiencies, and people need to take supplements and carefully monitor their diets for a lifetime afterward.

But the risks of nutrient deficiencies are greater with duodenal switch, and include some not seen with gastric bypass, Livingston pointed out.

Some people, for instance, may have severe calcium and vitamin D loss leading to weak and fragile bones. Other problems include severe protein deficiency and night blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency (which is also reversible with extra vitamin A treatment).

In this study, three of the 29 duodenal switch patients developed protein malnutrition, two developed night blindness, and one had a severe iron deficiency that needed to be treated with iron infusions.

Livingston said his advice to people considering weight-loss surgery is to avoid duodenal switch. “It’s just not a good operation,” he asserted.

But he also questioned the value of weight-loss surgery, in general, for severely obese people who do not have medical conditions that stand to improve or resolve after surgery.

In general, experts say that surgery could be an option for anyone with a BMI of 40 or higher; that translates, roughly, to a man who is at least 100 pounds overweight or a woman who is 80 pounds overweight.

Livingston said he thinks more caution is in order when a very obese person is otherwise healthy.

Along with the risks of surgery, he said, there is still uncertainty about whether it actually lengthens people’s lives. Some studies have suggested it might, but not all.

In a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Livingston and his colleagues found no survival advantage among severely obese patients who’d undergone weight-loss surgery versus those who hadn’t.

The study involved 850 U.S. veterans who underwent some form of weight-loss surgery, at an average age of about 50, and more than 41,000 vets who had only non-surgical care. There was no evidence that surgery improved longevity over the next seven years.

“We really don’t even know if there’s a survival benefit,” Livingston said.

That, he added, makes the risks of duodenal switch seem even less worthwhile.

But according to Sovik, duodenal switch might be appropriate for some superobese patients.

In the U.S., he said, about one in three weight-loss surgery candidates have a BMI of 50 or higher. And studies suggest that a sizable percentage of those people will still have a BMI higher than 40 after gastric bypass.

In this study, one-quarter of gastric bypass patients still had a BMI that high two years after surgery — versus none of the duodenal switch patients.

More extensive monitoring after duodenal switch, Sovik noted, can help detect and manage side effects.

He pointed out, though, that larger, longer-term studies are still needed to show whether the extra weight loss with duodenal switch ultimately improves severely obese patients’ health and extends their lives.

story_reviews_01008,"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Gentle yoga classes may help people with type 2 diabetes take off a small amount of weight and steady their blood sugar control, a small study suggests.

The study, of 123 middle-aged and older adults, found that those who added yoga classes to standard diabetes care shed a handful of pounds over three months. Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady — in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing “control” group, whose blood sugar levels rose.

The findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes — a disease commonly associated with obesity.

To really lose weight and rein in blood sugar, more-vigorous exercise would work better, according to Shreelaxmi V. Hegde of the Srinivas Institute of Medical Science and Research Center in Mangalore, India.

Among the 60 study participants who took yoga classes several times a week, the average BMI — a measure of weight in relation to height — declined from 25.9 to 25.4. A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.

“In our study the effect of yoga on BMI (body mass index) and blood sugar control was marginal,” Hegde, the lead researcher on the work, told Reuters Health in an email.

“But,” she added, “it should be noted that yoga controlled the blood sugar levels which otherwise rose in the control group.”

In addition to that, the study found, signs of so-called oxidative stress declined in the yoga group.

Oxidative stress refers to a situation where levels of reactive oxygen species or “free radicals” — damaging byproducts of energy use in cells — rise beyond the body’s capacity to neutralize them. Long-term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases.

In this study, Hegde’s team measured participants’ blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress. They found that, on average, the yoga group’s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.

The significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.

Further, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.

According to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system — the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.

There are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.

In the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.

Older adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions. In the U.S., hospitals and local community centers are increasingly offering such classes.

""We saw two distinct patterns, one of which correlated with heart failure,"" says study leader Vasileios Kechagias, a PhD candidate at the University Hospital Jena.

The device has gas sensors that detect various odorous molecules in sweat. Specially developed software divides patients into groups depending on the pattern of molecules detected.

Aug. 30, 2011 (Paris) -- German researchers say they’re a step closer to developing an electronic nose that can distinguish between people who have heart failure and those who don't.

5 Million Have Heart Failure in U.S.

More than 5 million Americans have heart failure, which occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to pump enough blood throughout the body. Fluid can back up into the lungs, leaving people short of breath.

The new study involved 27 people with heart failure so severe that they were comfortable only at rest, 25 people with less severe heart failure, and 28 healthy people.

The electronic nose correctly identified 89% of the people who had heart failure and 84% of people that didn't have the condition. Still, that means that 11% of cases would have been missed and 16% of people would have been told they had a life-threatening condition when they didn't.

The new device was about that accurate at differentiating between severe and less severe heart failure patients.

The findings were presented here at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2011.

Frank Ruschitzka, MD, of Zurich University Hospital, tells WebMD that ideas that at first seem ""crazy"" can turn out to be lifesaving. ""We need people to swim against the stream. Someone had the idea to put three leads in a device and pace the heart; the pacemaker now saves millions of lives,"" he says.

""Still, much more work is needed before we will know if the electronic nose will make it to the clinic,"" says Ruschitzka, who moderated a news briefing to discuss the findings.

The researchers are now testing more than 1,000 patients and trying to identify the odorous molecules unique to heart failure patients, Kechagias says.",Electronic Nose Sniffs Out Heart Failure,3,WebMD

SUNDAY, Aug. 28, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug, apixaban (Eliquis), appears better than the old standby warfarin in preventing strokes in people with the abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, a new study finds.

Over 2.6 million Americans are affected by atrial fibrillation, and many take warfarin (also known as Coumadin) to prevent dangerous clots that can cause a stroke. Warfarin is notoriously tricky to modulate, however, and needs to be closely monitored -- usually through monthly doctors' visits. If the drug's activity isn't checked regularly it can trigger severe bleeding episodes, the most serious of which can happen in the brain.

""Warfarin is labor-intensive to manage,"" said study researcher Dr. Jack Ansell, chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Sometimes it impairs the patient's quality of life and the outcomes are very dependent on how well the drug dosing is managed,"" he added. ""This [new] drug has a lot of advantages over warfarin.""

With apixaban, patients can use a standard dose that doesn't need monitoring and adjusting, Ansell said. Also, unlike warfarin, apixaban has few interactions with other drugs or foods, he added.

The study was funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the makers of apixaban.

Apixaban is a so-called Xa inhibitor, a class of anticoagulants (anti-clotting drugs) that work by blocking factor X, a protein involved in blood clotting. Ansell expects drugs in this class will have a major effect on how atrial fibrillation is managed in the future.

Another similar drug, Pradaxa (dabigatran), has been on the market for about a year and many patients with atrial fibrillation have been switched or started on it, he said.

""Once [apixaban] is available it is going to be very difficult to avoid offering this drug to patients,"" he said.

The issue of cost remains a factor, however. While generic warfarin is just pennies a dose, any new brand-name drug is likely to be much more expensive. According to Laura Hortas, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, because apixaban is still an experimental drug its price tag remains uncertain.

The new report was published online Aug. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with its presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Paris.

For the trial, more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation and a heightened risk for stroke were randomly assigned to receive either apixaban or warfarin.

Over an average of 1.8 years of follow-up there were fewer strokes or clots among patients taking apixaban (1.27 percent a year), compared with patients taking warfarin (1.6 percent per year), the researchers found.

This means that apixaban prevented six patients from having a stroke, 15 patients from having a major bleeding event and eight patients from dying, the researchers said in a Duke University news release.

The major effect on stroke was preventing hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by bleeding in the brain and is the most serious type of stroke. According to the researchers, apixaban reduced this risk by 50 percent, preventing four patients from having this type of stroke and two patients from having an ischemic stroke (cause by a vessel blockage) or stroke of uncertain origin.

As to apixaban's expected higher price tag, Ansell said that since the drug does not require monitoring and the incidence of stroke and major bleeding are less, savings in doctors' visits and stroke treatment should more than compensate.

The new trial comes on the heels of another study on apixaban that was stopped early due to safety concerns. In that trial, published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine, apixaban's use was associated with raised odds for bleeding -- without providing patients with any reduction in heart attack risk.

However, ""in that case, apixaban was given to patients with coronary artery disease who were also taking two other blood thinners,"" Ansell noted. ""The three of them together showed that the risk of bleeding was just too high and there was no real benefit in that population. But, that's an entirely different problem, compared with atrial fibrillation,"" he said.

Commenting on the latest study, Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles agreed that ""atrial fibrillation substantially increases the risk of stroke and death.""

Warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it also boosts the odds of bleeding and is often difficult to manage, he said.

""Apixaban is now the first oral anticoagulant [blood thinner] to show a statistically significant improvement in survival over warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients,"" Fonarow said. ""This represents a very important therapeutic advance in the care of patients with atrial fibrillation.""

story_reviews_01012,"The new drugs are not without disadvantages. They cost much more than generic warfarin, roughly $8 a day instead of $1 or less. And Eliquis and Pradaxa require two pills a day, one in the morning and one in the evening, instead of the once-daily warfarin. The study included 18,201 people in 1,034 clinical sites in 39 countries and was consistent worldwide, the sponsors said. Although the study was financed by the drug makers, which raises the issue of bias, it met the gold standard for medical research as a randomized, double-blinded trial in which doctors and patients did not know who took which pill until the end. The drug acts on an enzyme that leads to blood clots.

Dr. Christopher B. Granger, the study’s lead author and a professor of medicine at Duke University, said, “I think this is a profound trial result that will have a major impact on the practice and management of patients with atrial fibrillation. It combines both greater efficacy in terms of prevention of stroke with a substantial reduction to bleeding risk, and that package is one that will be particularly compelling.”

Wall Street has high expectations, too. The companies’ stock soared after they released a brief statement about the stroke and bleeding benefits in June. Barclays Capital said the final results on Sunday were “perhaps the most anticipated R.&D. event of the year.”

“If everything checks out,” Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs said in an interview, “that will confirm in our minds that Eliquis has potential to take a majority share of the $10 billion anticoagulation market.”

More than 2.6 million people have atrial fibrillation in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As many as 12 million people will have it by 2020 because of an aging population with longer life expectancy. The arrhythmia in the left upper chamber of the heart can cause slow blood flow and clots, raising the risk of stroke by four to six times on average, the government says.

As many as half of people with the condition, however, are untreated, by varying estimates. Warfarin, a cheap 60-year-old drug sold generically under the brand name Coumadin, requires frequent blood tests to monitor its active level and interacts with some other drugs and foods, including leafy greens. There is great appeal and demand for new drugs that do not vary so much and deliver the same stroke-preventing benefits.

The first new drug, Pradaxa, from the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim, was introduced in the United States last fall. In the first seven months on market, about four in five cardiologists and two in five primary care doctors had prescribed it to more than 250,000 people, Wa’el Hashad, Boehringer’s vice president for cardiovascular marketing, said in an interview last week.

Pradaxa inhibits thrombin, an enzyme in clot formation. Other emerging drugs block a related enzyme known as Factor Xa.

A new study reports that beer is an excellent recovery beverage for marathon runners. But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.

Running a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.

To study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would — in the name of science — be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.

All of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half — about two to three pints — of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men’s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.

For the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.

The men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. “Incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower” in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.

These effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner’s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn’t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. “It can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)” in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.

Just how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage’s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, “suppress viral replication” and “influence the innate immune system positively,” all beneficial for fighting off a cold.

Alcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too — “even more than nonalcoholic beer,” Dr. Scherr said — but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. “We do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,” he wrote. “Furthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.” We all knew that, right?

Of course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation “is very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.”

But the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.

All of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, “When I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer ‘Yes.’”

It’s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. “But with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,” he said, “so nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal” for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race. For that, at least, the beer can be full-potency.",Nonalcoholic Beer Aids Marathon Recovery,2,New York Times
story_reviews_01014,"For patients with high levels of so-called bad cholesterol, doctors routinely reach for two remedies: cholesterol-lowering statin drugs and a diet that cuts out foods high in saturated fat, such as ice cream, red meat and butter.

But new research has found that when it comes to lowering artery-clogging cholesterol, what you eat may be more important than what you don’t eat.

Released online Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., the study found that incorporating several cholesterol-lowering foods — such as soy protein and nuts — into a diet can reduce bad cholesterol far more effectively than a diet low in saturated fat.

In fact, the authors assert, levels of LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, can drop to half that seen by many patients who take statins, sold under such names as Lipitor, Crestor or Zocor. That could drive down a person’s risk of fatal heart attack or stroke by 10%, the authors suggested.

But this doesn’t mean that people on statins should go dump their drugs for tofu, said Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, who was not involved in the study. Dietary changes do not have nearly the research track record that statins have racked up for heart attack prevention, he said.

“Patients don’t want to take the medications, and I’m afraid that if you tell them there’s a diet that works just as well, then they’ll do that instead,” he said.

Nearly 1 in 6 Americans has a high overall cholesterol level, which makes a person nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke as someone whose total cholesterol falls into a healthy range. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is one component of this overall number.

Last year, statin and other lipid-regulating drugs were the nation’s most commonly prescribed medications, with more than 355 million prescriptions dispensed, according to the healthcare information firm IMS Health.

The multi-center Canadian study tested a diet that contained a portfolio of cholesterol-fighting foods such as soy protein, nuts, “sticky” fiber such as that found in oats and barley, and plant sterols. Subjects were instructed to eat a handful of nuts such as almonds or walnuts every day, and to substitute milk and meats with soy and tofu products as much as possible.

One of the most potent cholesterol-busters in that mix, plant sterols (sometimes called stanols), occurs in small amounts in many grains, nuts, vegetables, legumes and fruits and also can be added to foods or taken as a dietary supplement. Plant sterols mimic LDL cholesterol particles in the gut, preventing the absorption of those particles so that they pass through the body and are disposed of as waste.

The 345 subjects in the study, which was coordinated by a team based at St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, all suffered high cholesterol levels and were considered at elevated risk of coronary heart disease. The subjects each followed one of three diets: an “intensive portfolio” diet, a “routine portfolio” diet, or a high-fiber, low-saturated-fat diet rich in produce and whole grains, which is commonly recommended to those who have had had a heart attack or need to lower their cholesterol.

Among the 267 subjects who completed the trial, all three groups lost roughly an equal amount of weight — between about 2 pounds 10 ounces and 3 pounds 12 ounces — after six months. But those on one of the portfolio diets — intensive or routine — saw their LDL cholesterol levels decline between 13.1% and 13.8% after six months.

Subjects on the low-saturated-fat diet had, on average, a 3% reduction in their LDL cholesterol in the same period.

Dr. Walter Willett, a nutrition and health expert at Harvard University’s School of Public Health who was not involved in the study, said that the trial was “nicely done” and that it underscored the fact that “just focusing on reducing saturated and total fat is not the most effective diet for reducing heart disease risk factors or heart disease itself.”

The authors acknowledged that the components in the portfolio diet were well-known for their cholesterol-busting properties. But their research is the first to test the relative effects of those dietary interventions in a real-world comparison, and to gauge how readily people can understand and implement such a diet in everyday life.

It was pretty easily done, the scientists found. Subjects in the intensive group got as many as seven sessions of instruction and guidance, while those in the routine group got one 60-minute session plus a 40-minute refresher — but both groups realized roughly equal benefits.

The researchers also found that the greater a subject’s adherence to the portfolio diet, the more dramatic, on average, was the LDL cholesterol reduction.

But Cleveland Clinic’s Nissen stressed that researchers did not directly measure rates of coronary heart disease — just LDL cholesterol — so the health effects of the portfolio diet are not yet clear.
